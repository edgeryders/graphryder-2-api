Thanks for the hard work and dedication yall :slight_smile:\n \nPolice - Definitely agree, we should not in any terms force anyone to report if they do not want it. But in case of this as you all said, support the victims in their own terms.\n\n\nReporting - Referring to Snurre - this is something that I was thinking about... Sometimes people do not want to report to the police, because they are scared, or shocked, or in denial, or they don't want to deal with it right away. But maybe later on, they can change their mind. I think the most important thing is, that even someone would not want to proceed with the police or other officials, it should not mean we should forget the incident happened. There might be a case where someone would want to report later (also there is a possibility that later on we find out that that person assaulted multiple people), and I think we should have some proof what happened at that time. But as you said, then we have to think about other legal stuff, like how to store this information, who has the right and the key to the information, and so on... In this case it comes complicated. And it is lot of work as you said. I would not mind to do an initiative this, if I was not in the middle of my master's studies and in other projects. :smiley:  I know that Nowhere had some kind of \"report box\", I do not know what they do with the information, or what Borderland for example has, but I can try to find out.\n \nBanning - Sometimes even telling the people that they are not welcome can be enough. I reckon the community is not too big in Sweden, that if the words spreads, it might be enough. Of course we cannot legally stop them, or take any other action that might be actually illegal  in the end ( agreed that we should not act as \"official authorities\"), but let them know \"socially pressured\" that they are not welcome anymore, or possibly some cases after a period of time has elapsed, or they have shown remorse and a change in behavior (in less serious cases - aka. just being sleazy ass).\n\nPhotos - I also think we should not ban taking photos, because most of people want to take them/do not mind, but yes, we need to make sure photos are not taken or shared without consent.\n\nSeparate chat - Agreed that the information should we available for everyone, however what comes to the meetings and consistent communication, maybe the \"urgent stuff\", and meeting appointments could be discussed in Facebook chat? Here it get's kinda lost. Facebook is more clear in that sense, personally find this forum very confusing still hahhah\n\nPins - If not funded, we (Meaghan and I) might get them just as a gift with out own money :slight_smile:  they make a great gift and most people keep them as they are small and a nice memory, and less mooop than other discard-able items. Also a nice memento with an important message! \n\nI created a google drive for Meaghan and I, and would love to share our \"Consent folder\" (I already drafted some trial posters) if we can make a big Urban Burn folder, and then put all the shared files under that?

As i mentioned on the meeting i have been pushing to get some parts of KTH to start coming to frihamstorget during some small promo-gatherings. \nOne of the groups from there is PQ promenadorquestern med baletten paletten. Its a big band jazz orchestra and ballet community that has been there since the darn of time. My fast description of them is that they are the \"burners\" of KTH without knowing it. They are one of the most open artistic and flexible community's there, sometimes seen as sketchy outsiders with their tights playning their 20s music and dancing. As a community they are quite odd too as the are open for almost anyone to become a member, eg you do not need to know how to play an instrument to join their big band orchestra, as long as you participate and do something in the community. So quite burnerish mentality in the openes and the way they are governed. Some of the members like Nygren (bus-responsible person) are long running parts of our community and the node, parts of PQ with their small band OM (orquestermaskinen) has previously had two small concerts in the old node. So its not that strange that i want to get them in deeper in to the rabbithole. That has ofc always been an issue with all planing competition of dates etc, things always are on the same day... But yeah ideas have been maybe to involve them in a concert in frihamstorget in the future? Or who knows maybe gain individual members of makers? or maybe the node wins something, ofc nothing might happen or even more might happen no one knows the limits. As many of you know first \"contact\" is always special and difficult, specially in inviting an organization that has its own infrastructure. But covid19 did it to us, as the toilets are closed on KTH campus and they were planing to have their big bussfix (yeah ofc they got a big artsy bussy thing that is painted as tiger) i suggested it together with Nygren to be in frihamstorget. As the infrastructure is there why not!  This nice oportunity came up the date was chosen as it was the day that the big qArnevalen had been (big makerthing with artsy cars and od contraptions yada yada google it) and most students are free. Hopefully a nice small core-team of them will be available. We might be 4 we might be 14. My hopes are not set high at this particular day its just we offering them some hospitality, who knows they might like the place?\n\nSo the practical stuff, Nygren is bussis eg the responsible person of their tour bus they are planing to have a small gathering and fix stuff on it clean it changing some parts and service it for the yearly bus inspection by the dear state. I offered them to be in frihamstorget so they get toilets a place to grill their food some water and power. They will come at lunch and leave at 18, maybe later. Maybe there is a small micro after-party in the bus at KTH and ofc you are welcome if so practically we do not need to get involved in their bussfix (of you are welcome to) then just talk to Nygren on location.\n\nMy responsibility: im going to host them and see that their needs are dealt to:\nFix watersuply, bring the waterjetcleaner \nFix powersuply\nThey got tools but if something is needed im going to take responsibility for fixing and returning that. \nSe that they got acces to some sort of grill and so on\nSe that they follow practical guidelines LNT etc (they are really good in that manner and trust them 100%)\nOfc as their host i will present the possibilities with the space maybe tour them around some have been there before they will ofc post in their channels about us. \nI will fix with work-music and so on. \n\nSo in practice they will park in the parking-place (we have been there with bus checked a good position) bring some joy and music to the place and then leave with no trace, just a single sparkle of glitter that might grow to something in the future if it does not blow away in the wind.\n\nSo any objections? concerns?  My hope is if the weather is fine that many of you will be there joining in your own projects, there will always be the possibility to help each-other! Its ofc always nice when we got guests that people are there presenting ourselves and representing the area and maybe all together join the grill and drink a couple of cold ones?", "created_at": "2020-05-04 22:05:28.720742", "updated_at": "2020-05-04 22:05:28.720742", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 798, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 106.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 116], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6609, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1360, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@simon?", "created_at": "2020-09-04 22:15:12.749635", "updated_at": "2020-09-04 22:15:12.749635", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6608], "is_liked_by": [109], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7232, "user_id": 18, "topic_id": 1480, "post_number": 1, "raw": "* Diskutera hur ni kan anv\u00e4nda Platoverktygen i era projekt.\n* Skriv ner era id\u00e9er p\u00e5 post-its\n* F\u00f6rs\u00f6k att komma med s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga id\u00e9er som m\u00f6jligt", "created_at": "2020-09-28 16:37:47.509488", "updated_at": "2020-09-28 16:37:47.509488", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 8.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6930, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1443, "post_number": 28, "raw": "I lost the big picture but I think around 7-9 people. just come by, we fix it somehow", "created_at": "2020-09-17 18:12:39.006240", "updated_at": "2020-09-19 12:18:01.424980", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 63.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6922], "is_liked_by": [109, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2254, "user_id": 16, "topic_id": 539, "post_number": 1, "raw": "# Sawing\n**Corded:**\nOver hand Router Bosch\nPlunge Saw Bosch GKT 55 (+ guide rail)\nTable Saw Bosch GTS 10 XC\nDUAB Band saw\nOrbital Sander: Bosch\nCompressor 230 V - in Theos container - ask Theo\n\nplease add more here!\n:hammer:\n:wrench:  \n \n**Cordless:**\nPlunge saw: Bosch GKS 18V-LI (Battery powered) \nSabre saw/reciprocating saw: Bosch GSA 18V-LI\nAngle grinder: Bosch\nScrew driver : Bosch\n\n\n\nCan anyone edit this post?

Can also investigate more affordable alternatives.

I took the F, placed it somewhere, made a test. But, can't find the F! \n\n5. So, I made another one, in cardboard. I've used a bit of diffusion plastic from @Ollxor. This plastic is great, and we can order to cover the rest, but I think we have a lot \"in stock\" if Olle wants to sell/gift it. I used some WS2812B 5V LED's from @ubbesen since they were ideally placed, but we would most likely place our LED's in a pattern that is convenient and effective.\n\n**5. The LED's should be no closer than 1cm (or further away than 2cm), or else the diffusion is not optimal.**\n\n### Next steps\n\nAs I see it, we have 2 paths forward (limiting my imagination heavily here).\n\n1. We decide on the font. Perhaps Annie can help prep the files (since I failed). Tobi plasma-cuts the letters in the 50x50 white sheets and we place them on the container. Ideally, we should paint the white sheets since they are but ugly when white.\n\nOR\n\n2. We attach our lights to the current Frihamnstorget sign (what was wrong with this one? @SofiaAnner) \n\nOR (my currently fave suggestion)\n\n3. We **don't write FRIHAMNSTORGET** but instead choose something a bit more slick as a complement to the already existing sign. Something like \"FT\" or the logo. This would be WAY faster/easier to create and might instil the same curiosity of the bypassers. It might even be the best solution in terms of creating a strong identity for the space.\n\nLet me know what you think. I'll be away until August 12, but happy if these letters get made somehow and then I can attach the lights.\n\n@hampus @hugi @Linnea @Sero    \n\n### Prototype of an F\n\n![ft-sign-led-distance|666x500](upload://ia1QzolT39cRNG2FIZbaR28K1xr.jpeg) \n\n![ft-sign-led-test|666x500](upload://nXwwNQ2ZJCMdZ7FHBDHFmSTVSbh.jpeg) \n\n![ft-sign-test|video](upload://kuOneM275o8dYSUd9pvDMwrLAQk.mp4)   \n\n![ft-sign-test.2020-07-29 20_01_11|320x180](upload://1YrtPz4sqHN0o0pzWeYWr0Cxpzv.gif)", "created_at": "2020-07-29 18:01:55.914126", "updated_at": "2020-07-29 19:29:04.443736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 401, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 179.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 24, 205, 183], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3115, "user_id": 210, "topic_id": 728, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Some thoughts about placement of dancefloor to consider:\n\nAt raves, there's a big dancefloor in the big main room, and a smaller one in the downward left room.

He quickly ran into problems due to the fact that vital components are missing. They were last seen by @gustaf when the machine was moved from Stugan to Tau, packed into a white IKEA drawer/hurts. Looking a bit like this: https://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/0087723_PE217289_S5.JPG\n\nI believe I have seen the piece of furniture lying around, and oddly enough some of the components we did find was stuff that used to be packed with the other stuff. So it seems someone might have emptied this white drawer spreading things around. \n\n**MISSING:**\n\n* Z-axle motor + chain (like a motorcycle chain)\n* Keys (!)\n* Software dongle (!!!)\n* Rubber lining for tube cradles\n* Handle for door\n\n**NEEDED PURCHASES:**\n\n* 8- 10 liters of battery water for chiller\n* Cleaning supplies (rags, microfibre cloth, Ajax etc)\n* Isopropanol\n* Acetone\n\n**REMAINS TO BE DONE:**\n\n* Install laser tube (it's very old + dirty and thus weak. No longer powered at the original 60 w. Hasn't been well taken care of/used with proper caution)\n* Install chiller (cooler?)\n* Calibrate laser beam\n* Sort ventilation\n* Print and laminate rules, tips, guidelines\n* Check and mark lenses\n* Install air assist\n* Fix hatch locks\n* Fix door hinge\n\n@jonasjohansson @Ollxor when did you last see this white hurts/drawer? Was it something that you emptied/moved out when you cleared out the Electronics room? Has anyone else seen it? Not to be confused with the identical drawer owned by Katarina and that is standing on the main mounting room with her supplies. \n\nAll in all it looks a bit grim for our laser cutter. The keys and the dongle are both quite expensive, not to mention a new laser tube with could cost 15-20 KSEK. Even if we get this machine operational its quite worn down and with the existing laser tube it won't be able to cut through thicker pieces of plywood and so on like it used to. I think we should consider leasing a new one, even though that will set us back quite a bit economically.\n\nAlso tagging @Bjorn, @Linus and @antonfrisk", "created_at": "2019-06-24 15:17:08.228948", "updated_at": "2019-06-24 15:30:18.563485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 14.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6810, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1389, "post_number": 3, "raw": "The carpet has been discarded though.", "created_at": "2020-09-14 09:16:07.879114", "updated_at": "2020-09-14 09:16:07.879114", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6219, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 628, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@PianoYuri?", "created_at": "2020-08-17 12:05:37.328979", "updated_at": "2020-08-17 12:05:37.328979", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 2.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6809, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1356, "post_number": 10, "raw": "@Frihamnstorget everyones input is called for here.", "created_at": "2020-09-14 09:15:03.003213", "updated_at": "2020-09-14 09:15:03.003213", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 2.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3659, "user_id": 174, "topic_id": 773, "post_number": 9, "raw": "@Linnea do we have a toastie in the house? if not @cecilia_ulfsdotter is bringing one and i'm bringing sandwiches with extra cheese for breakfast. \n\n@Vinnss if you want to come and start with the container i would love to help out with that :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nCan everyone confirm that 9.30 is a good time to start with breakfast?

I've checked the fusebox and it's running on 20 amps. \n\nI've found the website of the producer of this and will contact them. I think it would be very possible to connect a normal 16A socket to this assuming we should buy the insertion component. \n\nHow much power would we need? If we can make do with 16A (or maximum 20A running on a 32A socket) we could potentially be saving a lot of money. It's a shame that it's such an old installation. In newer buildings they usually run 63A through these canals so we would have been all set had that been the case!\n\nUsing this 20A canal for 16A equipment in Tau would mean that we can't take on other loads while using the 3-phase stuff so we would have to plug all other sockets or make sure to only connect weak stuff like LED lights etc.\n\nThis would be very smooth sailing if we just get the component we need from KB System. Since it's a rail system we just plug in wherever we want along the rail after having removed the plastic cover.

To avoid starting over and over again when something goes wrong, I document my steps with photos and notes that I remember which part I connected how. I learned how to extend cables to each part of the prototype by soldering. \n\n![IMG_4363|375x500](upload://5JVFteNHWz73recBm2NFzpRKNx4.jpeg) \n\nI continued working on prototyping and making the pixel stick more user-friendly. That's why the first cardboard box got a make-over and became more slim. It turned out that this construction allows a smother and more stable usage. During the past days, I decided to focus on developing the creative part of the project as well as thinking about the execution of the open call \"Text Type Light\". It's always nice to have a professional looking tool but if the output doesn't give the effect you wished for, it becomes less meaningful - and my goal is to visualize graphics, text and typography with light. \n\nSo I went outdoors in H\u00f6kar\u00e4ngen where I live and experimented with different light environments. \n\n![24|690x218](upload://faO7zPxiKG8NT57THS46Er8lVAf.png) \n\n![03|690x339](upload://306vuXWaMyaD4mxeeJgnrocV58d.png) \nAfter an hour in the cold, I connected the recorded video I took of myself (while drawing with the pixelstick) with Touchdesigner, a software which shows the actual pixel i had drawn. I reconsidered a few steps and tried more the next day with much better results.\n\n![04|690x467](upload://zRkNPMd9nxQTWT8Ee7iQzJ51ABc.png) \n\n**SUSANNA**\n\nThis week i learned to know how the interactive installation work, how I can connect local objects to the sound and the visual and how i can develop it until the exhibition , which is great.

Before going into my theme ideas, would it make sense to have the week on the autumn break for schools? It\u2019s week 44, 26th Oct-1 Nov. Just an idea in case anyone would like to target young people and children. Given the times we are in I think activities like these could have a huge response from these groups.\n[/quote]\n\nI think this is a great idea! I haven't really thought of Blivande Academy in terms of a specific workshop week, but there could for sure be strong synergies between certain workshops if they can be placed close to each other in time. Would have to be balanced out by the limited time availability and that some participants would then maybe be forced to choose one over the other. \n\n[quote=\"Niki, post:26, topic:1268\"]\nHaving looked through the forum page, I had an idea about possibly combining all these different ideas and activities to fit into the same theme. If Blivande\u2019s mission is for example something around creating a meeting hub for creatives of all ages in Stockholm, we could invite diverse groups of people to come and create something physical together. We can all work on different areas and create an environment and space together, and instead of the participants taking something home with them, the things we create together becomes part of the permanent space that is Blivande. This way it is more collaborative, the community gets a sense of ownership, which makes them feel more at home and part of the space.\n[/quote]\n\nAgain a great idea! We are in a way already doing this as Frihamnstorget is very much a co-created space. Our Work Is Play events on Fridays are literally a standing invitation to the general public to come by and create it with us! \n\nBut that said it could definitely be beneficial to focus a specific group's attention on something more specific and restrained in terms of scope (creativity needs boundaries to flourish after all!). \n\nI'm not personally convinced a cafe is the best way to go simply because we already have a kitchen set up for this and no empty container to transform at the moment. And by far the biggest hurdle to making this a reality isn't the actual physical creation of a cafe space but the long term, continuous staffing of it. That kind of commitment is the genuine treasure that we need to find more of! \n\nBut maybe you are willing to take the lead on such a thing? If so please don't let me get in the way! :slight_smile:\n\nA cafe business run as a co-op would be great!

Do you remember a good example of remote collaboration you had in the past?\n\nOne of the members in this group has a routine at their workplace. In the beginning of each meeting, we do a check-in in the group in which each person can give an update on their status, how they\u2019re feeling and their workload. Each person can decide for themselves how personal and detailed they want to be.\n\nUsing google docs (like we did for this exercise) to work on a common document.\n\nOne person should take notes during digital meetings, so that if someone missed the meeting they can easily get up to speed. This is especially true for working remotely because you can no longer ask someone IRL what you missed.\n\n2. Propose 1-3 guidelines for regular check-in culture\n\n* Start each day with a short meeting just to get started, to make sure everyone knows what they're doing.\n* Have a \u201dfika\u201d break, just talk for a few minutes after lunch every day. It doesn\u2019t have to be about work, it can also be just a check in to see what is up with everyone and how they\u2019re doing.\n* Needs to come from top-down, someone to lead the check-in meetings instead of a free-for-all. A clear structure for the check-in culture. Clear purpose with the meeting.\n\n3. Propose 1-3 guidelines for online calls\n\n* Initially everyone should be using the video function so that the person speaking can see who they\u2019re speaking to. Depending on the meeting, at least the person talking should be using the camera.\n* The participants that are not talking should always have their microphone muted to avoid annoying/disturbing sounds.\n* Instead of just asking questions or start talking out loud, the participants should be using functions like chat and raise hand. Or emojis.\n* Someone should take notes (see question 1).\n\n4. Propose 1-3 platforms you would like to use for different types of asynchronous collaboration (pros and cons if possible)\n\nChat: For conversations that don\u2019t need to be documented, for example questions or opinions and discussions. Pro: The data is not saved. Con: Important information may go missing.\n\nMail: A good platform for contacting external members of the project. Also good for sharing the same information with all members involved in the project.\n\nGoogle Drive: A good platform for sharing files and information with each other. Con: there is a risk that valuable information goes missing if one member of the group edits a document without the rest of the groups agreement, since the information may not be saved anywhere else.\n\nSlack: Forum for discussing different topics and sharing files. Pro: Different channels for different topics.\n\n5. Propose a creative remote social interaction\n\n* Music quiz via Zoom, someone has to take the lead to organize and prepare the quiz.\n* Everyone picks a favourite thing in their home, the most obscure object wins! This creates a more relaxed and open situation where everyone can share something personal without being as person as showing their entire home to everyone at the office.\n* Game night.\n* Don\u2019t talk work.\n\nAgnes Lindstr\u00f6m, Magda Boreson, Clarie \u00c5kesson, Mats Larsson, Sara Karkkonen.", "created_at": "2020-09-24 08:31:00.724116", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 08:31:00.724116", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 47.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7007], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4530, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 978, "post_number": 16, "raw": "It's such a great post, so let's make it its own :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-05-04 16:37:29.982043", "updated_at": "2020-05-04 16:37:29.982043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 2.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 102, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 45, "post_number": 7, "raw": "[quote=\"brooks, post:5, topic:9436\"]\nBut it does stand to consider whether a semi-expensive machine like that(currently they go for SEK 20K-35K on ebay) is a good fit for the vision of Tau.\n[/quote]\n\nI think it might be.

I.e. usability vs comfort level. \n\nTo have permanent fixtures making it easy to quickly hang a nice hammock or two during events (or indeed for someone just wanting to take a nap at the square some afternoon) is of course not that hard to do and would be a nice addition!", "created_at": "2020-06-22 15:21:27.961288", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 15:22:18.997704", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 189, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 46.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6895, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1443, "post_number": 15, "raw": "If it's just 4 we can make a shorter but more intense course cause they don't have to share machines", "created_at": "2020-09-16 09:15:03.566096", "updated_at": "2020-09-19 12:18:01.204745", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 3.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6883], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2090, "user_id": 88, "topic_id": 359, "post_number": 55, "raw": "I was by Wednesday afternoon.

We have made plans to get the woodshop at TAU up and running. Please have a look at them, and give us your input, so all opinions and suggestions are weighed in when we finalize the plans. So far, these are only our suggestions. Think about what would give you the best work flow and the nicest experience in the woodshop, and let us know. Also, if anybody happens to have woodworking skills and/or interest and want to participate in setting up the shop, please let us know!\n\n\u2022 The separation wall between the entrance and the woodshop is torn down, which would give us an 8 meter (and a total of 25 sqm) long woodshop, surely big enuff to work long pieces, or to fit several projects simultaneously.\n\n\u2022 One of the two inner doors is blocked off since it is no longer needed.\n\n\u2022 Along the outer wall we suggest we build a long wooden workbench. It would have a trench for a chop saw and storage for tools and machines underneath (which would make them invisible from outside). The section that crosses the entrance is easily removed when needed, and the section to the far left is designated for hand tool work, so we'd make that section complete with a wooden vice and 'dogs' for holding the pieces.\n\n\u2022 Mirror film (or similar) is mounted on the windows to retain the view whilst not automatically exposing all the expensive equipment to the outside world.\n\n\u2022 To make the woodshop as versatile as possible, we suggest that all stationary machines are mounted onto individual carts on caster wheels. Thus they can be stored along the inner wall when not in use but easily be rolled out when needed. We want to invest in rollers with adjustable height to use as a poor man's outfeed table to various machines.\n\n\u2022 We also want to turn the area opposite the woodshop, by the door to the kitchen, into a storage place, where we can have individual carts on caster wheels for storing our personal materials while we're not here. By building a shelfing system for longer materials above the carts we'd make good use of the space. This should be a communal area, and not only for the woodshop users. \n\n\u2022 We suggest we invest in a combined jointer/thickness planer to complete the shop's machine setup.\n\n\u2022 Look into the possibility of finding an affordable stationery dust extraction system.\n\n\u2022 We thought we'd start by brainstorming together before going into budgeting this thing, so such worldly issues will be dealt with once we know what we want to do, but let's keep our suggestions somewhat realistic.\n\nCheers\nAnna & Jomi", "created_at": "2020-02-14 05:19:30.348707", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 02:44:28.816784", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 458, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 460.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [118, 4, 8, 16, 205], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1936, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 476, "post_number": 31, "raw": "Sorry I missed you today, was at a meeting with the nearby art school Gerlesborgskolan.

Jan Watteus has worked with world famous artists such as William Kentrigde.\n\nCecilia Ulfsdotter Klementsson is an artist currently based in Stockholm, starting a Master in Painting at the Royal College of Art in London 2020 - 2022. Klementsson lived in Perth (AU) 2011 - 2016 where she received a Bachelor of Fine Art at Curtin University 2015. Klementsson has exhibited in Stockholm, Berlin, Leipzig, Perth, and at Dragongate in \u00c4lvkarleby. Klementsson did a three month artist in residence at the Pilotenkueche in Leipzig, October to December 2019.\n\nKlementsson paints fleshy bodies appropriating nudes from fashion advertising by switching genders and extracting colours in the skin. Keeping John Berger\u2019s Ways of seeing in mind, Klementsson takes the nude to naked in painted appropriations, from incorporeal to corporeal. The archives of 1990s and early 2000s fashion advertising feed Klementsson\u2019s work, an era when big fashion brands particularly pushed the boundaries of the nude, with Kate Moss in the forefront.\n\nWhile Klementsson takes inspiration from the suggestive poses, she also twists them by having men pose like women and women pose like men. When we are confronted with opposites, differences in male and female poses become allmore apparent - women seductive but passive, men seductive but active.\n\nThe second aspect challenged in Klementsson\u2019s work is the monochromatic skin tones used in advertising, letting the nude seem more sculptural and less morbid - perhaps a strategy for big fashion brands to get away with nudity.\n\nKlementsson limits herself to four colours only, layered on top of each other like a manual printmaking process. There is a paradox in the colours because they are beautiful yet uncanny while they reveal the fragility of the flesh. It is the mortality which advertising avoids. The viewer sees something is odd, men posing like women and women posing like men, in a transparent iridescent skin, daring the viewer to be drawn to the subjects despite their colourful flaws.", "created_at": "2020-08-17 14:03:20.300427", "updated_at": "2020-08-17 15:27:23.464091", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 506, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 191.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [183], "is_private": false}, {"id": 147, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 50, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2019-01-30 22:09:05.451145", "updated_at": "2019-01-30 22:09:05.451145", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4248, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 952, "post_number": 7, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:3, topic:953\"]\nThe real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind\nThe kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. On some idle Tuesday\nDo one thing every day that scares you\n[/quote]\n\nIt really did.", "created_at": "2020-04-16 21:47:15.999251", "updated_at": "2020-04-16 23:02:21.101179", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 48, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [4252], "is_reply_to": [4248], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8401, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1616, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Just bumping this thread, still haven't heard from anyone about this.", "created_at": "2020-11-14 23:20:29.518484", "updated_at": "2020-11-14 23:20:29.518484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1998, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 359, "post_number": 53, "raw": "@Joannis-Magnus and I will try to get the ventilation installed tomorrow, at least the internal parts inside the container. @elch is planning to be on site on Friday and could most likely make the external exhaust hole larger with the plasma cutter then.

We want this one to be as nice and well made as possible since it\u2019s a great investment and we hope to find someone to run an interesting business in it down the line. \n\nBuilding work to do:\n* Remove and paint all rust. (2-3 days of work for one person. 1 steel brush rust away, 2 cover with vinegar (check with toby if this is advisable), 3 paint rust.) \n* Design window openings (either: a window in one of the long sides or one window in each of the long sides.)\n* Cut window openings (Toby with plasma cutter or anyone with an angle grinder.) \n* Weld support frames for the window and the cutout piece, so we can attach it with hinges. (Toby or Hugi)\n* Design and build interior (does NOT have to be done by the 21th, depending on who will run it at the event. If Roxie or the Node does it we can just put a table inside.)\n\nDecoration/painting alternatives: \n\n1. Keep as is. Might look weird since we\u2019ll paint over the rust. \n2. Paint it red with white corners as blivande!\n\nProgram for the event alternatives: \n\n1. Roxie runs her space bakery all day?\n2. Noden runs a cafe or similar.\n3. Other cafe business.\n\n**Container B Bar / Sauna** \n\nThe plan was initially that Stockholm Brewing Co should run a pop-up bar in this container. Since this seem unlikely to happen we might want to repurpose it for something else. I don\u2019t know exactly what @theodod\u2019s plans are with the sauna, but maybe they want to buy this one from us to use as sauna? Then the sauna will be \u201cbuilt into\u201d our tower, we could also swap it with Container E (the nice office container) and has that one built in instead. \n\nBuilding work to do:\n\n* Remove and paint all structurally compromising rust. (1-2 days of work for one person. 1 steel brush rust away in important spots along beams, doors, connections and corners, 2 cover with vinegar (check with toby if this is advisable), 3 paint rust.) \n* Depending on usage: Design openings, cut them and weld support frames. \n* Depending on usage: Design and build interior.\n\nDecoration/painting alternatives: \n\n1. Keep as is. Might look weird since we\u2019ll paint over the rust in certain spaces.\n2. Only paint the frame (where the majority of the rust fixing has to be done) in a new colour and keep the walls as is. Could be nice together with Container A.\n\nProgram for the event alternatives: \n\n1. Stockholm Brewing Co runs a popup bar. Still waiting to hear a definitive NO from Niklas. \n2. Sauna?\n3. Something completely different.\n\n**Container C Decorative - Beckmans**\n\nThis is the container on the \u201csecond floor\u201d of the tower. We will not use this container at this stage because of complicated rules about heights. In the future we might repurpose this as our office. \n\nBuilding work to do:\n\n* Remove and paint all structurally compromising rust. (1-2 days of work for one person. 1 steel brush rust away in important spots along beams, doors, connections and corners, 2 cover with vinegar (check with toby if this is advisable), 3 paint rust.) \n* Roughly remove large rust spots on the walls.\n\nDecoration/painting:\n\n* Beckmans runs a painting workshop on it on the 5th of September.\n\n**Container D Plants - Ecosystem container**\n\nThis is the container on the top floor of the tower. This container will have a cut out pattern with plants inside. This project is mainly Jakob and Nicke\u2019s, and a sort of prototype of how to make \"movable biodiversity hotspots\". \n\nBuilding work to do:\n\n* Remove and paint all structurally compromising rust. (1-2 days of work for one person. 1 steel brush rust away in important spots along beams, doors, connections and corners, 2 cover with vinegar (check with toby if this is advisable), 3 paint rust.) \n* Design and cut out pattern. (Jakob with an angle grinder. Will take a lot of time.) \n* Build drainage and water system inside. (Nicke designs but doesn\u2019t have too much time to build, preferably we can get a team together to build it.)\n* Fill with soil and plant plants. (This very much needs to be done before we lift it on top.)\n\n**Container E - The Nice One, Office space**\n\nThe nicer and more expensive container we have bought, that we might furbish and rent out as office space in the future. I propose that SH can use this one for their kids activities throughout the event? This one will be freestanding and used as support for the space. \n\nBuilding work to do:\n\n* Not much need to be done before the event.\n* For the office space we\u2019d need to design an interior and windows.\n\nDecoration/painting:\n\n* No idea. Let\u2019s paint it gold.\n\nProgram for the event: \n\n* SH runs a thing for kids.\n\n**Container F - WCH Container 1** \n\nThis one will be freestanding and used as support for the space. I suppose we do not want to use it for the event as we then need to remove everything from inside?\n\n**Container G - The Space Container**\n\nThis one will be freestanding and used as support for the space. I suppose we do not want to use it for the event as we then need to remove everything from inside? In case there is another need for a container for activities I guess this one will be the easiest to empty.\n\n**_Container H - WCH Container 2_** \n\n_* Still in Hedeland. Depends on if we can get it here in time. It is not necessary for our setup._\n\n**Things to keep in mind:**\n\n* One of the containers need to have a nice painting of Containertj\u00e4nst\u2019s Logo, we promised them this in exchange for the low price.

For example Always Becoming Festival at Frihamnstorget, Malm\u00f6festivalen 2021, or Nacka Kommun \"New ideas for the town center Spring 2021.\"\n* Should be changed to something that does not imply it has to be an actual event. Suggestions: **Fund** (Most accurate, but people might not get it.) \n* What we call this is not super important as most end users will not see this level. \n\n**Idea**\n* What was previously called a Dream, a project proposed by a member on the platform. Idea is less specific than dream, lowers the bar for submitting, and highlights the personal initiative-aspect of the platform. \n* Other contenders: **Dream**, **Project**\n\n**Proposal**\n* An idea that is eligible for granting. A new thing, sort of what was previously called a \"Dream approved for granting\". I think it's a good idea to differentiate between **ideas** on the idea stage, and fleshed out proposals. \n* An **idea** becomes a **proposal** by the help of other members of the community, via comments and raising flags and so forth.\n\n**Project**\n* An idea that has received funding from the platform. Previously \"Realised dream\" or something like that. \n* A **proposal** becomes a **project** by being realised. This term won't be used much.\n\n**Budget**\n* **Funding sought** - The amount of funding needed to realise the idea. Was previously \"Max funding\".\n* **Minimum funding** - A lower amount than **Funding sought**, that can be used to make a slimmed-down version of the idea. \n* **Expenses** - The budget item costs of the idea.\n* ***Income*** - Existing funding already in place to realise the idea. This need to be changed to something clearer, e.g: **Existing funding**\n\n**Flag**\n* The various issues other users can raise on an idea. I wonder if we really need a specific term for this or if we can use the specific name of the specific flag instead?\n* Flags works, but is a bit vague. Would be good with a term that highlights that the thing needs to be looked into for the idea to be eligible for granting, \"look into this\". Could be changed to: **Issue** (a bit too negative), \n\n**Granting / Grants**\n* The process by which the community distributes the allocated budget.

I\u2019m from Stockholm and am moving back from London in a few weeks.\n\nI am really interested in contributing in any way to Blivande and Frihamnstorget! I\u2019m sharing what I wrote to Maria in an email below, so you can read a bit about my thoughts on the workshop week!\n\nI have done a bit of thinking around the workshop week at Blivande. Before going into my theme ideas, would it make sense to have the week on the autumn break for schools? It\u2019s week 44, 26th Oct-1 Nov. Just an idea in case anyone would like to target young people and children. Given the times we are in I think activities like these could have a huge response from these groups. \n\nI looked through the forum page, and the main goal of the week seems to be to make use of all the skilful people that are involved in Blivande. It is also a way to do something community based in these socially distant times. \n\nHaving looked through the forum page, I had an idea about possibly combining all these different ideas and activities to fit into the same theme. If Blivande\u2019s mission is for example something around creating a meeting hub for creatives of all ages in Stockholm, we could invite diverse groups of people to come and create something physical together. We can all work on different areas and create an environment and space together, and instead of the participants taking something home with them, the things we create together becomes part of the permanent space that is Blivande. This way it is more collaborative, the community gets a sense of ownership, which makes them feel more at home and part of the space. \n\nJust as an example, from the top of my head, if we would all work towards repurposing one of the containers in the Blivande box park into a communal area/caf\u00e9, open to all. (This would also create revenue to Blivande with the caf\u00e9 business) Some people work on the benches Maria posted about. Some people curate an exhibition area for young aspiring artists to exhibit and sell their art. Some use the laser cutter to make plates and cutlery for the caf\u00e9. Some design how to transform the caf\u00e9 into an event space in the evenings where there could be community lead courses or open-mic poetry evenings (maybe they need to laser cut or build collapsible chairs for this.) Some people might just want to focus on the decor, for example create a mosaic ceiling. It would all be pre planned to some degree so we can have the masters and materials needed, but it should also be quite open-ended I think, so that the community have room to shape the end product as well. \n\nLet me know what you think. I think it could be really nice and fun, and would love to be part of making something like this happen. I have experience in laser cutting, wood workshop, Arduino, graphic design, print making (would be great to make use of in this event) etc so can contribute with holding workshops as well as creating visuals and promotional content as well. \n\n:slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-08-19 15:30:53.917158", "updated_at": "2020-08-19 15:30:53.917158", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 554, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 165.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34, 8, 4, 109], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1555, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 359, "post_number": 27, "raw": "Take care, the measurements from hampus sketch are the outside measurements.

Of course, the leads of the event can decide if they want to enforce it or not. we just write down such people's names and social security numbers and put them in a list that could be circulated between different events organizing teams. We can discuss the process in a call of how to deal with valid questions Filip raised.\n* **REPORT** - **YES** to POLICE. But we should only do it if the victim is ready. He/she should just know that they have all our full support if they want to do it including, our commitment to give them any level of anonymity they want from the public eyes. So I agree that 1st communication is with the victim(s).\n* **SHIFTS** - Agree again. But if we encourage people enough it is possible.\n* **PIN IDEAS** - great again but I doubt if we will have the money. What if we create the designs and ask participants to make one for themselves in some neon colors. We can also ask to get it sponsored by some organization that works in this area (without breaching the principle of commodification).\n* **CONSENT INFO SHEET** - Yes please. :) Please put it in UB Google drive so we all have access.\n* **POSTER PRINTING** - IF we don't get enough budget, I will have no concerns in using my own company's printers to print them in color on A3-A4 sizes. I am 100% sure, people in our facility will not have a problem if I print 30-40 pages. This is too important to avoid and we cannot see this as a cost. I will ask them next week already about this.\n* **TAKING PHOTOS** - Absolutely clear communication that they are not allowed. We can also buy stickers to be put on the cameras. Not very expensive. If they violate it, they can be thrown out of the event.\n* **SEPARATE CHAT** - I AM NOT in favor to make a separate chat for it. Let everyone read this forum thread on this topic. However, I will suggest having separate regular virtual meetings (like yesterday), between this group of roles you are suggesting. A topic such as this needs to be discussed more interactively instead of just reading it and then writing. It also will create more engagement.\n\nThis is all from my side for now. If you do not agree to any of my points, please don't mind raising your objection :smiley:\n\nHave a wonderful weekend.

If care and proper operation is neglected this can result in damage to the machine and fire hazard.\n\nTo be able to safely operate and properly make full use of the laser cutter, knowledge of the bits in the following list is essential. Its is a long list, but most items are quite simple and straightforward. Make notes as you learn about them. If you feel that all the points on this list are clear to you, then you have a full grasp of how to operate the laser safely and with good results. However, if anything is unclear, just ask away and someone can show you.\n\nThe machine is fantastic for so many reasons, and you can do so many different things with it. Lets keep it that way and see to that you get to have full use of it!\n\n**Basic hardware and Mechanics:**\n*Parts - Gantry, cutting table, laser tube, laser head, rails, control panel*\n* Mirrors\n* X and Y-axis\n* Z-axis\n* Lens and lensholder/mouthpiece\n* Liquid cooler - water level, temperature\n* Compressor\n* Evacuation fan\n* Safety Sensor\n* Emergency Breaker\n\n**Machine controller:**\n* Speed Adjustment\n* Power Adjustment\n* Movement of laser XY axis\n* Test (Area)\n* Start/Pause and Stop\n\n**Running Machine:**\n* Uploading file\n*  Selecting file\n*  Setting area\n*  Setting Focus\n*  Deleting files\n\n**Checklist - Lid, fan, cooler compressor, fire hazard, number of files on laser**\n\nLenses:\n*38,45,108mm*\n* Uses and differences\n*  Air nozzle extensions\n*  How to switch lens\n*  Focusing\n\nRegular Maintenance:\n\n* Empty waste tray\n* Wipe cut table\n* Check lens and Mirrors, clean if necessary (acetone, non-abrasive wipe such as microfibre or soft paper napkin, cue tips)\n\n**DO NOT USE RECYCLED TOILET PAPER OR SIMILAR FOR LENSES/MIRRORS, THEY CONTAIN SILICATE PARTICLES THAT SCRATCH THE SURFACES**\n\n* Keep area neat\n* Checking mirror calibration ( Painters tape over entry hole of laser head, and clear tape for the nozzle alignment is recommended, check opposite corners of cutting canvas)\n\n**Deeper Maintenance:**\n\n* Cleaning and lubing rails (wipe off old grease before applying new, as this contains abrasive particles)\n* Washing knife table and honeycomb table\n* Washing/cleaning inside of machine\n* Calibration of mirrors (This takes a bit of knowledge and time. Painters tape for first three places, and clear tape for the nozzle alignment is recommended, as is patience and methodical approach)\n* Cleaning of laser tube emitter **RESIDUE ON THIS WILL CAUSE DROP IN POWER AND HEATING OF THE TUBE**\n\n**Lasercut 5 Software:**\n\n* SoftDog hardware key and it\u2019s quirks\n* Importing formats (dwg, dxf, ai ver.8, bmp)\n* Checking file\n* Basic tools (scale, move, align, flip)\n* Array settings\n* Layers/colors and their order\n* Power and speed settings\n* Setting laser origin\n* Engraving closed vectors, power, speed, scan gap\n* Engraving raster images (bmp), 600 dpi, 2-bit, dithered\n* Exporting to machine (download over usb cable or usb memory)\n* Double file jobs, output tick box\n\n**Checklist: Artifacts outside machine canvas, output order, power settings, origin**\n\n**Material properties:**\n\n* Acrylic, mirrored acrylic <10mm\n* Polycarbonate (PC) <3mm (Produces foul smell and residue, check ventilation and clean up properly afterwards)\n* Polypropylene (PP) <3mm (Produces a lot of fine white residue in machine, please do proper check of lens, mirrors and if cut in quantity, laser tube emitter)\n* MDF <8mm (depends on quality) (Produces a lot of tar residue on cutting table, please clean up before it dries up)\n* Plywood <8mm (depends on quality)\n* Wood, thickness and result varies on type\n* Paper\n* Cardboard (Highly flammable, observe machine at all times, and go fast)\n* Balsa\n* Leather (Smells like burnt hair)\n* Latex (non-chlorinated)\n* EVA-foam (May be combustible)\n* Extruded polystyrene (EPS, XPS) <50mm (Highly flammable, observe machine at all times, and go fast)\n* Laser ply (double material for two-color engraving)\n* Laser rubber (stamp material) (Smells foul)\n* Stone, ceramics, glass, anodized aluminium ( Engrave only! May take experience to get good results)\n\n**NO GO MATERIALS**\n\n* Vinyl, vinyl decals, PVC **(NOT TO BE USED PRODUCES CHLORINE GAS, REALLY BAD FOR YOU AND MACHINE)**\n* Fake leather, unless its known to be **non-chlorinated** PU (PolyUrethane). See above under Vinyl.\n* Metals (The machine is not powerful enough, nor suited to either mark, engrave or cut metals, with the exception of anodized aluminium, see above)\n\n**General Rules:**\n\n* Using the machine without proper knowledge is prohibited\n* Do NOT leave machine unattended when it is working (stay close and have a look at regular intervals)\n* Do not cut materials you do not know\n* Check lens and mirrors regularly\n* Check level of coolant and cooler temperature regularly\n* Do not run machine at 100% for prolonged times (>1 minute)\n* Clean up after you use the machine\n* If there is something not working properly, make note of it and let others know so it can be fixed\n* Material not marked is up for grabs, just check that you know what you are cutting\n* Replenish materials if you are able to do so\n\n**Known quirks:**\n\n* The laser has been known to, under non-active moments, to \u201cghost-travel\u201d. The Y-axis starts moving slowly along, for no known reason. Just restart machine and it should be fine. A theory on this is is that it is the result on adjusting speed on the machine.\n\n* When using LaserCut5 on the computer next to the laser, setting the speed under 10mm/s results in it crashing.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Note the settings you are using for different materials for later use\n* Keep your personal ready-to-go laser cut files on a USB-stick\n* Do test cuts! Try on a small piece before endeavoring bigger jobs!\n* Google is your friend, and so are the other people in Stugan.

We have a closed project group for the team, but it is only to be used sparingly. This transparent way of working is in the Edgeryders DNA. It has many great benefits, but it may take some time to get used to. Some of you, like @hampus, @jakobskote and @gustav will already be pretty used to this from how we work in our projects. To see an Edgeryders team in action, you can have a look at the [EarthOS unit forum](https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos).\n\nThere is a good introduction to the Edgeryders [principles for collaboration and operations](https://edgeryders.eu/t/principles-for-collaboration-and-operations-in-edgeryders/8729) on the Edgeryders platform. I have modified taken out the most important principles for this project:\n\n1. **Working out loud (and in writing)**. We communicate by being transparent, and letting each person decide which information she wants. This means we do not send each other emails (strongly discouraged within the company, a necessary evil when dealing with the outside world). Almost our entire workflow happens in writing on the company\u2019s online workspace. This way, everything is written down, has a URL and is searchable. For short-lived communications (\u201cHave you paid XYZ\u2019s invoice?\u201d) it\u2019s OK to use a chat message, but anything substantial needs to be on this platform to be findable and open.\n\n2. **You are responsible for staying in the loop, not for keeping others in the loop**. Once you have documented what you do on the platform, you\u2019re good. No one can accuse you of being untransparent or not keeping them in the loop. We do this because we value doers and their work. Doing more does, in Edgeryders, come with a responsibility of documenting what you do, but no more. Once the documentation is there, no one is allowed to claim ignorance of it as a way to accuse the doer of not being proactive enough in communicating. This is a way to protect doers from vetoes or sniping from non-doers. If you want to be informed on a project, read upon it. It\u2019s all there. For example, you can set to \u201ctracking\u201d the relevant categories and topics on the platform.\n\n3. **Administrative minimalism**. We recognize the need for tidy process, especially at the low level. At the same time, we are strongly averse to useless paperwork, and determined not to have anyone doing the [bullshit job ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) of creating administrative processes for others. Admin work is almost always unpaid in Edgeryders, to make sure our incentives stay aligned with not having any beyond the bare minimum.", "created_at": "2020-03-26 23:00:38.131582", "updated_at": "2020-03-26 23:00:38.131582", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 463, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 138.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [18, 34, 8, 317], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3114, "user_id": 185, "topic_id": 728, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I'm working on a picture with some extra info.

I now strove to rouse him\u2014\u201cQueequeg!\u201d\u2014but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage\u2019s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.", "created_at": "2020-04-16 23:35:31.928453", "updated_at": "2020-04-16 23:35:31.928453", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 465, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3354, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 767, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yes, on the matter of reimbursing.

We have sold thousands of tickets over the years to Urban Burn, Afterglow, Ascension, etc and I don't remember a single instance of anyone requesting to do this.\n\n[quote=\"Joannis-Magnus, post:1, topic:991\"]\nSome of them have been more apparent during covid19. Mostly tickets sales go under customer rules and give the \u201ccustomer\u201d the right to cancel sale in 14 days or get money back if \u201cevent\u201d is cancelled.\n[/quote]\n\nFor the festival, I've been thinking that we could sell something else than a ticket to a single event. What you buy from Blivande could be a ticket that gives you the right to sign up for a \"series of events, workshops and trainings\" between June 2020 and June 2021. One of these events would be the multi-day festival, which we provisionally schedule in September but which could be pushed as far as June next year if needed. But regardless of if we need to push the festival, the ticket gives access to the mini-workshops, events, and training we will run at Tau and Frihmanstorget this summer, as well as access to Tau if you are working on one of those projects. That way, people start getting something out of their tickets immediately, including the right to vote on the funding of projects.\n\n[quote=\"Joannis-Magnus, post:1, topic:991\"]\nI think it is time to see if we can develop this even more at some point we will need this in frihamstorget too.\n[/quote]\n\nI think this is a pretty good idea, yes.

I'm going to try and answer the questions that came up, I hope it's understandable what we want to express. \n\n---\n\nFirst of all, let me address the last question posed by Hampus: \n[quote=\"hampus, post:2, topic:867\"]\nWhat\u2019s your particular twist to it?\n[/quote]\nAs far as we are concerned, we do a specific fusion of interactive art, participatory art and happenings. \nSo to answer the question indirectly: what makes this project unique is not necessarily the object, but the type of interaction it is used for. \n\nThe general idea is to create a room that people can use freely. What is most interesting to us will be how people will interact with the container, with it's visual effects. Everything else is secondary. While we certainly plan to do some happenings there ourselves, it's not the idea that we use that space, or give rules to obey. The most difficult part of this, to the two of us, is to see what was done.\nWe were thinking about either a guestbook that could be filled out; or a videocamera or photocamera that get into action when something happens in the container. \n\nWe want it to be descided by the community of blivande, which observation methode will be chosen. \n\n\n---\n\n[quote=\"hampus, post:2, topic:867\"]\nWould it be a year around (insulated) space?\n[/quote]\n\nWe would love for it to be integrated into the general space, whatever that means. Again, this would be up to you to descide. The closer to the daily hotspot, the better. \n\nBecause of this, we would also need to know what container could be placed. (The measurements)\nWe would want to do let it be accessable all year round though. \n(I hope that with this and the first answer, the \"general use\"-question was answered aswell)\n\n---\n\nThe budged depends on the size of the container. But we plan to apply for an art-grant to cover all of the costs, excluding electricity, if that answers the question.\n\nWe plan to use either acrylic plastic mirrors, or mirror-foil. But we will build it so that it can be exchanged easily. Meaning: There will be the possibility to exchange from foil to acrylic. \n\nThe infinity-mirror looks amazing, but most probably, we will use regular mirrors first. The option to change it to infinity-mirrors will be there, but we feel as if a lot of interaction with your own reflection will be lost because of it. \n\n---\n\n\nWe would be glad for your thoughts/opinions/answers on our questions for the blivande-community. \nAlso, if you have any other questions, ask away!\n\nGreetings and hugs, Jonas", "created_at": "2020-04-12 13:07:38.155397", "updated_at": "2020-04-12 13:07:38.155397", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 460, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 118.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [3864], "is_reply_to": [3864], "is_liked_by": [4, 129, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5296, "user_id": 253, "topic_id": 867, "post_number": 11, "raw": "It would also be great to know whether you have some building-equipment available at the site. \nWe would need a welding-machine and a drill able to handle metal (basically, we are looking for hardened drillbits). \n\nGreat to hear from you all again, great effort you do atm!", "created_at": "2020-06-06 17:13:28.511830", "updated_at": "2020-06-06 17:13:28.511830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 49, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [174], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2176, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 359, "post_number": 60, "raw": "Excellent and vital info Dan!\n\nIt merits its own sticky thread actually.\n\nWant me to show you the container today?", "created_at": "2019-12-09 12:30:29.600734", "updated_at": "2019-12-09 12:30:51.698349", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [2175], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3968, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 879, "post_number": 8, "raw": "https://www.twitch.tv/exploringtechnology", "created_at": "2020-04-04 14:26:56.736346", "updated_at": "2020-04-04 14:26:56.736346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5314, "user_id": 205, "topic_id": 867, "post_number": 12, "raw": "[quote=\"BlueBrain, post:11, topic:867\"]\nIt would also be great to know whether you have some building-equipment available at the site.\nWe would need a welding-machine and a drill able to handle metal (basically, we are looking for hardened drillbits).\n[/quote]\n\nHey guys! \nGreat to read your update, excitedto see more about what you come up with.\n\nThe placements are mainly a question of collaboration and communication with the existing initiatives, so it works for everyone already at the square and also keeping within the zone we rent so far. \n\nThere are some equipment at the square, @elch  and/or @Thedodod would be the ones to ask about this!\n\nTo my knowledge there is no specific deal with containertj\u00e4nst, but maybe @hampus knows more about this.", "created_at": "2020-06-08 13:15:09.308139", "updated_at": "2020-06-08 13:18:57.696128", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 129, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [5296], "is_reply_to": [5296], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5342, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 867, "post_number": 15, "raw": "[quote=\"SofiaAnner, post:12, topic:867\"]\nTo my knowledge there is no specific deal with containertj\u00e4nst, but maybe @hampus knows more about this.\n[/quote]\n\nContainertj\u00e4nst has now moved out from Frihamnen so most of the benefits of working with them specifically are no longer there in practice.

I am not worried about throwing someone out, if we really have to, because we will have security that can do that for us.\n* **POLICE** - I agree with you and will clarify here that I didn't mean we should go to the police.

I.e. stuff that impacts the project and the square in this case as a whole, as opposed to something that is within someone's personal domain only. That's a fundamental difference to me.\n\nIn other words there's a big difference between the placement of the dome or how a big and prominent container wall is painted and whatever someone decides to do inside their own container. One is a \"commons\" and the other is private. And then there are of course \"grey zones\" in between the two opposites. It's not a binary black or white distinction. \n\nThe fact that Frihamnstorget is a permanent and public project interfacing with the general public, Stockholms Hamnar, authorities etc. makes it fundamentally different from Borderland or Urban burn. Here lies a very important distinction that I think it's important that we keep in mind as thing evolves! It's easy to apply methods and culture from one familiar context to another that is seemingly very similar, but that can also lead one astray and into unexpected conflicts. \n\nAt Borderland for example everything is temporary and there's plenty of space for everyone to express themselves freely. If a particular camp, installation, show, DJ or anything else isn't your cup of tea you can simply lift your hat and move on to the next. With the limited space and more restrictive parameters at Frihamnstorget we can't afford the same luxury in the long-run. Something that comes with both pros and cons. \n\nPersonally I find it really exciting and new to be exploring this more unfamiliar territory together with you all! \n\n[quote=\"Simon, post:8, topic:1053\"]\nLet me be the first to \u201cg\u00f6ra om, g\u00f6ra r\u00e4tt\u201d\nHampus!

Then we solve the whole looking inside issue without having to mount the mirror film. But then again maybe the sun blinding was another reason for the mirror film? Can be solved with blinders.\n\nYou specifically want to use wooden boards I assume? Would look cool and more organic so I'm not complaining! \nBut just so you know I have a shitload more of those white metal sheets for standardized hooks/boxes/etc if we want to use that instead.

Then we can allow ourselves to go for the higher end plywood for everything else (and upgrade in the future when we have more money). \n\n[quote=\"Jomi, post:22, topic:647\"]\nAs you can see on the attached excel sheet\nthe price spans on plywood in table 1 indicate various qualities of plywood. The lowest figures would mean cheaper material, but possibly some extra work and a somewhat shittier interior in the shop, whereas the more expensive end would mean quicker assembly and a nicer result. I\u2019d personally go for the upper price range.\nDoors to the cabinets underneath the workbench would mean an additional cost as well, same gpes for the shelves. The price spans for the total cost of the shop are presented in table 2.\n[/quote]\n\nI absolutely think we should go for the better quality plywood. We will only do this once (at least in the next 10 years) and the price difference is definitely worth it in the long run. We should definitely go for cabinet doors as well. Keep the saw and sanding dust out. It does mean people will have to learn to look around for things properly (and also return them to their proper - marked - place). But I have hope this can happen eventually (despite finding people were using napkins instead of toilet paper the other day, when there was more toilet paper in the cleaning room...). \n\n[quote=\"Jomi, post:22, topic:647\"]\nThen there is the financing of all this stuff\u2026 We talked about a support party to raise the funds needed, and @hampus would write a post on the forum, but I guess we\u2019re chilling with that due to pandemic-type stuff\u2026\n[/quote]\n\nYeah, fundraising party has to wait but should happen as soon as it's possible to have larger events again.

With your safety being of utmost importance, and for the safety of the Unmagicals, we will deploy our professional resources to check all channels through which the Unseen operate their communications, thereby putting into effect the SAFETY AND PRECAUTION MEASURES - STAGE 7 protocols. Hence, we advise you to be co-operative and to let our monitoring procedures run as malleably as possible. You are kindly urged to limit, terminate and/or postpone your current magical correspondences by midnight. Resistance will not be tolerated as the C-virus seems to act more severely with magical hosts.\n\nREMINDER:\nSome of the symptoms of C-virus infection:\n\n* Coughing sand\n* MHS (Medusa Headache Syndrome)\n* Shapeshifting (to be confirmed)\n\n*\u2013 posted on the 21st of March, 2020, at 12:00 pm*\n\nUPDATES:\nDear Unseen community:\n\nMembers of the International Unseen Police Organization have found the body of an unidentified 25-year-old female Magical near Magnam Silvam. The deceased is suspected to have been in mid-biotransition (shapeshifting) before her demise. The reasons behind this incident are still unclear to forensics \u2013 however, there is a high probability that the C-virus is the chief cause.\n\nA press conference will be held this afternoon with regards to the unfortunate event.

This is fine if your goal is just to allow people to get _money_. But the truth is that access to funds is not the reason for why Dreams or Hoffnung were built in the first place.\n\nIn 2016, the [original version of Dreams (still online!)](http://creations.urbanburn.se/) did not even have a granting mechanism. It was, first and foremost, a way for people to make each other aware of what they were planning to create and how others could co-create with them. In my view, this is still the _most important function_ of Dreams, even at the Borderland! Access to funding is only the incentive that drives engagement to the platform, which in turn makes the networks of co-creation denser and richer.\n\nHoffnung takes this a step further by also helping you along the way by suggesting ways in which you could co-create by sharing resources and spaces. In my view, this would really give rocket fuel to Urban Burn if implemented well.\n\nA Google Form, in contrast, is much harder to interact with to get inspired.

Or we do have the plastic \"fake wood\" flooring that I bought for the laser container. Should be around 15-20 m2 left or something. It's relatively easy to clean/wipe off but you do have the minor <1 mm cracks in between the tiles. So water/moisture would go down through it a bit. I guess you could use bathroom silicone or some water-resistant glue when you put it down to stop that from happening. Probably not the ideal solution but cheap as in free (material, will be time consuming of course). \n\nI would love to buy vinyl carpet in black/white chessboard color though.

From now \"Gallery Frihamnstorget\" will be a regular and growing part of this.*\n\n## We believe that there should and can be different spaces for art. A space that is accessible, that is open, that gives you freedom and responsibility and helps a diverse range of artists and works to develop.\n\n**At the same time, Frihamnstorget gallery will pursue and grow collaborations with other more classical artspaces, to widen the reach for both sides. We want to open up towards and invite more people interested in culture and art into our community who might not know us yet and we want to build bridges for the creators and artists of our community.**\n\n\n## The Yellow Container of Gallery Frihamnstorget is available to selected artists for free for a calendar month at a time. Artists are selected based on their proposed exhibitions.\n\nThe selection is made by the Gallery Frihamnstorget board from the [proposals submitted](https://dreams.blivande.com/gallery) on this platform as well as through direct invitation.\n\nWe provide the exhibition space, electricity and some access to facilities at House Blivande for free for a month at a time. For the first year we do not take any provisions from art or ticket sales the artist makes connected to the gallery.\n\nExhibiting at Gallery Frihamnstorget comes with certain responsibilities for the exhibiting artist. You can find a more detailed list in the guidelines but the most important points to be aware of from the start are as follows:\n\n1. You need to plan and promote an opening event for your exhibition and make the exhibition accessible for the public for at least 7 days during the your residency. Frihamnstorget and Blivande can use our social media channels to push your promotions and provide you with suggestions, but you must be prepared to invest your own time and budget to plan your events and generate promotional material.\n2. Frihamnstorget and Blivande will not take responsibility for damages. Any insurance for the exhibited art pieces has to be covered by the artist.\n3. The gallery container can not be changed in ways that cannot be restored. This includes painting and drilling. You must return the space as you received it on the last day of the calendar month. Fixtures can be made with magnets or through welding if discussed first with the Gallery Frihamnstorget board.\n\nBy exhibiting in Frihamnstorget Gallery you accept these rules ([and the more detailed list in the guidelines](https://dreams.blivande.com/gallery/about)).\n\nWe are looking forward to you and your art in this wonderful space!\n\n## Steps to apply\n\n* Sign up on the [dream platform](https://dreams.blivande.com/gallery)\n* Read the [guidelines](https://dreams.blivande.com/gallery/about) \n* Create your proposal. \n* Either publish it to get others excited about the idea or keep it unpublished so only you and the reference group can see it. You can continue working on it even after you post it as we understand dreams always as WIP.\n* Open call period: 19th of October - 23rd of November\n* We will get in touch and announce the selection for the first quarter of 2021 in the first week of December.\n\n*You can check out Gallery Frihamsntorget on Instagram @gallerifrihamnstorget:* https://www.instagram.com/gallerifrihamnstorget/", "created_at": "2020-10-19 09:52:34.356275", "updated_at": "2020-10-19 11:56:38.203608", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 557, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 483.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2973, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 604, "post_number": 33, "raw": "[quote=\"jakobskote, post:29, topic:604\"]\nThe container-moving truck isn\u2019t a very finetuned machine, unfortunately\n[/quote]\n\nThey can be, it's really up to the operator, as with most things. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-02-27 23:03:27.800115", "updated_at": "2020-02-27 23:03:27.800115", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [2947], "is_reply_to": [2947], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 649, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 24, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[quote=\"fjallstrom, post:8, topic:24\"]\njust thought i\u2019d let you guys know that the \u201cin our forums\u201d-link on [www.blivande.com ](http://www.blivande.com) homepage points to a 404 or edgeryders. should probably link to [forum.blivande.com](http://forum.blivande.com)\n[/quote]\n\nThanks!

It would land somewhere between 750-1500 SEK depending on how much work you will be doing yourselves. It has so far never happened that we didn't have to do our own cleaning after an event, regardless of what the organizers stated beforehand. So we just go for our own mandatory cleaning fee, even if it might frustrate the 1% that actually would have cleaned properly.\n\nMy recommendation to you would be that you rent two rooms, and that we would give you a discount on the second room, paying 7500 KSEK for both excluding cleaning costs. This in order to have one strictly ceremonial room and a social lounge room with refreshments where you start the event. \n\nBut we're open to negotiation of course.
