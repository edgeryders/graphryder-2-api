I know of myself, that I would claim to fall under the category \"people of Blivande\". You might be just as sure to claim your title. Generally, it is all of us who build and fix, plan and think, connect and care for Blivande and its fluctuating population. A rough estimate is 40 people.\n\n### Why the retreat?\n\nThis is my list of things, I would like to do with \"the people of Blivande\", in a retreat by the forest for  3-4 days. \n\n**Vision Sharing and Holding**\n\nBlivande is slowly becoming more and more, with the different opportunities and collaborations coming up, as we establish ourselves in the cultural landscape of Stockholm. It would be nice to have common time for a motivational update of our dear vision thinkers @hampus and @hugi, and others who's gift for vision setting I might be overlooking right now. Take us on a trip to potential future multiverses.\n\n**Microsolidarity**\n\nBlivande has been inspired and simultaneously has inspired the concept of [Microsolidary.](https://www.microsolidarity.cc) It is a great concept, that I think in many ways we have already made our own. Sometimes it nice to put words to existing emerging phenomena. \n\n> **Microsolidarity**  is a set of practices for mutual support between peers. These methods bring us out of individualism and into a more relational way of being. Most of this support happens in a  **Crew** : a small group up to about 8 people growing trust in each other through emotional & economic reciprocity. Crews are always designed for intimacy, and may also produce an output (e.g. a software product or an activist campaign).\n> The  **Congregation**  is a space for Crews to co-develop in the company of other Crews. Congregations have less than a few hundred people, so they can be primarily governed through trust and dialogue.\n\n**Internal Communication and Authentic Relating** \n\nWe see each other **a lot**, mostly busy working on different projects, sometimes on the same. Ideas are exchanged through word of mouth or the forum. Creating a container of dedicated time and space to explore our internal communication, seems tempting to me. I am not talking about the channels, we are constantly optimizing those. I am referring more to how we talk and interact with each other. How we set contexts and make implicit standards of behavior explicit. Authentic Relating has been part of my life for while now and I want to make it part of Blivande. We are constantly in each others professional and private spaces, conflict is unavoidable (and a source of growth and intimacy when transcended).  We can help each other to be honest, aware of our needs and boundaries and compassionate to when we mess up something. This is my as you might anticipate, my biggest personal why for the retreat (next to FUN).\n\n**Creative Opportunity and Open Stage**\n\nI can see the danger of exponential project creation, if you put 40 of us in a cabin by the woods. It would be sane, to have someone checking that we do not forget to enjoy ourselves and relax. Also let's have an open stage, I see it as a place where I get to know and see those of you that I do not know very well both in your essence and in your project and doing around Blivande. I have this dream of giving everyone 5-3 minutes attention, which they can spend to their individual liking. Attention is such a gift. \n\n**FUN**\n\nThe essential ingredient. \n\nFor me it is long conversations, dancing, maybe some LARPing, Walks in the forest and good, heathy food with a lot of carbs. What is it for you?\n\n\n\n### What do you think? \n\nThis is co-created of course. I am motivated to get the ball rolling but would love to have some play partners to throw it around. \n\n**Fell free tagg people of Blivande**", "created_at": "2020-12-13 04:07:12.929712", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 04:15:56.195383", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 709, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 154.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 311, 176, 108, 210, 24], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7563, "user_id": 25, "topic_id": 1351, "post_number": 44, "raw": "they actually didn't charge us for the installation or the unit, \nwe told them that maybe we would spray paint/not cover up the containertjanst logos around the square, then they came did it for free.\nI call it, re-commodification.\n\n[quote=\"hampus, post:38, topic:1351\"]\nContainertj\u00e4nst sells this product and @bobspeakman and @NinaLindberg had one installed from them on the cafe container.

These are strange times indeed. Hampus and I just had a meeting, and decided on the following plan.\n\n1) Production will move out of the open space gradually this week, and move into the unused event spaces. This will happen in steps, as we need to arrange for tables and equipment in those rooms. We promise that from Saturday onward, there will not be production going on in the open space. Starting next week, we want the production to cause less disruption to ordinary Tau activities.\n\n2) If Tau members need access to Beta during this time, that will be arranged. Talk to Hampus to sort that out as needed. We arranged for that with @NinaLindberg and @cecilia_ulfsdotter yesterday. We also encourage cooperation between Tau members to ask to use any spaces that may be vacant at present.\n\n3) PPE production at Blivande at this scale will continue until April 30th, primarily in the Flex/Studio room and in the event spaces. During this time, we want to make sure that it can exist alongside the ordinary activity in Tau. Please talk to @hampus to figure out how to work around any disturbances that might still happen after production leaves the open space, or try to sort out solutions with other Tau-members if you can. If commercial supply of gowns increases a lot before April 30th, we will scale down or stop production earlier.\n\n4) Starting May 1st, we aim to phase out PPE production at Blivande, perhaps continuing at a lower intensity with a single team. If there is still large unmet demand, we will refocus on helping others set up production in other spaces in Sweden and abroad, as is already happening in Farsta.\n\nToday and in the coming days we might have journalists in the house from SVT, Aftonbladet and other media. This initiative is getting a lot of attention, so it\u2019s likely that until we start phasing our production in May there will still be a lot of activity in the house.\n\nLet\u2019s use this thread to further clarify anything that might need to be decided or communicated.

You can for instance share google docs in basecamp and connect your personal calendar. You can also keep several projects going at the same time with no confusion. \nCons: Not necessary user friendly at start. It requires some introduction before it works. Within the projects there can be some confusion. \n\n5. Propose a creative remote social interaction\nTo show a personal item from your home.

During the chat we talked about expectations and responsibilities, and concluded that Foodsharing events could actually happen in your community. I was shown the potential spaces and particularly liked those with direct connection to the outside, both for volunteers and attendants convenience. Besides, it seems that Saturday mornings would work for all of us, providing dates and times are communicated and agreed in advance. One of the key actions for this collaboration to work is the designation of a responsible Foodsharing volunteer, who would be the link between both communities. That person could be sponsored with a Tau membership, and thus would have access to Blivande to facilitate the events\u2019 logistics -apart from having the privilege to enjoy the rest of the membership benefits her/himself. I do believe that if this was agreed the collaboration would count with all the ingredients to be a success. \n\nRegarding the Folkk\u00f6k-events, as @hampus says, they could serve the purpose of bringing both communities together, and introducing new members to the collaboration. We would definitely like to coordinate with the responsible for the cafe/kitchen container and see how to make it happen. Thank you @bobspeakman for providing your contact info. \n\nThis said, I already talked with the rest of core members of Foodsharing Stockholm group, who loved the ideas and positive feedback. However, I would like to organize a viewing/meeting with members from both communities, for them to see what I saw and ask further questions that I might have missed. Would it be possible to invite 3 Foodsharing volunteers over to Blivande to show them the space? We could meet afterwards and perhaps arrange a Zoom meeting with other members who would also like to hear from you. I understand these are delicate times for people to physically meet, so please, just let me know if any concerns. \n\nI created this Doodle for you to vote the date/time that best fits you, and will share it with the Foodsharing members too. Hopefully we will find a good time for everyone in January. \n\nhttps://doodle.com/poll/3rmcpuazscmv9k8c?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link\n\nThanks again for your time into this, very excited to keep working on it! :) \n\nBest, \n\nOlga", "created_at": "2020-12-13 11:16:44.117147", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 11:16:44.117147", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 421, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 71.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 176], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5434, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 601, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Add it to Dreams to we can have the overview of what is planned! :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-06-15 16:17:41.445419", "updated_at": "2020-06-15 16:17:50.790602", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 17.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [5425], "is_liked_by": [15], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1632, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 405, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Ping @hampus, @Linnea, @jakobskote, @Frida_Simon, @elch, @spargeltarzan, @MariaMartin, @Ollxor, @Thedodod", "created_at": "2019-10-17 22:34:06.900358", "updated_at": "2019-10-17 22:34:58.337468", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 16.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5374, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1026, "post_number": 21, "raw": "We are setting up a nice graphic design work is play studio this friday in the upper secret experience container which is now well equipped with wifi, so you could come and set up shop there on Friday :)", "created_at": "2020-06-11 08:59:49.057926", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 08:59:49.057926", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 67.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [23, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8734, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1635, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Really nice to see this come to life! \nDon't hesitate to clear out space in the freezer in the kitchen.

We met with @ubbesen and Olle Bjerk\u00e5s and began very initial discussions on how to arrange the space.\n\nHere's how I left it.\n\n![IMG_8486|375x500](upload://hPkk5LOcIs6j5VOFzpvM8ywOSUf.jpeg) ![IMG_8487|375x500](upload://noaPHd0dWdfzp9TA2Gt0L5C0sCP.jpeg) ![IMG_8485|375x500](upload://nw1c4CL5zVVInFSxKJk0lzxj0d6.jpeg) ![IMG_8489|375x500](upload://65lOaQ0qA8opBtsYQor5MT3gOLR.jpeg) ![IMG_8488|375x500](upload://gat45XejY27wzsrRYKUI50hapt9.jpeg)  \n\nNormally I would never leave anything out in the hall way as this is a sacred space. However, there's just so much stuff in the electronics room that I/we really don't think should be there.\n\n1. Should we set a deadline for when all of this is to be removed from Tau? Objects/materials that should be taken into consideration for the inventory must stay a bit but all else? The 15 or so moving boxes all contained items that I found questionable for the Electronics room\n\n**Can we set a deadline for removal of personal belongings? What would a good amount of time be? 17th of April, 2nd of May?**\n\n2. Instead of moving things from the Electronics room to the \"storage\" room next to it, I think it would be wiser to not just move things around but for items to be removed from Blivande completely. Otherwise we are stuck in a spiral of just moving around moop. And we need to be able to access/understand the purpose of this storage space - for instance we have a lot of \"technical gear\" such as speakers, stands, compressor etc. maybe this space is a good place for that? \"large technical gear\" that should not be in an everyday work environment but still accessible as they are used rarely but still useful.\n\n**Can we agree that the storage space next to the Electronics room is not cluttered anymore, it's currently not possible to even set up the shelves due to the amount of stuff in the way. And that it should not be used as a catch-all storage space for mattresses etc. and set a deadline here as well for pickup - we probably know who owns things?**\n\n3. I also noticed that there's private storage space in the painting area, or shelves with names on it. Perhaps it would be interesting to discuss whether personal storage should even exist in shared rooms. Has there been discussions to ONLY allow for personal storage in 1 room, and for all other rooms to only have general purpose items / shared items? This would mean that personal storage is a bit more secured, and that general purpose space is used for just that.\n\n**Any thoughts on this? Would be fantastic to have some type of code of conduct / policy and implement it from the start. I personally am not a big fan of taking up common space with my items, and since many of us work on \"projects\" from time to time it makes sense I think that project items are not publicly accessible at all times. 1-2 Project Boxes / Personal Storage makes sense to me, for instance if you're a painter and use certain colours but ideally the items should not be stored permanently unless a certain financial deal is struck (storage space should cost a bit extra).**\n\n---\n\nFor next steps we would like to meet soon again, but in order to do a proper inventory and seriously consider the space as a professional and inviting area we have to be able to physicaly move in the room. I understand that we all stored a lot at Stugan (Svartljus as well) and Blivande runs the risk of being a \"permanent\" \"temporary\" storage space which I think would make it extremely difficult for us to get new members excited.", "created_at": "2019-04-03 09:32:26.081549", "updated_at": "2019-04-03 09:32:26.081549", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 637, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 70.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5426, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1125, "post_number": 14, "raw": "## **\u00a7 2 Restricted items - stuff we do not currently fund without exception.**\n\n* Alcohol\n* Illegal stuff\n* Fireworks\n* Drones\n* No Festival Tickets\n* Remuneration and hired labour (put a cap on it, only for specialised skills connected to safety and legal issues, see salaries)\n* Personal Transport (discussion point)\n\nDon\u2019t budget for these items, you will not get reimbursed.", "created_at": "2020-06-15 15:24:40.910367", "updated_at": "2020-06-15 15:32:03.171697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 55, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6709, "user_id": 15, "topic_id": 1327, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Ok so next question @hugi @hampus @elch @Alex.Colard    - What type of organic? \n\nLike true nature/generative like so? \n![image|690x495](upload://dVK6jtkGIdxwXDLHZZeAC1w6PXB.jpeg) \n![image|281x500](upload://3y1grKYaOeX28hyK7EGrVM9KPjg.jpeg) \nOr organic swirly like so?

Mostly tickets sales go under customer rules and give the \u201ccustomer\u201d the right to cancel sale in 14 days or get money back if \u201cevent\u201d is cancelled. An other is that founds often get tied up in an ticket organisation and are not available until after an event and after the event has really \u201chappened\u201d Usually that is a good thing for many commercial applications but it is not optimised for our type of organisation or service. \nReasons being that founds for eg dreams etc must come in before the event, also as being a membership event or similar still a cancelled event needs to cover costs usually in co-created events there is no big \u201cbooking or event company\u201d that can take the hit. At the same time during this hard crisis it is difficult to trust an ticket company and have huge amounts of founds tied up in an organisation that might go bankrupt and you will never get your ticket proceeds.\n\nGenerally regarding the legal issues most organisation that want to sell tickets and be sure they get their proceeds cal the ticket a membership that starts the same time as the buyer gets the ticket. In that way founds can be funnelled directly towards dreams etc. \nBurnertickets moonclerc Billetto etc and many solutions exist each one with good sides and bad ones.\n\nI think at some point we will need a more advanced and specialised solution. There is a huge craving for this, organisations like the node, festivals in frihamstorget events in blivande workshops etc are asking for this constantly. \nThe node has developed an app for checking memberships and so on.

The visitor becomes another element in the installation who decides  when and how things should happen by touching a number of different objects present in the room.\n\nThis past week I linked a Makey Makey to the program Resolume, and made simple visuals and sounds that are affected when touching two different objects ( a spoon and a pin).\n\n![DSC_5424|690x460](upload://cFdunU84JN3c4HWcUvyYGNUJRYk.jpeg) \n![DSC_5425|690x460](upload://jDdGysOuKP8DnQfZpUMS7ZeG0LB.jpeg) \n\n**VICTORIA**\n\n***\"Pixelstick\"***\n\nHave you ever heard about light painting? You draw with a light source in the air and catch it with your camera in long exposure mode. Basically this is what my current project is about - but different and if everything is going well it will be possible to create an animation instead of a still picture. After watching a video of Philippe Dubost ([\"It's going to be okey!\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAUuMzgYA8U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAUuMzgYA8U)) I got inspired to re-creating the technique and tool with materials I found here at Blivande. During the past week I focused on developing this light painting technique by creating less abstract but more pixel-based pictures. This is possible with a  stick which can create a picture pixel by pixel. The stick is made of a LED strip, a Teensy, two power banks and cardboard. It needed some coding (a big learning milestone for me) and some adjustments during the week to make it work. And on Friday I had my first prototype:\n\n![28|690x460,100%](upload://hNjhovYGk5OBtWgmP5TcHqIv3Kx.png) \n![93959441_232395577854809_55694236791603200_n|375x500](upload://qIBeu28Av7v8iuycoq29uOYcXbn.jpeg) \n![LPL-Mercury_2020-04-17_18-30-18|690x388,100%](upload://l5I1LJhr64QSnHvBQmCmTPTIblo.png) \n\n**CLEAS**\n\nTLDR;\n\n1. To inspire myself and others about life\n2. Demonstrate the ability a 3D physical object has to communicate the potential of power or mystery.  \n\nwhat\n\n1. in wanting to inspire myself and others about life, I have chosen to remind us that when something is appealing to us, when we try to obtain or control that, the appeal eventually dissappears. Like with life. If we chose to see whats there, let it appear and let ourselves admire it, life makes sense. But as soon as we want to obtain more moments of fun, and take control, instead of just observing when they appear and appreciate, thats when life doesnt make sense. For example we can chose to want more and more of life and get sad about the day we are going to die, or we can choose to see that life as something that has been given to us. Just notice it. In front of us. And appreciate it. \n2. in demonstrating the ability for a 3d physical object to communicate the potential of power or mystery; i have chosen to focus on the moment of indulgence. This installatiuon attempts to bring the idea of harmony in to the moment of indulgence: \n\n\"As a very visual person I find myself searching for a visual place place to direct my senses during a moment of indulgence. I find that the visual component of an experience is ultimately where the expression is manifested. Like a vintage car driving down the road, roaring, or the flower gracufully wabbling in a mild breeze or a singer, or dj in front of a live music expereince, all become the object in which a sensation experience is manifested. I want to to create a object to illustrate how powerful this concept is.  I want to create a moment of indulgence and place a physical object that the current feeling of indugence can be directed towards. This object is an object of indulgence in the same way that breeathing becomes an object of meditation.\"\n\nThe ideal object of indulgence for me is to create something that is equally stimulating, soothing whilst piquing curiosity to continuously draw the observer towards this object. Creating an appealing shape radiating light will stir enigma enigmatic shape that questions the potential powers or meaning of a physical shape will do this job.  To me the physical pbject is \n\nI've also chosen to use an object as opposed to a plane because historically, everything in our universe that possesses some kind of power is 3dimensional. Hence by using spatiality or 3D space, we can indicate a sense of potential power or ability.\n\nLast week we prototyped some of the technology and methods we will be using for the installation, eg. light, diffusion etc. Here are some pictures from that prototype:\n\n![93711476_936200586814679_1721874074256277504_n|690x388](upload://n1EmyYshCt1PZ6iB5Cs6KoEcEBm.jpeg) ![93975693_228608438351941_1364082738491031552_n|690x460](upload://iK7dTxxRMQXEMaXiMsw2wmiwwhn.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-04-21 10:01:32.909057", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 11:45:09.158558", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 949, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 212.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [13, 4, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4798, "user_id": 15, "topic_id": 1026, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I love the 3D one on the left and the hanging one - very fun and visual, can be simplified easily- imo the bottom one is a bit too much like a artsy architecture firm/logo doesnt say so much about \"us\", right/middle isnt' easily readable.

Both sides were interested in so and also to try to get more local cultural players like maybe Magasin 3 on board.\n\n**The points were we aligned especially well were:**\n\n1. Gallery Firhamnstorget committed approach to transparency in the application and selection process which enables artists to learn from each other's experiences.\n2. Learning in general as a goal, which connects also to initiatives we are planning around  Frihamnstorget to do creative workshops in [Blivande Akademi](http://forum.blivande.com/t/blivande-akademie-making-it-happen/1500) and WIP for example and which is a topic close to Deborah Duerr's heart.\n3. Connecting, activating and creatively revitalising the local area.\n\n\n*Deborah Duerr, agreed to join our forum to discuss this here with us and I am delighted to welcome her!*\nWe are happy to develop this with you here in co-creation and transparency.\n\n## Here a list of some initial collaboration ideas to serve as a basis on which to discuss and develop further ideas:\n\n1. We would like to invite Deborah Duerr form Gallery Duerr to join us for the selection session for the spring terms exhibition program. We would be happy for her input and experience and she can surely find some interesting unconventional new artists. We want to set up these sessions as social gatherings in which different people can join the discussion. However, given the current Covid restrictions situation, this first session will most likely be an online session. (However, we will try to fill it with as much charm, music, art and coffee as possible in that format).\n\n2. We could coordinate the dates of exhibition openings so that interested public could either experience vernissages in one day/weekend or that we do not interfere with each other in events which might not profit from that. Programs for such coordinated openings could be sent to local newspapers.\n\n3. Coordinate topically. We could potentially discuss a topic for a joined open call for a bigger topical joint exhibition. Such a call could take place for example after the current round for example for May or June. A live stream/video projections could also be used to connect the locations during such share topical exhibition.\n\n4. We could display posters and flyers with each other's programmes in each other's locations. \n\n5. The outside space of Gallery Frihamnstorget enables events and larger public openings. We could maybe look at getting some of the local galleries together for a small art festival in summer. Live music and food at Frihamnstorget plats could open up high art events to the neighbourhood, exhibitions in more Galleries could give more cultural weight to such events.\n\n\n\n\n*There are of course already shared events that draw attention to the Stockholm art scene, such as Stockholm art week. (And I would like to ask those of the readers who are more knowledgeable with these initiatives than me( I am still a bit new to Stockholm) to list some below. Coordinating a bit for those will also be good.) However, we think that starting dedicated collaborations and communication between local cultural actors will help all of us to make this area more alive, even nicer, more open, realise it's potential and gets through a hard time for the cultural and creative fields together.* \n\nThis thread is supposed to be the start of a discussion to work out the details of collaborations with Gallery Frihamnstorget. \n\n### Everyone is invited to give their ideas and feedback and this post will be updated accordingly.", "created_at": "2020-11-19 15:42:44.802396", "updated_at": "2020-11-19 15:48:06.675810", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 800, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 87.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 183], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8559, "user_id": 109, "topic_id": 1344, "post_number": 58, "raw": "AH, I was asleep.

I'll get rid of the black glue, perhaps it was due to its properties (dunno).\n\n3. I labeled all the little plastic bags inside the boxes, ie. USB-boxes are labeled and also LED-strips-bags. \n\n4. We are moving out the LED-plastic tubes in August making an install with @annielocke, so that shelf should be free'd up.\n\n5. I moved out the LCD-screen and the bag of mobile phones @Gravklot. Please inquire in the forum if there is a need before gifting it. In our case, we have SO much stuff, that what we need is to make use of the materials at Blivande, rather than to add more to it.\n\nThere is no official guideline regarding gifting, but here's my take.\n\nGifting is a dialogue. Giving something, without expecting compensation, is a beautiful act. So, thank you for doing that. I do believe however that there should be an immediate receiver in the other end, or, that the gift is provided in such a way that it finds an immediate place / there is an immediate need.\n\nWithout this in mind, we quickly get boxes that just say \"random stuff\", with no one taking responsibility for the material inside. Even more often, members leave, and they also leave their gifts, turning a positive act into a burden for the members.\n\nI left your items in the corridor with your name on it, so you can decide what to do with them. I encourage you to ask in the forum if someone has an interest, otherwise consider keeping it at home, or disposing of if.\n\nAre there ever exceptions to this? Of course. We have a bunch of boxes, one that just says USB. Is there an immediate need for 50 USB cables? Hell no. But it's a very common thing, and a very relevant place within the room. It's a gray area, so - let's talk about the things you wish to give to the space. There's for instance a box with only motors, if you feel like taking out the vibration motor of all the phones, then by all means, there's a place for it :D\n\n6. Someone left a white metal hollow box that I simply put in the corridor as well. Perhaps it's yours @Ollxor? I already asked Bj\u00f6rn :) Either way, if not taken, I'll dispose of it as I return from the forest festival. \n\n//\n\nIn case it is not apparent I **really** struggle with \"messy\" spaces. And a mess can be fine if contained in a box, and neatly tucked away, with the intention to sort it. Stugan was a nightmare for me. I dreaded every moment being there, and I am SO HAPPY to not be there anymore.\n\nPlease, build stuff, make projects - or at the very least, store your stuff in a way that it does not prevent others from feeling calm while working.\n\n7. We are going to the Forest festival tomorrow and bringing our stuff from the Flex room along with plastic tubes FYI. See you in 10 days!\n\n//\n\nAlso, sorry for putting stuff in the corridor, it is not the place, but damnit the \"storage room\" got messy again - what . the . fuck . happened . there.", "created_at": "2020-08-02 17:25:06.819270", "updated_at": "2020-08-02 17:32:37.588241", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 587, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 128.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 67, 16, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4585, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 986, "post_number": 4, "raw": "from chat with @jakobskote on the 6th of May:  \n> \"It is a tool exploration to create a digital infrastructure for emergent decentralised co-created projects.\n> \n> we try to see if the tools from the burner community can fit in the \"more normal\" social context.

The shapes of things that are designed today are the result of years of tradition. Yes but what would happen if we try and rebel against those traditions. What happens if we design new things - differently inviting us to engage with them differently? Will we realize that the design we are creating for ourselves is extremely static and formal and in fact not very, *human*. \n\nFurniture inspired by moments of indulgence. When we are kids the world around is shaped to be playful. But as we grow older we increasingly stagnate into excpectations on eachother. We either sit, stand or lay flat. What if we created furniture that would invite us to engage with it in a different way. \n\nConcept\n\n![IMG_9832|690x309](upload://pGrA2kznutrRBryTlflFE15WNk2.jpeg) \n![IMG_9831|402x499](upload://kthSEBUYRtXhWH6gsyQSdanlbpG.jpeg) \n\n**VICTORIA**\n\nThe Text Type Light Project is still on going, just got on pause for a week. We are so lucky to have such supportive people here at Blivande like Teo who is willing to lend us his car to give us so much more flexibility for our filming. And thank you for joining us the other night. Always more fun with more people :) \n\nWeek 06 started with adjusting some issues we had the week before where we started to film here at Frihamstorget and got literally stuck here. The light wasn't showing as we wanted. The computer we build in basically crashed all the time we played text/typography with a big amount of white pixels. We figured out the problem by an elimination process. So Tuesday, Jonas spend time to adjust the stick even more by adding 4 buttons for having the possibility of scrolling trough the files we have on the build-in mini SD card. With this option we don't have to restart by pulling out the USB cable everytime we want to start over.\n\n![IMG_4511%20copy|374x499](upload://nYwSXlau5LPBBbD00cMQZ7GQwHt.jpeg) \n\nOn Tuesday evening, this week, we will go out again to film more of the submissions we got.\n\nAlso for me it was time to think about a new project i want to spend my time on. \nOne idea is to work with Blivandes display window at G\u00e4rdets subway station. It will probably be something with a tool called \"AxiDraw\" -  a machine who can draw any geometric form as long as it is a vector shape with any pen you like. It prints visuals on any surface with any drawing tool you want. [See how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5492ZjivAQ0). I will try to connect it with a sensor probably to make it even interactive. \n\n![1_3|666x500](upload://jrSXDIMBsnWsvNFimx8fz3utoS8.jpeg) ![Spongenuity-samer-dabra-cmyk-line-portraits-axidraw|690x457](upload://unhix51PZLnCBJ8o64Fjy9MhK6y.jpeg) \n![precise-writing-drawing-machine-robot-axidraw-fb-1%20(1)|690x362](upload://mJypDtzKc3coMUylVNNM78PDrvJ.png) \n\n**SUSANNA**\n\nRight now I'm experimenting with the arduino and Touchdesigner. At this point, I can light up a LED-pin and change color in Touchdesigner. It\u2019s maybe one small step for humanity, but a big step for me! Thinking that I want to create a mini light show when I can do more stuff than just change color, in like a shoe box or something.

Creators that have been around for a long time feel entitled to more resources, and they also are, in a sense, as the key people are necessary for the project to work. At the same time this can deter new members and create a sour process.

If it\u2019s off it\u2019s just a min budget option, and the dreamer cannot be allocated more money than they seek. We will go with this last option for Frihamnstorgsfestivalen.\n\nIn the future we will implement flags for budget depending on if they meet the guidelines or not.

The only thing I am really looking for is the kind of accountability, that taking a course makes you develop towards the teacher and the group.\n\nThus, I decided to take action and lead a **Co-created Advanced Swedish Course**.\nDue to Corona and to have maximal flexibility the course will be online.\n\n**This course is directed for those that can already understand and speak a lot of Swedish and wish to get to a higher level of proficiency**\n\nI recommend you to have at least B1 if not B2/C1/C2.\n\n\nI have opted for the following format:\n\n1. Every second Wednesday (1,3): Online Meet-Up and discussion about a specific topic, political question, philosophy question. Something that challenges us out of our linguistic comfort zone of every day life conversations. The question will be set the week before so that we have time to think about it. We will use the Noden Zoom account for this (Duration 2h)\n\n2. Every other second Wednesday (2,4): Submission of a written text 500-1000 words in the forum regarding an assay or short story we read together to learn to express opinion in written form. We can help each other by reading one assay of one other member of the group. The text is going to be announced before. Here, we could ask more help from the community and native speakers to correct.\n\n3. Suggested  2x 1,5 additional individual study time per week, meaning reading books, learning vocabulary  and even viewing and reviewing movies. This is done by everyone alone. I am going to take this very seriously personally because I really want to improve my skills and encourage you to do it to. \n\n### I want to have a start up meeting (1h in Zoom) to pick the first short story and question for the discussion, then get started:\n\n## **Tuesday 24.11.2020 20:00**\n\nThis course is an invitation to you to join me on a journey that I will be doing anyways, so there is no incentive for me to be strict or running behind anyone that might want to join. It is also ok to join for a period. I think there are many of us who's learning curves have stagnated with time and that want to be fluent and eloquent adults in this country we have made our own. \n\n### Last comment!

In general, we want to fund edibles because we believe everything can be art, but it\u2019s not feasible if every damn chill space budgets for fruits and cakes and what not.\n\nIs your dream a wooden sculpture of your own face? (awesome, do this!) Then don\u2019t budget for cake to give out when you open it (instead gift cake bought with your own money.)\n\n**Bad examples:**  Expensive party tent for a one time workshop (find another space to host the workshop).

Should I buy + expense?\n\n3) I'm confused about the sand-paper for the electric sanders (see pictures) -- one seems too small and the holes look to be in the wrong place for the vacuum to work.  The other one looks like it fits but the holes are in the wrong place.  Since the sand paper is from bosch and the sanders are bosch, how could this be?\n\n4) I don't see how to attach the vacuum to the sanders.  Do we have an adapter somewhere? I didn't see it.\n\n5) It's a big PITA to empty the vacuum bag.  How are we doing with ordering more?  Or can we do without them if we're only cutting wood?  Too dangerous to risk?  Right now I'm emptying them myself and inhaling a shit-done of dust, much worse than if we weren't using the bag at all.\n\n6) The manual electric router seems to be missing part # 10 from the attached manual picture.

Ofc there will be some kind of restrictions on how much shelf place each member gets but that is a big long discussion that also involves the general disposal of space. This starts to become a problem as we grow and at some point we all need to accept that we can not spread out as much as before, but at the same time enable space for different projects and make tau a better workplace.\n\nTo keep you updated I have been working past weeks in sorting and clearing the different storage spaces in blivande. Creating more long term practical solutions eg event storage, \u201chouse spear part\u201d storage etc etc (actually big part is getting similar stuff in same places and not spread out in whole of blivande) my plan is that soon Rydbergs will be fully fixed with shelves and special designated spaces for each project/member and the random dumping of material will not be available in that room. There is also a plan of having a designated place that you can put stuff that is up for grabs that will be cleared once in a while. \nAs for the shelfs in flex room they will at some point be moved/removed to enable more art and workspace, we also had a discussion with Cecilia of removal of stainless bench and opening up for more aesthetic and practical solutions.  \nSo blivande (trough me) is taking its part in freeing up space in TAU please help by not \u201cfilling\u201d it up directly and for now restrain from putting things in to Rydebergs as I try to empty it out completely clean it and start from the beginning. Ofc this will take time for me as i work simultaneously in sorting 6 spaces in the house that are storage...\n\nOne more thing if you got things in Rydebergs that is yours please mark it I have found multiple stuff that\u2019s unnamed. If you got stuff that you wish to donate to tau blivande write that!\n\nOfc we will take this step by step i do not expect everyone to be able to clear out and minimise their footprint of stuff, small steps and soon we will be there! \n\nSo:\n1) Get rid of as much you can \n2) pack effective and save space\n3) mark your stuff \n\nWant to help me with the other rooms and sorting?

But it's very possible to make something happen in the already dedicated wardrobe. You could for example mark a segment of the wardrobe with some black tape or the like and make a nice framed sign describing the rules and conditions.\n\nI will say though that this will likely not be a completely maintenance free project as we already have an issue with forgotten clothes remaining in the wardrobe indefinitely. When we had a dedicated Lost and Found-chest at the Node it was constantly full and very rarely did people come back for their stuff (when it's genuinely valuable they call the next day and then pick it up very shortly afterwards). Basically it means clutter and more work for someone in the end, and that someone usually ends up being me or Joannis. If the clothes swapping rack has some minimum threshold in terms of quality of the items then that could be a different story of course!\n\nIf you want to do this it would require a commitment from your part when it comes to regularly clearing out and removing clothes that doesn't find a new owner with some time decided upon time frame. We will also need to have a good way of removing these clothes for weekends when we rent out the spaces to big events as we then need 100% of the wardrobe free (once corona event restrictions are lifted). \n\nHave you considered doing this as a recurring event rather than a permanent passive installation? I think that could work much better as you then get a much bigger variety to choose from and those events tend to be very popular.

The project room is to remain a flexible room used for all kinds of things, including construction. That's a great thing about the photo studio setup: that it's fundamentally a flexible setup allowing for a relatively empty and customisable room. Whatever fixed installations/lights/reflectors there might be will be high up on wall and in the ceiling. The main difference from today is the change of color in the ceiling (from white to grey) and the installation of black curtains along the walls. \n\n[quote=\"Ollxor, post:8, topic:527\"]\nFeels a bit weird that people who are not yet members gets f\u00f6rsta tjing to book the room.

It's been mentioned here on the forum and elsewhere. It's also something that we've been repeating almost like a mantra during guided tours of the spaces as something that will happen \"soon\". Is this the first time you've heard of the idea? \n\nThe addition of the Hur Kan Vi?-channel to the building would only affect the room 1-2 days per month on average and they would be paying for two Beta Flex memberships costing 5000 SEK/month. As a Tau member paying less than 1/5 of that you would still be welcome to book the room in a similar fashion and frequency. So I find your comment about this being weird somewhat uncalled for and unfair. \n\nHugi made the assumption that you would be paying something for the much more long-term booking of the space given that you needed it for an assumed commercial project, hence the positive reception. It wouldn't be sustainable for *anyone* in the house to book the room for several weeks or months without paying for it. As you probably know we need to increase the monthly turnaround of the house in order to become sustainable (we still haven't paid out a single krona in salaries yet). \n\nIt's of course also a matter of making the use of the space cost something in order to incentivize a more time-efficient use of it so that it can remain as available as possible to the different members of the community. We have been able to keep it free and very informal with just a few members using it (for just a couple of days at a time), but that is bound to change as we grow.

We have early access to the 1000 m2 building in the Frihamnen harbour close to central Stockholm. Edgeryders will have a presence in the house, where I will work alongside @brooks and others on the [Participio Development Lab](https://edgeryders.eu/t/participio-development-lab/9108) and other Edgeryders projects. Most of that work will happen on the second floor of the house, in what we call **Studio Beta** \u2013 a participatory workspace for 20 to 30 members. On the first floor, we will have 300 m2 of art workshop and maker space with large cutting tables, a laser cutter, a CNC-machine, woodworking equipment and a large format printer. Artists, designers and makers can become members of this space we call **Studio Tau**, which is also available to all members of Studio Beta. Finally, our community centre [Noden](https://www.noden.community/) will live on at Blivande and be the beating heart of the house. All photos of from last night are from the Node rooms of Blivande, which will also be an event space for workshops, concerts, seminars, conferences and parties.\n\nThis will be a home for Edgeryders in Stockholm, and once we open I'll make sure all relevant information is available on how to come and work at Studio Beta while doing Edgeryders stuff.\n\nIn the coming months, a lot of work will go into getting the second floor ready for the first members of Studio Beta who will start working there in January. We have two architects working on the floor plan and concept and will start building and refurbishing in November. \n\n## Studio Beta floor plan (2d. floor of the Blivande House)\n<img src=\"http://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7a1cefd8eb43beab732350ac393a9bf3cee8d0fb.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\">\n\nToday I've been working from the still empty but beautiful rooms on the first floor.

Now that we are running for over a year I would like to ask some of you if you have the time to reflect back on the plans and different states of the textile room, the estimates and plans that were made etc\u2026\n\nFor example, what types of projects has the room mostly been used to at this point?\nHow are the different machines used?\nDo we have all the inductions needed to use the more professional embroidery machine? Could we maybe use it for a workshop during the [Blivande Akademie](https://forum.blivande.com/t/blivande-akademie-finding-the-masters/1268) week in combination with some illustrator svg generation training? (@annielocke?)\n[/quote]\n\n@hanakin, @Linnea and @MariaMartin have been the most frequent users of the room so far in different time periods spread out over the year AFAIK. They can answer the question better than I can, but awaiting their input I would say that the room mostly has been used for smaller projects/personal stuff involving curtains and clothing. The exception being Hanakin's art project that was supposed to be installed in a container but which I now think (?) is put on ice/postponed indefinitely, at least as an FT-specific installation.\n\n* You can absolutely use the room for a Blivande Academy workshop!\n\n* The embroidery machine has been somewhat of a failed experiment so far given the large investment cost. It has seen nearly zero usage since its two main champions (Brooks and Anji) ceased to be members soon after its purchase. Brooks was the one with previous knowledge about the machine and it's not the most user friendly device given how old it is with outdated user interface and software (my impression). \n  *  But if someone could take it on as a project and master it I'm sure we can still make something good come out of it!\n\n* Currently there's an power supply issue for the professional sewing machine. This after the 16A power outlet was moved to another room. We're looking at fixing this ASAP and it's a job that involves @Joannis-Magnus. Hopefully we can fix it without buying another expensive outlet spare part (to replace one that broke during re-installation).", "created_at": "2020-08-13 14:01:54.569371", "updated_at": "2020-08-13 14:01:54.569371", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 394, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 52.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [6061], "is_reply_to": [6061], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 785, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 45, "post_number": 84, "raw": "Ladies, gentlemen, beings. \n@Jan_vL if you are around and feel like hanging out?

The Husqvarna can cover the embroidery and quilting functions. \n It is also a very decent sewing machine.\n The cons of a multi-function advanced machine is of course debatable ease of usability for beginners, complexity, servicability. Also despite claims that it can sew through anything and everything I would still invest in a second machine that has been very specifically designed for more heavy duty work. \n\nConstruction/Sewing: \n   Sewing fabrics together, garments, etc.\n  Here we need a good, heavy duty semi industrial that will withstand the bashings of multiple projects and use by both professionals and beginners. An investment, much as the Husqvarna is an investment. \n Juki TL-2000Qi seems to fit the bill.\n However, due to the current budget restrictions, I do think we should get the Husqvarna and then purchase a Singer 4452 for example, which is only about 3K SEK compared to us long term aiming for a machine that is usually in the range of 10-15K SEK. \n I read some reviews, read them until they were oozing out of my ear canals, and everyone is rather pleased by this Singer 4452.\nAlso I still think it\u2019s a good investment.

Lee*, Amy C. Edmondson 2017\n[Link to paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319550780_Self-managing_organizations_Exploring_the_limits_of_less-hierarchical_organizing)\n\nThis paper gives a good overview over existing literature, and is a great starting point for explorations of this topic. \n\n**Abstract:** Fascination with organizations that eschew the conventional managerial hierarchy and instead radically decentralize authority has been longstanding, albeit at the margins of scholarly and practitioner attention. Recently, however, organizational experiments in radical decentralization have gained mainstream consideration, giving rise to a need for new theory and new research. This paper reviews the literature on less-hierarchical organizing and identifies three categories of research: post-bureaucratic organizations, humanistic management and organizational democracy. Despite this extensive prior work, scholarly understanding of radical decentralization remains limited. Using the term self- managing organizations to capture efforts that radically decentralize authority in a formal and systematic way throughout the organization, we set forth a research agenda to better understand less-hierarchical organizing at its limits.\n\n### **Enabling Creative Chaos: The Organization Behind the Burning Man Event**\nKatherine Chen, 2009\n[Couldn't find a link to the book online](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo6797144.html), but I'm sure you can find it [somewhere](https://aaaaarg.fail/)\n\nProbably the most extensive organizational ethnography made on Burning Man, the event that The Borderland is born from. There are several interesting research projects around The Borderland itself, but unfortunately, not anything that is published yet.\n\n### **Digital economy and the rise of open cooperativism: the case of the Enspiral Network**\nAlex Pazaitis, Vasilis Kostakis, Michel Bauwens, 2017\n[Link to pdf](http://www.p2plab.gr/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pazaitis_et_al_2017.pdf)\n\nEnspiral is a very interesting organisation, \"the cutting edge of experimentation in participatory organising.\" This study dives deep into their inner workings, and the effects.\n\n**Abstract:** This article explores how autonomous workers/contributors, involved in peer-to-peer relations, can organise their productive efforts so that they have sustainable livelihoods. The discussion is guided by the concept of \u2018open cooperativism\u2019, which argues for a synergy between the commons-based peer production movement and elements of the cooperative and solidarity economy movements. To this end, we review the case of Enspiral, a network of professionals and companies that empowers and supports social entrepreneurship. We explore its values, operation and governance as well as the chosen strategies for autonomy and sustainability. Finally, some lessons are summarised for the cooperative and union movement, which point to open cooperativism as an integrated vision.\n\n### **The Riddle of Heterarchy: Power Transitions in Cross-Functional Teams**\nFederico Aime, Stephen Humphrey, D. Scott DeRue, Jeffrey B. Paul, 2013\n[Link to pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bd27/524b4f174a73f8e0596545d7e20a7803725f.pdf)\n\nAn interesting analysis of how fluid and easily shifted power structures benefit a team's performance. This kind of fluid hierarchy is exactly what Plato Ideas and Plato Realities attempt to make possible. \n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we develop the concept of a power heterarchy, which is a conceptualization of power structures in groups that is more dynamic and fluid than traditional hierarchical structures. Through a study of 516 directional dyads in 45 teams, we demonstrate that heterarchical structures in which the expression of power actively shifts among team members to align team member capabilities with dynamic situational demands can enhance team creativity. Our results indicate that this positive effect of power heterarchies on team creativity is contingent on the team perceiving the shifts in interpersonal power expressions as legitimate. We discuss the implications of this heterarchical power structure for research on group functioning, power, and legitimacy in organizations.\n\n### **Why and When Hierarchy Impacts Team Effectiveness: A Meta-Analytic Integration**\nLindred L. Greer*, Bart A. de Jong, Maartje E. Schouten, Jennifer Dannals, 2018\n[Link to paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322703266_Why_and_When_Hierarchy_Impacts_Team_Effectiveness_A_Meta-Analytic_Integration)\n\nA quite data-driven study showing that hierarchy generally slightly hurts a team. \n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchy has the potential to both benefit and harm team effectiveness. In this article, we meta-analytically investigate different explanations for why and when hierarchy helps or hurts team effectiveness, drawing on results from 54 prior studies (N = 13,914 teams). Our findings show that, on net, hierarchy negatively impacts team effectiveness (performance: \u03c1 = \u2212.08; viability: \u03c1 = \u2212.11), and that this effect is mediated by increased conflict-enabling states. Additionally, we show that the negative relationship between hierarchy and team performance is exacerbated by aspects of the team structure (i.e., membership instability, skill differentiation) and the hierarchy itself (i.e., mutability), which make hierarchical teams prone to conflict. The predictions regarding the positive effect of hierarchy on team performance as mediated by coordination-enabling processes, and the moderating roles of several aspects of team tasks (i.e., interdependence, complexity) and the hierarchy (i.e., form) were not supported, with the exception that task ambiguity enhanced the positive effects of hierarchy. Given that our findings largely support dysfunctional views on hierarchy, future research is needed to understand when and why hierarchy may be more likely to live up to its purported functional benefits.\n\n### **Why Managers Still Matter**\nNicolai J. Foss, Peter G. Klein, 2014\n[Link to paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279332916_Why_Managers_Still_Matter)\n\nA counterweight to the previous papers, a thoughtful critique of the over-reliance and hype of decentralized decisionmaking, stating the need for traditional hierarchies in many organizational situations. At both Blivande and The Borderland, we strongly believe in hierarchical decisionmaking in some situations and complete decentralization in others. No solution is a one-size-fits-all, but instead needs to be carefully adapted to its context.\n\n### **Resources for decentralised organising**\n[Link to resources](https://hackmd.io/@yHk1snI9T9SNpiFu2o17oA/Skh_dXNbE?type=view)\nTo finish off, here is a list of resources for decentralized organizing, compiled by my friend \n[Richard Bartlett](http://richdecibels.com/), an expert on the topic who works with Enspiral.\n\n@Stadsutveckling_SU @ragnarl", "created_at": "2020-10-05 20:23:16.481440", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 20:30:07.172634", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1052, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 57.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8881, "user_id": 415, "topic_id": 102, "post_number": 46, "raw": "Hello\nIm a new member.\nI have been visiting frihamnen a couple of times and fell in love with it and the idea and community.\nI want to contribute by letting people see how easy it can be to restore an old car or to work with a car and an engine and gearbox etc.\nI have taken some time to see different places in the world and a roadtrip from stockholm down thrue africa in my Land Rover Defender and sailing over the atlantic and going with a moped thrue vietnam.

The challenge there if of course mounting on so high in a safe way without a skylift. The inside would be easier of course given the roof of the yellow container. \n\nAn interesting combo with this (*if* technically feasible as it relies on the sturdiness of the 3D printed mounts etc.) would be to use the tubes as a background complemented by the new Frihamnstorget sign in front of them. That way the programming of the tubes can complement the programming of the lights on the sign itself. It could also just look weird, but it's an idea. \n\nIn general this would give the square a big upgrade in visibility given that the top container is so visible also over surrounding rooftops. \n\nWhen it comes to easier places where to mount it my vote would go towards the already suggested orange container (level 2) facing either inside or outside *OR* the Amandus side of Beckmans (but then the current painting there will limit what programming looks good and not).

It is a democratic, non-profit movement fighting food waste by working to bridge the gap between retailers and consumers that leads to food waste. I am starting this thread as we would like to initiate a collaboration with you.\nIn a nutshell, we would like to ask you for the following:\n-\tAn open space where we could spend around 3 hours for distributing the \u2018rescued food\u2019 once per week, preferably Saturday mornings (flexible schedule). We do not need a kitchen in this space, just a couple of tables and a plug to potentially use a fridge (that we already have). \n-\tAccess to Frihamnstorget kitchen to organize folkk\u00f6k events once/twice per month (great flexibility for dates/times). \n\nAt the moment we rely on one distribution point for the \u2018rescued food\u2019, Kulturhuset Cyklopen, in H\u00f6gdalen. However, our goal is to reach as much people as possible, and we have observed that this location is very restrictive, both for Foodsharing \u2018users\u2019 and volunteers, who would spend a long time just to get to the distribution point, and depend on a car to carry the food all the way there. Besides, we only have access to this Kulturhuset on Friday evenings, which has a negative impact in the popularity of the distributions. \nYour space looks like the ideal spot for Foodsharing Stockholm to expand and become a big part of the food waste fight, as it is in other European cities. We also believe in the importance of raising awareness about this matter and that is why we occasionally organise folkk\u00f6k (folk kitchen) events where we create dinners using surplus food. This is an experiment in improvisation and saving good food from going to waste. Blivande and Frihamnstorget would be ideal spaces to organize these events, and let the community know about food waste. \n\nA bit more about us: Foodsharing Stockholm is a relatively new organization, active since 2019. We intend to establish the concept of food sharing in Stockholm, encouraging sharing food which won't be used (e.g. by collecting unsellable products from supermarkets). This way, we raise awareness on the scale of food waste and establish a concrete solution to the problem based on solidarity. We think that everyone and anyone can be involved in saving and sharing food. As of today, we have been able to find stomachs for almost 2 tons of food that were about to go to the bins.\nBut how do we work? Normally, we set partnerships with businesses and organize regular times with them for picking up the food. From the Pickup Point we transport the food to our Distribution Points, where the food is given away to the community. All the logistics involved are arranged by Foodsharing Stockholm volunteers. Our distributions are publicly announced in our social media channels and are\nopen for anyone interested on showing up. \n\nFor more information about the organization, please feel free to visit our website (foodsharingstockholm.noblogs.org) or social media channels (https://www.facebook.com/Foodsharing-Stockholm-107001424001063/, or @foodsharingstockholm).\n\nOur current partners would be happy to share their experiences with us:\nICA Supermarket \u00c5rsta (donor): phone 086025120\nChili & Wok Restaurant (donor): phone 0760824931\nKulturhuset Cyklopen (sharing point): phone 0767119763\nCoop N\u00e4ra Stadion (donor)\nSopk\u00f6ket (donor)\n\nThank you very much for your time on this!

What is perceived as an institutional setting?

Since the Blivande and frihamnstorget community has crucial localised real live meeting and interaction aspects and some key community members as well as event participants are not very inclined to use the forum it would be good to address and find a way of including some of those observations as well.\n**My suggestion:** \"Ethnography corner/ community diary/column corner/ subcategory: I would write a 1-page observation report after bigger events/once per month or so and also ask participants and organisers to submit their descriptions. This way we would digitalise some of the in-person observations, motivate others to comments with more their versions and be able to code it. For organisers or participants of Noden events or similar where I would not be presents we could motivate them to make such writeups because that means that their perspective and need will become documented and stewarded in the planning and research.\n\n5. **When and with what will the workshops start?** @jakobskote would you have time to talk the workshop plans through with me in the next few weeks so I know what happens when and how I can help?

However, the reality is that in many cases this is a barrier many do not take. Do we need the type of discussions like in the TAU Facebook chat on the forum? What exactly would we need to bring over? Are there alternatives like a) easier access to the forum/chat thread like the \"what's up with you?\" on edgeryders campfire? b) would it be possible to work out a way to copy and post some of the stuff from other chat tools into the forum?

I seized the moment to move away some of our materials from the Into the Woods-installation (which will go to Frihamnstorget as circle light pieces) into the next door Storage room which had some space made free. I don't think it should stay there, but at the same time, I don't think our work environment should be storage (as much as possible) - and storage used appropriately for materials/work that has intention (which I would say those pieces do (however, they need to be somewhat discarded as well at some point).\n\n4. The Feng Shui in the electronics room has never been perfect. But I believe the **terrible black office chairs** need to go. Just to test it out, I moved them out. Finally, the room can breath. And these chairs are terrible either way and take up so much space.\n\n5. Yikes we have many different boxes and shelves etc. I moved out the tall white shelf unit outside, I know it's blocking the path which should be made completely clear, but then again, there's a big rug in the way, and it has been for many months. I'd be happy if this closet thing could stay there for a bit.\n\n6. I began sweeping the floor, I didn't have time to finish before I had to take the last boat home (it was also raining, gah). I felt shit leaving it, but there's two black bags and some dust etc. swept close to it. If you have the time and energy, please dispose. There's also the big cardboard boxes from the Sortimo thing I purchased at the entrance.

That collaboration worked well since it was a well welcomed change from just writing your thesis on your own. We had Zoom-meetings with our \u201chandledare\u201d (mentor) both in groups and one by one which worked very well as you learned a lot by hearing the other students\u2019 questions to their mentors. And the one by one was more specific on the different thesis.\n\nPropose 1-3 guidelines for regular check-in culture \n\n1. Have a clear limitation in the aspect of time. This helps everyone involved in the meeting to plan their day and schedule. \n2. Don\u2019t schedule too many check-in meetings during the week to keep a high level of content during the actual meetings.\n3. Have some sort of agenda where everyone gets to pitch in and speak up. Example: What\u2019s your main focus this week? And then have one person in charge of communicating which member of the team who gets to speak up. Also a good way to get an insight of what everyone is working on or if anyone has some spare time to help another teammate out.\n\nPropose 1-3 guidelines for online calls \n\n1. Keeping the camera on in the beginning of the meeting for a quick greeting. This to make sure that everyone is participating.\n2. Keeping the microphone on mute when not speaking to avoid disturbing sounds/noise.\n3. Sending out an agenda for the meeting in advance with directions of who is leading the meeting and the guidelines/rules so that everyone has the possibility to prepare themselves. This to avoid that the participants all speak at the same time and to make sure that someone is responsible for making sure that everyone's opinions are heard.\n\nPropose 1-3 platforms you would like to use for different types of asynchronous collaboration (pros and cons if possible) \n\n1. Facebook Messenger - for casual chats, smaller questions and information that does not require meetings, sending links. The casual connotations a lot of people have to Messenger could come with negative consequences. People could take a lot of time to answer or don\u2019t recognize what is being sent to them as serious or important. \n2. Zoom - for having group calls, check-ins, seeing each others faces and making quick decisions as well as for having discussions about work. Good to be able to share your screen and get a good overview of e.g. a document. \n3. Google Drive - for keeping documents and notes. It has a simple and understandable interface which makes it easy for a group to collaborate, write together and comment on each others work. The easy editing feature can also be a con, since important information can be removed without checking with workmates.\n\nPropose a creative remote social interaction\n\n1. A quiz where all the participants create a question about themselves that is slightly personal, preferably an amusing fact. By doing this you create a creative remote social interaction at the same time as all the participants get an opportunity to get to know eachother better.  \n2. \u201cGo\u201d to an event together! Museums, lectures, workout sessions, concerts and other events can be enjoyed through Zoom by sharing a screen and watching and discussing together with a group. \n3. Take advantage of the fact that everyone is in their home environment. Maybe do a \u201cshow your favourite piece from home\u201d or that everyone shows the space that they\u2019re working from over perhaps a fika or an aw. \n4. Start every week by everyone in the group sending a personal picture of perhaps something that makes them happy, a cute puppy etc. Could create a positive vibe for the upcoming week!", "created_at": "2020-09-23 13:37:32.004011", "updated_at": "2020-09-23 13:37:32.004011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 661, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 49.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7196, "user_id": 363, "topic_id": 1474, "post_number": 6, "raw": "and yes I would be OK with buying it with a corresponding rent reduction or however to put it :)", "created_at": "2020-09-26 20:13:43.116084", "updated_at": "2020-09-26 20:13:43.116084", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 3.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6727, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1327, "post_number": 26, "raw": "like it but for function it needs to be longer with more bridges. we can push the deadline so @missChief doesn't get distracted with this![IMG_20200909_143253|375x500](upload://spG0tkYqvhzzE7Lw6mm03EDoAha.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-09-09 12:06:11.372207", "updated_at": "2020-09-09 12:35:04.743219", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [305], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7905, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1576, "post_number": 16, "raw": "[quote=\"jonasjohansson, post:13, topic:1576\"]\nI think we tried to not have games that include some kind of colonialism haha\n[/quote]\n\nYes, very important indeed to decolonize classical board games down to the most minute detail. Because we all *know* board games is where it all starts to go wrong and Monopoly is the origin of capitalism.\n\nAlso this is the description of Ethnos:\n\n*\"Ethnos is a mythical realm filled with creatures big and small. As the last Age ended, war and revolt left the inhabitants without someone to lead them into their future. Giants, Dwarves, Elves, and Centaurs have not traditionally gotten along, but a leader is a diplomat as much as a warrior. Now, you\u2019ll have to bring the residents of Ethnos together under one rule. Over the course of three Ages, you will gather followers and convince them to band together to conquer the six Kingdoms. Featuring a classic design by Paolo Mori and breathtaking illustrations by legendary artist John Howe, Ethnos transports you to a world on the brink of disaster. Only a steady hand and a pure heart will be able to lead the inhabitants of Ethnos into the future.\"*\n\nSounds positively fascistoid if you ask me! You're treading on thin ice, my friend. \n\nI mean who ever thinks of the supremely Othered experience of the so called \"Barbarians\" that arrive every so often to steal the Players stacks of resource cards in the board game of Catan? Why even call them \"Barbarians\" to begin with? They are not to blame for the socio-economical contexts that made them into ravenous looters out for blood and resource cards!\nIn defense of Catan I must say though that they have included a seemingly heroic female knight on the front cover.\n\nOn a just slightly more serious note Dead of Winter is probably less PC to be honest (without having played it much). Especially if you play the \"adult\" version (there are different event and action cards depending on player PG-preference). \n\nAaaanyway, you know where to find me. :)", "created_at": "2020-10-21 15:35:23.677717", "updated_at": "2020-10-21 15:35:23.677717", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 68.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [7870], "is_reply_to": [7870], "is_liked_by": [13, 138], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8192, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1571, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Not at all.

The Node is an important community for us, especially when the season turns darker and we long for belonging and experiences with other people. We need to discuss reasonable precautions to limit Covid-19 infections at the Node events.\n\nStopping the spread of infectious diseases completely is not realistic. If two people decides to curl up in a sofa together, and one of them happens to be unknowingly contagious, the other person could catch the bug. If we want to keep the Node open, we need to accept some level of risk, and rely on each individual's responsible behaviour. (WASH YOUR HANDS, ETC ETC)\n\nBut imagine a more extreme situation, where one infected person, with no symptoms, attend an event such as a workshop at the Node, where there's a lot of activities including walking around and interacting with several people, and we learn three days later that 15 people have been infected. This has been known to happen when a lot of people are doing things such as choir singing ([REFERENCE](https://theconversation.com/this-video-shows-just-how-easily-covid-19-could-spread-when-people-sing-together-144789)) or traveling on a bus ([REFERENCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/health/coronavirus-bus-china.html)) and being in close proximity to each other, doing a lot of talking or singing together.\n\nWe need to take our civic responsibility to limit the risk of a massive infection of a lot of people happening, and I propose we come up with some simple guidelines based on scientific facts and recommendations from the authorities.\n\nThe spreading of the Corona virus can happen in multiple ways, but the primary transmission happens through droplets or aerosol through our respiratory system ([REFERENCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/health/coronavirus-bus-china.html)). This means being in close proximity to each other while talking, singing, breathing extensively increases the risk of infectious transmission dramatically. Physical distance is of essence to keep down the risk of a massive infection event and can be the difference of infecting one or two people or infecting 15 people. This difference matter.\n\nWith the current recommendations from the public health agency in Sweden, we are allowed to have up to 50 participants at an event, but given that the rooms at the Node are relatively small we usually keep the limit to less than this. We might need to decrease the number of participants for some events even further, for some workshops to as little as 10 or 15 people in total.\n\nI propose guidelines when planning an event such as these - but please do comment on them so we can figure out a reasonable level for the various kinds of activities we run at Noden:\n\n* It should be able to talk to other people and keep a distance of at least 1 metre (or more?) apart (meaning it can't be too loud in the room)\n* Events with physical exercise, breathing workshops, singing workshops and the like need to keep at least 1, and probably up to 2, metres apart\n* Seminars where people are sitting in rows facing forward need to have a distance that could be shorter, maybe 1 metres or less, apart between participants\n* When posting an event online, make sure to add the suitable guidelines for the event\n* When starting an event/workshop, make sure to inform participants of the guidelines for your specific event\n\n* If you see an event not taking reasonable precautions, please talk to the event leaders about your concerns and reference these guidelines.", "created_at": "2020-10-27 11:42:41.913112", "updated_at": "2020-10-27 11:42:41.913112", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 617, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 334.2, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 109, 306, 285, 365, 176], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6238, "user_id": 204, "topic_id": 628, "post_number": 7, "raw": "For the last two weeks, I was on vacation.

So there is now some more breathing space at Tau that should ease this transition. We can use this room - **TEMPORARILY** - as a sorting station for everything that needs to be combed through and either moved away from Blivande or sorted into its proper long-term space. \n\nI will start by today moving over all the boxes from the electronics room so that the electronics room is freed up. Also you should know that a big reason for the blockage in the storage room next to the electronics room is that Simon is currently rebuilding his room (putting in a new raised floor to create more storage space) and in the meantime he has moved out his stuff into the storage room. He's soon finished there and then those items will go back. \n\nI personally have no insight into what is in those boxes. I know around 50% of it belongs to Olle and the remaining half is a mixed of \"good to have things\" from Stugan without a clear owner. Let's set at date very soon for a big sorting mission! Crucial that @Ollxor can be a part of that. When would be a good date for you, Olle? Maybe it could be the same date as the deadline for the tools purchase? \n\nWhen it comes to 3. those stuff all belong to Katarina who has been given permission to do so by @hugi several months ago as a quickfix to an issue then. It's something that can be revisited/re-evaluated as things change and we become more members.

Should material costs be handled through the same system as the tickets or should it be for example in cash during the workshop via swish?\n* Where will the courses show up in redovisning? Blivande or the facilitators? Are we just processing the payment or paying out the fee as a \"salary\" or similar?\n\n### Software\n* How about getting a Adobe subscription that could be used during courses or by people in the house? \n     * Could we qualify for the educational subscription for the Akademi? \n     * How keys can be used at the same time?\n     * Should we add a computer in the electronics room as a basis?\n\n### Tools and Material\n**Tools that are bought for a course but to stay \"in the house\" to enrich everyone.** \n\n   * Concrete example: do we want to have a few sets of hand carving sets from/for the woodcarving course?\n       * **Facilitators who want that need to make a post about that on the forum, explaining what they want to get and why and discuss it with the community and team.** (ping @Louisf)\n\n### Finally Alexander and Hara presented their workshop ideas with great success.\n \n\n# The following discussion led to these points we want to bring to the attention of every facilitator:\n\n *  Think about \"who\" your workshop is for.

Traditionally, art has been isolated from other avenues of work. There are many reasons for this, including that artists require access to rough spaces to build in, which is often seen as incompatible with other uses. However, much is gained by a space that allows for cross-pollination between people of different skills and professions. Sculptors and engineers. Plumbers and architects. Painters and lawyers. Performers and computer scientists. Welders and scenographers. We believe that such a place is possible, and we are building it.\n\nBlivande should be a creative village in the city and an oasis of different independent but interdependent initiatives. In 2021, we are inviting the city to Frihamnstorget for a series of art exhibitions and participatory events. Coming to Frihamstorget should feel like moving to a friendly small town \u2013 you are immediately invited to co-create and participate, and nobody is asking you to buy anything to be allowed to stay.\n\nWe see Blivande as an experiment in stewarding and cultivating a self-sustaining ecosystem, and our goal is to develop it into a model that can be replicated. We are joined in this experiment by kindred communities around the world, with whom we collaborate both formally and informally. We develop methodologies and tools and cross-reference with other initiatives to learn and level up together.\n\nWe have set as an explicit goal to blur the boundaries between professional and amateur, and between artist and audience. This, in turn, opens up for collaboration across categories among our members. Members in the arts involve members in their projects who do not identify as artists, and trust and understanding are built among them. Through that trust, it becomes possible to use resources according to ability and need, instead of through market forces. Incentives are geared towards cultivating a regenerative ecosystem; priming its members to strive for collaboration and symbiotic synergy rather than individualistic monetary profit.\n\n## Blivande organization and history\n\n![IMG_0121|666x500](upload://i8g7BxMmWbsT8ubRSfSZWW7ObkM.jpeg) \n\nBlivande Ide\u0301er AB was founded in August of 2018 with the explicit purpose of renting and maintaining a house for participatory culture and art. Blivande was founded in symbiosis with the two existing associations Noden and Stugan, which had both maintained spaces for participatory culture in Sickla in a building that was set to be demolished in late 2018.\n\nNoden had existed since 2015 and was a non-commercial community space for participatory culture and art, loosely connected to the international \u201cBurning Man\u201d movement of participatory festivals. Stugan was a makerspace for artists in the same community. Blivande was started with the explicit purpose of providing a new home for these communities.\n\nBlivande Ide\u0301er AB is a not-for-profit company formally owned by four people who each hold 25% ownership. Those people are Hugi Asgeirsson, Hampus Lindblad, Sergio Rodrigo Vargas Quiroga, and Linne\u0301a Appert. House Blivande and the adjoining Frihamnstorget are maintained and curated by the core team of Blivande Ide\u0301er AB. Blivande is a term used both to relate to the company and to the community ecosystem of associations, artists, and creators around the house and Frihamnstorget.\n\nIt is the stated intention of the group of owners to move towards a more communal form of ownership once the core activities have become self-sustaining. Shares in Blivande should not generate passive income to its shareholders. Rather, the shareholders are stewards of the vision and direction of the organization until another structure is put in place.\n\n## Blivande methods and principles\n\n### Participation\n\nWe believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We spark community through actions that open the heart.\n\n### Making meaning\n\nWhat unites the activities taking place is that they are all created with the intention of bringing people together, ideally reinforcing a sense of purpose and meaning in our everyday lives. We believe that participatory culture and art can help counter an ongoing crisis of lack of purpose and social isolation.\n\n### Microsolidarity\n\n[Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) is a set of practices for mutual support between peers. These methods bring us out of individualism and into a more relational way of being. We try to foster solidarity by encouraging the formation of crews that support each other through emotional & economic reciprocity.\n\n### Always becoming \n\nWe believe that we are always becoming and that flux is the only constant. Blivande is the Swedish word for \"becoming\" and we have chosen it to signify the essence of what we want to cultivate in ourselves and in society \u2013 that we are always in a state of becoming with everything around us.\n\n![70895113_895354574177678_3912872422044636927_n|499x499](upload://ylUPPMtBlIcwh3sVFfnVLP6ju0i.jpeg) \n\n## Blivande memberships\n\n![82945850_869954236798584_6635208938805526528_o|666x500](upload://iQCS22gRxp3j1tP26kxmYpgQLZX.jpeg) \n\nIn January 2021, Blivande is projected to have 50 members in our workshops and workspaces. By the end of 2021, we are aiming to reach 80 members, which is our full capacity at House Blivande. After that, new members would be admitted when old members leave. In 2021 we will also focus on building more capacity for artists to work and create at Frihamnstorget, opening the possibility for larger art workshops in containers in the future. From 2022 onward, Frihamnstorget would be our main avenue of expansion and growth.\n\n**Goal:** By December 31st, 2021, Blivande aims to have 80 members in our workshops and workspaces.\n\n![109816459_182553963227727_5809147911801111410_n-1|500x500](upload://1L4wHcB4WPV0AqWM3RuG2C7IuwH.jpeg) \n\n## Blivande staff and resident artists\n\nBlivande currently has a small and mostly unpaid team that works on maintaining the core activities and doing outreach and engagement for Blivande as a whole. Some of the core team are paid through project grants specific to their line of work. This includes community management and outreach for the Vinnova-funded Plato Project.\n\nIn the plan for 2020, we had planned to start paying salaries for key core team members in 2021. Like most other institutions in culture and arts, Blivande was hard hit by Covid-19, which wiped out our event income. This has made it impossible to pay salaries as planned in 2021 without the help of grants. If we receive grants from Region Stockholm, we plan to hire a Coordinating Director and an Outreach Coordinator.\n\n**Goals**\nIf Blivande receives grants to allow for it, we will hire:\n* Coordinating Director\n* Artistic Director\n* Outreach Coordinator\n* Artist as instructors for courses\n* Artists for improving Frihamnstorget \n\n## Frihamnstorget\n\n![71294174_2488756147854818_8211578106712948736_o|690x336](upload://2VXctJOCB0aSOjyQffvnpDRxvqQ.jpeg) \n\nFrihamnstorget is a meeting place for grassroots art, crafts, creativity, events, and culture \u2013 open to your initiative. We have transformed a parking lot into a communal square for culture and art. Frihamnstorget is a true \u201cthird place\u201d - neither fully private nor public, curated and maintained by its members. A comparable structure might be a Swedish \"koloniomra\u030ade\" \u2013 a patchwork of independent but interdependent initiatives that collaborate to create a place together.\n\nFrihamnstorget questions established principles of city planning and placemaking in Sweden today, and we are tilling the earth for the creativity of its members.\n\nA typical activity at Frihamnstorget is \u201cWork Is Play\u201d. Once a week during the summer months, people are invited to spend the day on the square and co-create projects while a DJ plays tunes, and food and drink are served from the cafe\u0301. Everyone is invited to pick up a tool or a paintbrush, or simply flop down in a hammock with a cold drink. Artists and makers get extra hands working on their projects, while those with less experience get an accessible way to learn new skills from talented people.\n\n### Place stewardship \n\nBlivande is the steward of Frihamnstorget. We coordinate activities, maintain the square as a whole, and ensure the safety of all installations.\n\nBlivande Ide\u0301er AB rents both House Blivande and the parking lot that has become Frihamnstorget from Stockholms Hamnar (Ports of Stockholm). Frihamnstorget is created and run in dialogue with them and the lease is renewed on an annual basis.\n\nThis sort of grassroots \"place stewardship\" is being researched and developed by Blivande alongside Stockholm University, Edgeryders, and SenseStack in the Plato Project - a Vinnova funded project in \"Civic Tech\". We build custom online tools and methodologies for others around the world to adopt.\n\n![110797469_3943755238985040_3197868448728644742_n|500x500](upload://9bGm7Gimue1ApPPdEl2DML6YuSz.jpeg) \n\n## Blivande events\n\n![74397487_819191715208170_7958193865385574400_n|666x500](upload://e4MHtsHUqEnmVLryWvsGHasYg0w.jpeg) \n\nHouse Blivande is usually open to the public every Monday to Thursday from 18:00 to 23:00 and every Sunday from 13:00 to 19:00. During these hours, activities are held by the association Noden. What unites the activities taking place is that they are all created with the intention of bringing people together, ideally contributing to reinforcing a sense of purpose and meaning in everyday life. Noden activities are open to the public, but reoccurring participants are expected to pay 100 SEK on a monthly basis to the association.\n\nBlivande also aims to be the most unique and intimate small event venue in Stockholm, and we accommodate private events, exhibitions, and clubs as well as our pubic community events.\n\n![79431320_841305662996775_3834807884340789248_n|537x500](upload://7TaoWjCrIYfTBa3TGw0mOq6taKk.jpeg) \n\n![86472179_891742824619725_3910153735405305856_o|666x500](upload://ns1BGWKT0zzzougCHct9JF9SV5m.jpeg) \n\n## Blivande Art Program\n\nIn 2021 we are planning a series of participatory events and art projects that will explore what participation can mean across genre and media. This event series is closely tied to our art workshops and Frihamnstorget, and each project and activity is designed to involve and engage the participants in the future development and community of Blivande. Our goal is for every participant to feel like a co-creator of Blivande and Frihamstorget, and that they will feel secure in referring to these as \"their\" community. All events in the \"Always Becoming\" event series are open to the public.\n\nSome of the programme is pending funding. See it here: [Always Becoming 2021.pdf|attachment](upload://2mo7kO3pOKiGOgWfrUxs6vUPOvO.pdf) (66.2 KB) \n\n## Galleri Frihamnstorget\n\n![Fleshlayers_Cecilia Klementsson_2|690x457](upload://uyvyWoFdkOEhZ29OdfS11NVIFMQ.jpeg) \n\n[Gallery Frihamnstorget](https://www.gallerifrihamnstorget.com/) is available to selected artists for a calendar month at a time. Artists are selected based on their proposed exhibitions submitted [on our platform](https://dreams.blivande.com/gallery) as well as through direct invitation. Exhibiting at Gallery Frihamnstorget is free and access to tools, machines, and workspaces can be given through signing up for a one-month membership to House Blivande. We currently do not take any provisions from art sold at the gallery.\n\n## Placemaking Tools: Plato Project\n\nTogether with SenseStack, a company owned in part by Blivande Ide\u0301er, along with Edgeryders, and Stockholm University, Blivande is developing a set of digital tools and services to placemaking and place stewardship.\n\nPlato (Placemaking Tools) is a digital service for citizen-driven placemaking initiatives. A collection of integrated digital platforms focuses on every part of the process, from idea to decision, implementation, and maintenance. Cooperation between citizens and the public sector is enabled and simplified by integrating and strengthening all parts of the process into the same suite of tools. Citizen initiatives are taken care of, while the public sector's processes are simplified and made accessible.\n\nPlato takes a holistic approach to digital placemaking tools and integrates testing and workshops directly from the start. To ensure usability and quality, the tool and methods are developed while being used in a real placemaking use case. This use case is Frihamnstorget, which uses the project \u0301s tools and methods in collaboration with students and researchers from Stockholm University.\n\nPlato Project is led by Blivande co-founder Hugi Asgeirsson and members Jakob Skote and Gustav Larsson. Plato Project is funded by Vinnova with 2 million SEK and runs until August 2021.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-08-25 at 23.06.45|689x463](upload://cBvBREvYGC2w1n1baDE5ZLDkQqI.png)", "created_at": "2020-10-08 01:02:59.702978", "updated_at": "2020-10-11 13:18:40.554164", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2010, "wiki": false, "reads": 43, "score": 2198.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34, 10, 225, 384, 15], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2845, "user_id": 186, "topic_id": 647, "post_number": 18, "raw": "I was a bit reluctant to a new location, and now that I have made the floor plans for it I fully agree with @hampus on this.

I just had a meeting with Hampus and we agreed that is ok as long as I ask the rest of you here on the forum for the best solution for everyone.\n\nSo there are three options\n\n1, keep it as it is now (pros, the big white wall is free, cons, might feel in the way for people doing splattering stuff on the working tables (although now we have much bigger floor space for such works) \n\n2, hang it on the white wall (pros, its not in the way for splattering work on the working table, also the zink for that wall will not be installed before 15th of april, and none of the flex members seem to be working on things that require that entire wall, that would require a fix membership and apparently that room won't be used for more fixed members, so the likelihood that a flex member will require the entire wall is very small. \nCons, It is taking part of a wall, but as I said no flex members can use the entire wall unless it's a temporary project, and there is the project space for that.) \n\n3. Refurnish the entire room and move all my painting within my space (pros, its all in my space.\nCons, the furniture doesn't really funktion any other way, if you want the use all sides if the working table you don't want to place them too close to one another. I would also have to build another easel for the painting to stand safely. \n\nPersonally I think option 2 is best in terms of not being in any other flex members way, if I flex member should require that wall however they are most welcome to come and speak to me and I will go for one of the other options. \n\nFurther, I will add that if someone would like to use the entire wall for e.g. photo documentation of their own work, they may ask me and I can move my work temporarily.\n\n\nAll the best, lots of love\n\nCecilia\n\nxxxx", "created_at": "2020-12-09 09:56:27.153895", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 09:56:27.153895", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7286, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1484, "post_number": 7, "raw": "If TT maintains a similar ticket price as earlier years the fundraising margin will be significantly smaller. This assuming TT doesn't lower its price to compensate, which they very well could (and should) do. \n\nI would bring this up with Frallan and suggest that you pay the same per participant as we have done previous years. The rent for the 200 person event has been around 60 000 so multiply that by 0.375 (200*0.375=75) and you get 22 500. \n\nThis is very much their off-season (there won't be any other guests there anyway) and they very much enjoy having the events there. \n\nI would also raise it to 100 rather than 75 but that's just IMO. The only significant difference you will get in terms of risk for virus transmission will be around lunch and dinner time when everyone gathers at Kaffestugan. The difference of 25 people is small and if you combine it with other measures such as open windows with cross draft and/or eating at different set times rather than everyone at the same time (divide the participants in two groups with different wristbands or something) I don't think having an extra 25 people there is a real problem at all. \n\nEven with 200 participants a lot of the places and rooms are often more or less empty. The bottlenecks that exist will exist also with 75 people and you won't get people to stop cuddling in tiny cottages and so on regardless. \n\nGood luck and thanks for being a torchbearer for the event!\n\n*PS.*\n\n*Using Burnertickets will likely be more expensive than Noden's Moonclerk account. Another option is for Noden to use their Stripe acount and connect it to Blivande's ticket system running Pretix. Then you get the same system used by Borderland. Arguably much better than Burnertickets dated system. Then you simply have TT invoice Noden after the event and you use the Noden debit card to buy groceries if needed. Ideally take as many costs as you can on invoice (have Gustaf S\u00f6derfelt buy the groceries through his company etc).*\n\n*DS.*", "created_at": "2020-09-29 18:12:12.789571", "updated_at": "2020-09-29 18:16:59.071100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 3.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7568, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1351, "post_number": 46, "raw": "I doubt it given that they are no longer in Frihamnen.

Both the one who's boundaries were overstepped and those who overstepped someones boundaries. I am starting to notice, that I feel quite lost in these processes. I am not a professional, rather \"only\" a person with big heart. \n\nWe do not have thousands of cases, but I noticed now, that I do feel quite alone when it comes to supporting the incidences and being there until the support is not needed anymore. Don't get me wrong, I choose to be there and I want to be there. What I need is a bit more of a community to hold me, when I am not available and thus those that need it in the moment. \n\nI am struggling to find and define the boundaries for the help that we as non-professionals can offer to community members. I am also struggling with the very individual nature of the cases, which makes every case feel like \"the first time I am doing this.\"\n\nI have reached out to organisations like storasyster and novahuset, who have a lot of experience in these instances and hope that we can get some help finding the boundaries of community involvement possible in consent cases. I hope that we can organize an event/training around this with these groups/organisations, that have been around and handling cases like this for a long time. I wrote them the following:\n\n> *My name is Diana and I am a very active member in the community in and around House Blivande (blivande.com). I part of the board of Noden (noden.community) a f\u00f6rening that co-creates events, workshop and happenings on a non-profit basis.*\n> \n> *We are also closely linked to a nordic festival called the Borderland that is also a non-profit participatory culture event.*\n> \n> *I write as I have been stepping up in creating dialogue and information about consent in these communities. I am mainly helping and supporting women and men that were in a consent breach to have communication and support around what happened. It is actually a very energy demanding and time consuming work, that I slowly feel myself unable to do alone. We are a big community and I really would like to receive some help and support in educating others to handle situations where consent was breached.*\n> \n> *I am reaching out hoping that we could organize and event together, where we talk about what consent violations actually are, the legal situation in Sweden and how to help and support victims of consent breaches. I wonder what we could do together and if you have someone in mind, that has previously instructed and helped organisations step up to the awareness of consent. We are definitely not doing too bad, but we could be doing better.*\n> \n> *I feel that I could probably do with some training myself, where we talk about how to respond a preson that just has been sexually harassed or assaulted. I am assuming you have a lot of experiences on what is the right thing to say, how to support someone and what is actually possible and healthy to do as a volunteer and non-professional and where the line lies of what we can do.*\n> \n> *I am really looking forward to your answer and hope to learn a lot from your experience.*\n> \n> *All the best, Diana*\n\nI know there are some groups and efforts ongoing around Borderland in Denmark. Here in Stockholm however, I really feel alone in my availability and I don't want to work like this anymore. I am choosing to be transparent to you to find interested humans and state my boundaries openly. \n\nThis is to be continued!\n\nDiana", "created_at": "2020-10-22 09:24:13.576102", "updated_at": "2020-10-22 09:24:13.576102", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 638, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 187.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 210, 270, 413], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7229, "user_id": 311, "topic_id": 1477, "post_number": 4, "raw": "fantastic,\n\nand since the upstairs container is yours, we can forget about the cloud idea for now, lets focus on the eye and lips, that i can paint with the same colors as your windows Nina,\n\ni will work on finding an appropriate spot for a hand on one of the side, since it is another strong symbol that represents the concept of the square itself very well, handmade, work, lines of life, perhaps we can add some hand painting motif like henna to make it more intricate and culturally diverse and interesting.", "created_at": "2020-09-28 16:25:55.305370", "updated_at": "2020-09-28 16:42:14.574626", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 93, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 19.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7227], "is_liked_by": [322], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7867, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1580, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@jonasjohansson, are you doing something with your students at Blivande in the coming week?", "created_at": "2020-10-20 19:46:30.551995", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 19:46:30.551995", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 8.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7847, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 180, "post_number": 80, "raw": "I placed a heater in the laser container 6-12 months ago.
