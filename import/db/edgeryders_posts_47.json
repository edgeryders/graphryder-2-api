That long gasping sounds, which thrilled the beats of millions. And the aftermath it brought left smiles in the face of no one. How was that day like ? For you who were in the valley ? Can you ever forget that moment. That instant ! May be you were not hurt. May be your old family members were not the ones who were buried below the wrecks of houses. May be none of your friends were missing, may be none of the ones you really know got even hurt by a falling thing. But did you smiled ? Could you have laughed ? Were you even a bit happy ?\n\nI don't think you should continue to read further if you answer 'Yes'. I think I saw the real world after the shake. I think that shake really brought something out from deep down the people living in this busy city of Kathmandu. Funny thing the destruction of the soul less buildings and all flourished such immense feelings. The ever rising Victims toll. We thought that would never stop. But it's calm now. And may be it's now easy to forget that.\n\nThat day I saw why we are humans. I saw people helping each other. Police vans carrying the victims to the hospital. Doctors rushing here and there. But I didn't felt this certain feeling that time. I was running through Bir hospital that day. But now I remember that couple who were crying in the bench over their lost son, that woman who was crying by the side of her husband who had lost his legs. That old woman who couldn't even stand and was lying on the bench, her grandson who was panicking on what he could do. I saw humanity in such an inhumane day. With bloodstains in my hand.\n\nI cannot forget that. May be you can if your day was easy. It happens. But now if we are talking about the disaster, we definitely are talking about how we acted after it. Every Nepali got a sense of sympathy, more over a feeling that they wanted to help. Both who were inside the country and out. The huge flow of relief funds and materials. That was a great thing to hear in such hours of troubles.\n\nAlso the people all over the world. The foreigners. And this group of Future Makers, who were still continuing the work. But now the question, is how to continue on the work. Because we know what we have done till now is still not enough. That there are greater troubles to handle. Who should do it ? how can they ?\n\nCo-operation is the word. We cannot be with specific ideas and go on individually in times like these. Just helping for satisfying oneself doesn't sounds brilliant when you look back at it. The problem will be there and all you can say is you tried that you contributed a little. So we all with positive mind frames, with the will to do should gather and the try to focus what the next step. Its a universal approach, but it works if done with devotion.\n\nThe major challenges of Nepal are still the tough geography. But by this time the aid materials must have already been delivered to the places. So now, we have to try to focus on something that is a bigger problem. Which is illiteracy. Its the greatest demon may be. The low education standard throughout Nepal has become a trouble for decades now and made famous by the course books. Each year government is spending its biggest share of budget in the improvement of eduction, and its the biggest flop. So we need to plan on improving the education bar in the rural. May be proposing the government schools there, off-course with earthquake proof buildings. And other education facilities like public libraries, awareness program, adult classes. All these. We don't necessarily need the big donations from all over the world. We just need to cooperate, with ourselves.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-20 13:01:42", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:51:28.878851", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 710, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16881, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3119, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>developmental evaluation</b>\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/mea4oeMZ\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-07 19:30:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.367122", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20784, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6395, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>section 4.2 done</b>\n\nDoing another read-through now to resolve remaining todo parts and to add any necessary sources (although I need whoever wrote the bit on foresight and democratic stakeholder dialogue to add their citation there)\n\nSee y'all soon!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-24 16:26:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.673500", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 51, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5403, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5370, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Imported from the hackpad:\u00a0https://lote5.hackpad.com/SAT-0930-1045-MASTERS-OF-NETWORKS-NETWORKS-OF-CARE-hackathon-for-network-scientists-doctors-and-patients-to-make-sense-o-vxaFSnxaNTg. Thanks to all note takers, especially Rossella B.</em>\n\nThis is the main conversation\u00a0\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/masters-of-network-4-networks-of-care\n\nYou can download Tulip from here\n\nhttp://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/\n\nYou can download the data file here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7HgdYQcOLwncWhwQ3lKdmZXMmM/view\n\nThe data we have are about edgeryders users, which posts they posted and who reacted\u00a0\n\nwe want to see how they interact, so we want to link them to one another\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Tulip</h3>\n\nIf you click on \"user to post\" in tulip, you see emphasized the users that have written the original post, and which posts they wrote, linked to that user.\n\nIf you click on one of the posts you see information about the post, the text, the date, the title, plus some information that is internal to the software and is not so interesting for us.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Semantics</h3>\n\nEdgeryders supports in-platform etnographic tagging. Ethnography is a qualitative method to analyze texts and attach tags to the texts that represent what the text says. The tags have to be standardized, so different researchers can be consistent in the use.\u00a0\n\nIn the past ethnographic researches where limited because it was costly to gather the texts via interviews and transcripts. They are not statistically representative.\n\nEdgeryders supports in-platform etnographic tagging. Of course, most content in Edgeryders is NOT ethnographically tagged: ethnography is expensive, and we only do it as part of contracts in which ethnography is used to lift collective expert advice from the conversation.\n\nOnline the texts are already written, so they don't need to be transcribed, and the ethnographers' codes can be kept together with the texts.\n\nThese tags are composed of super-classes (f.i. \"Topic\" or \"Place\") and they can be nested, and for each super-class you can entry different values (f.i. \"Charity\" or \"Cairo\").\n\nAn example: the users writes \"Our task will be to explore how we may then model interaction beween users,\" -&gt; the ethnographer attaches the tag \"interaction\" . This tag is added in the html code of the platform, directly linked to the original text.\n\nWhen this happens, a semantic layer is added to Edgeryders content. \u00a0We can add semantics to the social network representation of the Edgeryders conversation: not just \"who is talking to whom\", but, adding semantics, \"who is talking to whom about what\".\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Edgeryders data</h3>\n\nOn Edgeryders, the ethnographic data are linked to other kind of data, like the profile of the users (age, location etc), the circumstances surrounding the text. We have these ethnographer-coded data only for a specific conversation (because we had financing to gather it). We want to do this again in Open Care.\n\nOf course you do not have all the information about the context of a conversation, for instance you don't know what happened besides the online platform. We will still miss a lot, and make misinterpretations.\n\nQuestion (Ezio Manzini): what is the object that you are observing? Is it a conversation on Open Care or is it a conversation on Open Care in the context of the Edgeryders platform, and such and such.\n\nA problem about \"large scale conversations\": a large number of users does not imply that many people will participate in the conversation. In the course of a EU project called CATALYST we learned that almost no threads have more than 10 participants, even in \"large communities\" like Loomio, with 10K users.\n\nWe should rephrase the question says Ezio, one that is more precisely the question that can be answered by this tool. Yes, but we need to use the tool to discover the question. You have some questions and in the process you will discover more questions.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Network</h3>\n\nWe have users who initiate posts and reply to posts with comments. We have ethnographers who will tag some of the texts. We want to discover how people interact and what the conversations will be about.\n\nWhen you click\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"user to user\" in Tulip you actually see the people who interact (have a conversation).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>user to comments: which comments they made</li>\n\n<li>\"post to groups\" you see the posts that have been added in the group.</li>\n\n<li>user to tags tells you which users are talking about a tag - if you believe in collective intelligence you need more than this because you still don't know if these users are talking to each other -&gt; you want to see the conversations between the users that contain this tag, that is when the semantic is important</li>\n\n<li>we also want to link concepts to other concepts</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHere you an see if a tag was interesting and if it was important. When people share something or comment is a different thing. Relevance can become important as well. (This previous has to do with sentiment analysis) But it is not the core of what we want to do in Open Care. It can be important to single out the people who talk about a topic.\n\nidealistic idea of human interaction. Deep conversation, rather than big data.\n\nUser-to-tags networks are not easy to interpret. Guy and Benjamin Renoust introduced semantic edges show me only the edges that include \"real action\" as tag. another idea is visualising two networks, one of people to people and one of tags to tags. if you 'lasso\" a topic you sese the network of people who talked about it. if you lasso two topics you see the people who talked about either (but you can switch view and see who talked about both). if the people have been talking to each other about the tag then the edge becomes red as well, otherwise only the node. If you select a user you can see the tags he's been talking about.\n\nIn this version of the network, people are connected if one of them reacts to the other's post of comment. If someone reacts to a comment to somebody's else's post, then he'll be connected to the author of the comment but not to the author of the post. It is possible with these data to make different choices.\u00a0\n\nStart from a tag, say \"open-source software\" and\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>see if the people talking about it are also talking to each other. If so, we can speak of \u00a0an emergent group of specialists, emergent because it \"happened\", nobody assigned them to do that. The word \"group\" is critical here: if people were just speaking about open source software in isolation, they could be in total disagreement and not even know about it, but if they are talking to each other about open source software there can be a convergence going on, like when Wikipedians weed out mistakes in the encyclopedia's articles.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>lasso those guys and see what else they are also talking about, and get an indicative map of how this emergent group of experts sees the topic.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe present data are \"post-mortem\" of the conversation. The ideal situation is to be able to analyze the conversation with this tool almost \"real-time\", let's say on a daily basis. This, however, has the problem that ethnographic research does not really work that way: ethnographers find it easier to maintain consistency if they work in batch.\u00a0\n\nGuy: The tool could influence people to do more if it was available. It can be a user tool, besides a research tool. Alberto: However the Edgesense tool was made available to the community, and there do not seem to be that many people looking at it.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Edgesense</h3>\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html\n\nThe color coding are the nodes that are more connected to each other that to other members of the group. If you are very active you have \"your own\" group. For instance Noemi, her group is not exactly a star but very central.\n\nThe links are directional: two nodes can be linked by two curved lines, one from node a to node b, the other in the opposite direction.\n\nYou \u00a0can show by degree (number of connections), select only the edges that link to and from the moderators. You can also hide them and see that the network is still holding. Some people fall out, but the giant component remains.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">OpenCare narrative</h3>\n\nThis example also helps clarify Ezio's question above. What is the question that this network representation can answer? The sociology of the network. It helps manage the group. The network we saw on Tulip, it might be worth spending some time to find a bridge between what the tool can do, and the general question \"what is open care\". IN which ways can it be helpful?\n\nThis network is updated real-time. What would be a proper time frame for a semantic coding? The coding needs some consistency. So the ethnographer will say you make a conversation and then we tag it. The project on open care does not include a real-time semantic coding. That is a lot of work and would be a big addition to the project, needing its own financing.\n\nKeywords. Quality tracking. Network authoritativeness. You could use the latter to filter what the ethnographer has to code, so the method becomes scalable. Not by using robots (not working with ethnography) but because you use network math to filter the content.\n\nAuthor generated tags can work if implemented with auto-prompting and proper incentives, Harry Halpin has published on this about Delicious. Ethnography would not agree, Alberto believes., we can't trust it, although we can try it. But the added values is in small numbers, because then it can be used by smaller communities as well.\u00a0\n\nEzio: the tool also needs to help develop some intervention. For instance spotting the emergent group of experts could be a useful intervention for the Comune di Milano. We need to develop a narrative like that about the tool we saw in Tulip for Open Care. Alberto believes he has a narrative, a strong hypothesis. Collective intelligence. Small scale collective intelligence. Problems are local, resources are local. So if we have a permanent think-tank on a platform and a cheap way to harvest from it, then we have a tool for a local community to use. You can identify the emergent groups of experts on specific topics and look at them rather than having to make a large scale study.\u00a0\n\nInstead of going up, going big I'm trying to go down, go deep, focus on a small group of people, without drawing a line around them (because then you'd loose the openness).\n\nEzio: I've never posted. It would be different if someone would ask around if they have something to say. Now I am here and I talk to people, I feel committed. But now I understand that we have to write because if we talk now we cannot register what we say. Alberto: This is the open. You commit to make the things you said available to people you did never even meet.\n\nEzio: we are collectively writing a document. You should know who the contributors are. At a certain point, you can say this is the book we wrote and these people wrote. The way this book was written has made it possible to work in a certain way. Alberto: yes, in the end, the ethnographic report will say we had these number of people and...\u00a0\n\nEzio: if I want to participate I have to write and I have to be very attentive. Alberto: you can also choose to be a marginal author, just have a role along the side. And you still are a coauthor. Also the cook who made the lunch at the Lote5 meeting mattered in the making of the book.\n\nEzio: co-design process. These tools could be part of the solution. We are now a network and there could then be a network of nurses doctors etc. This discussion can in a similar way happen among care-givers? Costantino: the conversation will not be the result of this group, but of a larger group. But the network of care-givers might be not committed, skilled, or motivated to use an online tool.\u00a0\n\nAs an example it is possible to use the results of the ethnographic study to feed the discussion at the Comune di Milano. Alberto: Ideally you bridge across. Costantino: this is the hard part. If the discussion is not well documented and published in the coming days, then the online community will miss it. And viceversa. So the tricky part is right here. How can we bring them across each other. In terms of artifact, in terms of codesign, our committment is to at least make transparent what are the needs of the people that we are meeting, how are the codesign sessions organised. Upload the design of a artifact online so that other people can contribute. Many levels: design, conversation... We are going far beyojnd ER as it was right now. We are not only creating a book or a report we are also committed to create real prototypes. So we need to go one step forward, so that we have the tools to manage not only the online conversation but also the other levels. But the online conversation is key to all this.\n\nAlberto: we are not trying to invent a new methodology, just trying to do it well. The online community is key because of permanency, findability, linkability...\n\nA discussion about Wikipedia, the major difficulty is that we do not own that platform so we can't control. I'm in a village and need info, i go to wikipedia, and ER might use that.\u00a0\n\nYou can't brief too much in terms of what will emerge in terms of design.\u00a0\n\nPeople in Milano have clear problems: Where do I leave my kids. You try to solve, and the solutions kind of work and we try to use this process to make it better.\n\nThe process that we are following here is not the prototype. The prototype we talk about is some care solution. Online the local problem in Milano goes global and someone from France can intervene in the conversation. The prototyping part is in Milan, but care issues are similar all over the world.\u00a0\n\nIn the Spot the Future project we saw the the international interaction was very valuable. The capability of transferring the knowledge by solutions found abroad to other context is exactly the point that makes it possible to finding new solutions.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Afternoon session</h2>\n\nTwo groups: quality of data and Wikipedia data\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Quality of data session</h3>\n\nWe used Tulip and Detangler to explore a semantic network dataset similar to the one that will be used for Open Care. We filter our data according to two proxies for quality:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>post/comment length as quality: discard all posts and comments under, say, 100 characters. This would only keep thoughtful contribution.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>user pagerank as quality: pagerank or other eigenvector centrality measures are often associated to correlate to authoritativeness. So, we can reduce the network to the contributions made by the highest-ranking individuals.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe hypothesis is that the reduced semantic social networks would not be much different from the non-reduced ones. If that is confirmed, the methodology is scalable: if you get a ton of content, just filter it for quality, and work only on the top-quality 15%.\u00a0\n\nWe walked through the exercise and found that our reducing code works. However, we found inconsistencies in the data (many comments and posts with apparently no text \u2013 though, when we checked them on the Edgeryders platform, of course the text was there!). We do not feel confident to draw any conclusion. The group resolved to redo the exercise starting from a fresh extraction. Guy Melan\u00e7on is taking the lead for this.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Wikipedia session</h3>\n\nWe made a sketch of a graphic representation of the medical articles on wikipedia in all languages. The larger the node, the more often a page has been visited and links represent the hyperlinks between pages. We use this representation to explore the data and look at emerging patterns. For instance we will compare the structure of the networks in the different language to see if there might be cultural or geographical properties that can lead to interesting research questions.\n\nThe code for the Wikipedia session can be found here: https://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/visualizing-self-diagnosis\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-03 14:07:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:31.124842", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2976, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26985, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4515, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Can you repost where the link above points to?</b>\n\nThat way we can concentrate the discussion at one place and it is less likely that something is overlooked.

As a generation, we don\u2019t all cope in the same way. We move interchangeably between egocentrism, altruism, apathy and even alienation. This is why the social contract is so brittle in our hands.</span>\n\n<span>We forget that the concept of a social contract was based on a more visceral relationship that people had with the economy, with politics and with their communities. People knew where they stood and where they\u2019d end up. Our generation, on the other hand, has always been taught to climb the social ladder higher than our families had ever been before\u2026with school a waiting room to prepare us for the workplace. But </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/Vu1bGJ\">\u201cthere is little or no workplace to \"enter\"</a><span> and we\u2019ve fallen further down the ladder than we started off.</span>\n\n<span>For many of us, our \u201cspending power\u201d has been sufficient enough to avoid any need to produce. It has disguised the fact that the structures of power controlling consumption have strangled the capacity for local production - and our market-driven education has suffocated our capability to repair, re-use and reinvent goods rather than just buy new products.</span>\n\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">How do we redefine cultural identities to help us create meaning?</strong>\n\n<span>This contrasts with a Baltic </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/YEqcfS\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">pride in home-grown resources</a><span> as a source of inspiration for industries as diverse as </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/153DCYa\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">food</a><span>, energy and even design, an </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/13aTh51\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">education system built around developing wellbeing &amp; trust</a><span> and a </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/UEjlX1\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">make(r)-do approach</a><span> to being self-sufficient and </span><a href=\"http://www.letsdoitworld.org/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">looking after nature</a><span>. These are all manifestations of deeply embedded cultural identities across the Baltic region, albeit having gone through very different </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/UEjlX1\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">social histories</a><span>. But in an era where our generation wear multiple identities \u2013 how much do these cultural identities still exert a magnetic force on how we see the world?</span>\n\n<span>Indeed, as consumers, we\u2019ve built our identities out of the brands that we identify with. We get tempted to publicise our private emotions and relegate our family and friends to cameo roles. We try to act out a role, convinced that what we consume defines how successful we are; how worthy we are of attention.</span>\n\n<span>In some ways it feels like the only response possible. We prefer the conformism of running the rat race like a hamster on a spinning wheel. We prefer the quick fixes of consuming, because we fear the \u201ceyes of others\u201d looking down on us as we drop off the ladder of social mobility, because we fear not knowing what to \u201cget out of bed\u201d nor how to \u201cpay the rent\u201d when we don\u2019t know how to make a successful transition into adulthood.</span>\n\n<span>But what is a successful transition? Given the cultural identities across the Baltic region, might these foreshadow\u00a0</span><span>forms of transition that go beyond the degree-job-house-marriage-children formula?</span>\n\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We are family? Folkemmet<sup>2</sup></strong>\n\n<span>The Edgeryders Guide to the Future analyses how important families are in helping young people cope with new ways of making a living, and how peer networks are taking on the characteristics associated with families, epitomised by the </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/WRmD7Q\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">unMonastery</a><span> project. In Mediterranean countries, the family has always been the primary form of support and now that the emerging welfare state has crumbled away, it is all that is left. However, in the Nordic region, the concept of the family itself was redefined through the concept of </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Folkhemmet</em><span>, where the \u201centire society ought to be like a small family, where everybody contributes\u201d. This set in stone a social contract based around decentralised and collective risk-sharing between institutions to support individuals &amp; communities \u2013 what we know as the Nordic social model.</span>\n\n<span>As a generation who\u2019ve been taught that we live in a society where there are no risks and as a result, find it more difficult to cope with the challenges we\u2019re faced with and bounce back, how valuable would a social contract be that was bound around decentralised &amp; collective risk sharing? Of course, we shouldn\u2019t confuse the institutions that embodied the \u201c</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/W4aKP7\">people\u2019s home</a><span>\u201d \u2013 from the state to organised labour \u2013 with the social goods they produce(d). But we do urgently need social infrastructure that builds collective resilience that knots together communities, networks and individuals. The concept of </span><em>folkhemmet</em><span> and the social infrastructure that grew out of it was born of its time \u2013 almost 100 years ago. What should this look like? Edgeryders have looked to </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/Zg5F73\">Parralel Polis</a><span> which looks to parallel institutions; Nadia highlights </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/VGeN48\">structures that build resilience</a><span>.</span>\n\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">From \u201con your own\u201d economics to resilient structures</strong>\n\n<span>But it is difficult to make the jump into this brave new world: \u201c</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/nVI6uH\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">After two generations of \u201cyou are on your own\u201d economics, it is really hard for people to ask for and receive help from their neighbours\u2026The pressure and the responsibility of creating a new economy felt overwhelming, even paralyzing, and what I was doing felt silly and small.</a><span>\u201d (</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/qVonbh\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">@resiliencircles</a><span>).</span>\n\nThis provides a background for the challenge that <a href=\"http://bit.ly/X45CZR\">@dougald</a> sets for us to make the transition to a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/153Fzni\">regeneration of meaning</a>. Christopher urges us <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Vu1bGJ\">not to forget social institutions</a> and what we ask of them. There is a risk that groups unintentionally self-exclude themselves from formal support and their voices become silent and silenced. Precarity affects how we pay the rent, how we get out of bed and how we\u2019re seen in the eyes of others, but it also exhausts us psychologically and physically - affecting our capacity to think and act politically.\n\n<span>Will we see a world where those with the greatest power, it industries, sectors organisations, will co-opt &amp; suck up all the value the new business models being developed by informal groups? People developing these new models collaboratively, transparently and most importantly unpaid may become disillusioned, and will either accept nondisclosure agreements with those co-opting their ideas to survive or will venture further away from the formal economy and trust fewer and fewer institutions.</span>\n\nOr will we see a world where people start learning from the dynamics of the informal economy, and by doing so learn from traditionally marginalised communities for whom this is the default way of making a living? What we might ask then of social institutions are the resources that help us cope with trying to make a living \u2013 like a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/VGeN48\">basic income</a> suggested by Nadia.\n\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Creating \u201cin-between spaces\u201d</strong>\n\n<span>Another challenge </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/X45CZR\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">@dougald</a><span> poses is how these initiatives can coalesce into something serious. Scaling up is difficult to achieve because the social maps of the adopters will always be different from those who\u2019ve invented the concept that is being scaled. But how about scaling across \u2013 where we </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/Y79Jlu\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">knit &amp; knot together complementary activities</a><span> </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/XNIw8d\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(@tessybritton</a><span>) that sit at the intersection between the formal and the informal economy?</span>\n\n<span>Should we value the </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/VGeN48\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">spaces in between the formal &amp; informal economy</a><span> to rehearse behaviours and ways of living that foreshadow alternatives. After all, \u201cfiction becomes reality when people choose to invest in it\u201d </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/XNIAVC\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(@leashless</a><span> or quoted by him!).</span>\n\n<span>Just as gangs create new codes to define themselves, we too need to think of new ways to define ourselves as a generation. If \u2018fast food\u2019 could change the script for having a meal, or if campaigners on disability rights could develop a social model that\u2019s transformed the way we see the relationship between public services and its users, if the Scandinavians could redefine the concept of the family to embed a new social contract, could we </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/nGA1sb\">create scripts</a><span> to change the way we expect to make a living?</span>\n\n<span>How would you redefine the embedded cultural identities in your countries to create new meaning for informal and formal social structures to work together? What examples exist of informal &amp; formal social structures working together in practice?</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-24 09:15:59", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 12:30:52.663947", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1867, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [45, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13204, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 2692, "post_number": 8, "raw": "i went with composer.io\n\nif someone sees a double tweet today it's because there's no delete button that i can find in composer.io\u00a0\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b39823fad67971c6bd7c395ef2f6fecc2d68f41a.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"349\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-04 15:52:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.771501", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13165], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5223, "user_id": 3027, "topic_id": 5190, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2009/3/17/1237305522358/Meredith-L.-Patterson-001.jpg?w=620&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=824fcdc6497b8536fc2dadc85ea6d061\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\nFrom the series of IETF \"Requests for Comments\" that define the structure and function of the networks we use, to the PC clone wars of the 1980s, to the browser wars of the 1990s, to the DRM battles of the 2000s, to today's proliferation of web standards, the history of the Internet can be regarded as a timeline of averting failures to interoperate.\n\nWe'll look at the incentives that promote and hinder interoperability, the kinds of failure modes that proliferate in the absence of interoperation, and strategies that developers have innovated for identifying and routing around failure to interoperate.

When you collect ideas, etc. you want a low threshold - thus no commitment required.\n\nIn my opinion this is a good approach. Not only because for reasons related to the brainstorming process but also because really good people are often really busy. (1 day per week can be a lot - who manages to dedicate 1 hour per day to physical fitness?)\n\n2.a) When you commit limited (in amount and impact) outsider-resources you need leverage and complementarity through local effort.\n\n2.b) Most projects will need a minimum continuous input to keep them breathing. But required effort over time usually varies a lot for various reasons, and a continuous input (e.g. 1 d/w) may not work well in general.\n\nNow my 2 cent:\n\nHas anyone got experience with making a deliberately micro-networked approach for such things, where it is not just \"myself and some outsider\", but \"a bunch of my buddies, me, and some outsider\". Psychologically a big difference. Resilience and skill sharing wise also. The group of locals has to be organized enough so that it can be handled as one node.\u00a0Information spread among them is expected to be near instantaneous. Ideally they have 2 interface persons with high passive availability, and overlap into other local clusters.\n\nE.g. they commit to supporting with X hours, per Y, but XX hours per YY minimum. Response time is agreed to as ZZ hours (with Z std dev).\n\n<strong>Communication is what got cheaper, so we ought to be able to involve more people and drive down individual commitment costs.</strong> My gut reaction was that a \"1 day a week\" borders on infanticide* (to stick with the orphan-metaphor). <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf_Pavlik</a> I think I understand your problem and I sympathize. The hope I have is that you will get more people involved, some of whom will rise to the occasion if they see that the others need them. Often these people are too moderate or shy to join such an effort from the start - they need some time to lurk around the project first.\n\n*We ought to get the metaphor / narrative framework for this \"fixed\" at some point I think. \"Orphanages\" do work - and may be pretty effective in some contexts, but I personally feel a little uneasy with that phrase. I've thought about \"orbit\" for a time (which is not good), and I've heard \"freezer\" (which I like better). But the \"freezer\" is too friendly in my view.

I prefer to refer to the notion of \u2018designing coalitions\u2019 for reasons that are discussable, but that are to long to be explained in these initial notes). **** Pelle Ehn, Thomas Binder, Per Linde et al, What is the object of design? (2012)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt comes that the infrastructuring activity can be seen as an <em>open-ended \u2018horizontal\u2019 project</em>, where different coalitions that aggregate around specific matters of concern may start and enhance a diversity of <em>specific \u2018vertical\u2019 projects</em>. (in realty, things are more complex than this, but, for the moment, let\u2019s keep it simple, adopting this dualistic, horizontal/vertical, duality).\n\nUsing this background and this language, the original Noemi\u2019s question, \u201chow can collective capacity be sustained?\u201d, could become, and be articulated in, something like that:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>How, up to now, the infrastructuring activity done by OpenCare succeeded in creating a favourable environment where different matters of concern have had the possibility to emerge, designing coalitions to be created and specific vertical\u2019 projects to be started and enhanced?</em></li>\n\n<li><em>Which are the lectures we can learn from what has been done until now? How could limits be overcome? How could opportunities be better understood? How this experience could be improved and relicated in different contexts, and in realtion to different themes?</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTo answer these general questions, some first steps should be done, considering and analysing the nature of both the <em>Opencare\u2019s infrastructuring activity</em> and the<em> specific conversations and activities </em>that happened thanks it.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Opnecare\u2019s infrastructuring activity</em>: what has been done to start the process and to day-by-day manage it? Which are the affordances embedded in it?... etc.</li>\n\n<li><em>Conversations and activities</em> which matters of concern emerged? Which designing coalitions have been formed? Which projects have been started?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>3. My personal interest in this theme.</strong> One of the topic I am presently working on relates to the design contribution to (1) \u201cthe politics of everyday\u201d and, consequently, to (2) a democracy where individual and collaborative projects of life can exist and thrive.\n\nGiven that, I think that me motivation of my interest on if and how an infrastructuring activity as the Opencare one can become a favorable environment for different kinds of projects, is self-evident.\n\nOf course, this motivation would be the core of the paper if I had to do it alone. I am curious to read what are you yours. And to start a conversation on them \u2026\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-07 09:41:07", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:52.525999", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1012, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3357, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3324, "post_number": 1, "raw": "unConference sessions#2\n\nDate: 2014-10-24 12:30:00 - 2014-10-24 13:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2014-07-15 16:28:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.455200", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11314, "user_id": 3370, "topic_id": 519, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks for the analysis Noemi.

So far, we have followed\u00a0two different approaches:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u00a0ScImpulse, WeMake and City of Milano focus on an engaging offline experience for participants. Conveners take notes, photos etc. They then editorialize them and upload them onto the platform.</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders focus on offering people with good stories help for them to put them on the platform. Workshops are organized not by Edgeryders itself (though we do take part), but by active community members. The same also provide most of the help.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nBoth methods are hard. Both have drawbacks.\n\nThe first method is mostly failing. It is difficult to make sense of notes taken during the meeting. I had this experience during \"Taking care\", where I volunteered to take notes with Cristina. Afterwards, I could interpret my notes, but not hers (though we were using the same \u00a0Google Doc! ). I imagine the opposite was true for her. Many notes never make it online. Those that do take the form of a report: \"A said this, B said that\". The community tends not to engage with this type of format.\u00a0\n\nThe second method has given better results.\u00a0\u00a0Still,\u00a0it discourages people who are not good communicators in writing, face language barriers etc.\u00a0\n\nHow to move forward? The Milan meeting gave us two promising leads.\n\nThe first one was offered by @costantino and @alessandrocontini . They pointed out that the mechanics of makers collaboration is not so social. You go to the forum, ask a question, get a pointer, solve the problem and move on. It may be difficult to track it through an online forum.\n\nThe second one results from\u00a0something interesting that happened during \"Taking care\". This: people in the Bordeaux group at some point felt their contribution was unnecessary and possibly unwelcome. They withdrew from the workshop and moved to a different room. They kept working on opencare, but in the form of writing code to look at the conversation.\u00a0\n\nThis resonates with an Edgeryders\u00a0conversation thread\u00a0that predates opencare.\u00a0It says this: the \"meeting\"\u00a0or \"assembly\" format claims to be inclusive, but in fact it is not. Instead, it rewards extrovert, confident, even narcissistic personalities. Introverts don't like to speak in public,\u00a0certainly not without thinking things through. So they never speak. This issue has come to the fore in the hacker community, where many skilled developers identify as intros. Intros like online, where they can take time to think things through, and where they do not have to interrupt others to claim space.\u00a0See for example\u00a0<a href=\"/t/an-expat-in-bucharest-why-collaboration-is-essential-for-social-entrepreneurship-to-thrive/4536/3\">this great comment</a>\u00a0by @trythis\u00a0and the thread that comes with it. As a result, offline spaces are exclusionary. They do not know it...\u00a0because they exclude\u00a0the people who never speak up.\u00a0\n\nThe post-it workshop format has a\u00a0second potential problem. It has no space for\u00a0contributions\u00a0in\u00a0forms other than the speech (as Cicero describes in\u00a0<em>De Oratore</em>). The role of facilitators is to \"standardize\" contributions. Some people (like @Noemi in \"Taking care\") feel that this negates serendipity and predetermines results.\n\nIf this is true, a lot of design-based methods of engagement have a serious flaw. What's worse, an\u00a0<em>unacknowledged</em>\u00a0one. Given their popularity, this is serious.\n\nSo, I propose we\u00a0\"go deep\", doing research and producing one or more papers on:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>An ethnography of makers collaboration</strong>. How important is the space? How important is StackOverflow or similar? What constitues \"good\" collaboration (Alessandro: \"the less interactive and more efficient, the better\")?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>A model of the interface between online and\u00a0offline collaboration</strong>. We promised to build this anyway in the proposal.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A critique of the post-it workshop as a technique for collective intelligence</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAll of this should, in my opinion, have a <em>design</em> perspective. I propose that @Ezio_Manzini coordinates the activities and writes one or two papers under items 2 and 3.\u00a0ER would be happy to support this.\u00a0And I would love to see WeMake and ScImpulse appoint an ethnographer to look into item 1.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-13 17:53:30", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 09:27:58.951044", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 772, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13179, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5064, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Ok keep both</b>\n\nOk then, so you don't have a strong preference for either.

It's true, we never initiated a public protest or a petition regarding the issue, but that's exactly what's most frustrating about communication, as an organisation our efforts alone are never enough.</span>\n\n<span><span>In contrast to this case, we were able to get a letter of support for our latest Pedestrian Art Project in two days, when it usually takes up to ten working days just to review a project. The official request from the Swiss Embassy, who is our donor for this project was good enough to speed up the process. Moreover,\u00a0<span>Tbilisi Development Department of the Municipality</span> invited us for a meeting regarding the project, they \"want to be part of it\", implying, that they would like to give out free T-shirts and flash drives with the municipality logos to the winning artists in front of cameras :) </span><span>We rejected the offer and suggested instead, that the municipality can get involved by addressing the issues of the three most problematic pedestrian areas we chose for the project.

Unfortunately, we have heard nothing back from the Development department since. <span>The main purpose of our latest project was to stress the importance of functioning, attractive and human oriented public spaces, any suggestions on further pressure points would be very helpful.

It's like therapy, but peer to peer and free of charge :)  \u201cShare your Ryde\u201d mission is available <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bootcamp/share-your-ryde\">here</a> and contains instructions on how to think of your story so that it's easier to put it in writing.</li>\n\n<li>Second, and especially if you already completed this mission, you can make a point by leaving comments to what others have said about their own transition; this way you can either relate to their experience and validate it, or you can argue differently; you can also make an additional point so that the story is more informative for future policy. These interactions are particularly relevant because they aggregate stories or open the floor for debates - a sign of an ongoing, collaborative effort in putting forward good proposals for change. If you haven't signed up already you can do it <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/user/register/\">here</a>.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe more you participate at this stage, either by posting your story or commenting on others, the richer this exercise will turn out, and eventually the more substantive Edgeryders' contribution will be in the policy change process.\n\n\u00a0", "created_at": "2011-11-21 09:09:42", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 14:10:47.380319", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 571, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5064, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 5031, "post_number": 1, "raw": "See pdf\u00a0<span>\u2193</span>\n\nfile_fid:14852 -", "created_at": "2015-12-03 11:14:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.315189", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25598, "user_id": 3433, "topic_id": 6028, "post_number": 14, "raw": "No worries Alex, hope your recovery is speedy.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-21 12:09:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.407739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25558], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22676, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 3145, "post_number": 8, "raw": "great :).....and it seems that Tbilisi has nice scenery as well , can't wait :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-16 20:50:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.128548", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22236], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13982, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4548, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Feedback</b>\n\nHi Anna,\n\nthanks for this.

Perhaps they are exceptionally good at engaging people who do not usually interact with documentary photography? Perhaps they have a great skillsharing methodology? Perhaps they have influenced or shaped public attitudes towards women?\n\nHelp us see what you see in their work, and in the way they work.\n\nPerhaps they have clues for others as to how you can economically sustain creative work in new ways? Do they have any plans for how to become independent from grants or what do they do if and when grants don't materialise?\n\nI see there is something about the schoolkids, why did they choose to go there?

The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.\n\nThe first time we visited I was surprised how \u201egood\u201c the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view).\u00a0\n\nThe ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt\u00a0to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling.\u00a0Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room\u00a0(familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).\n\nUsually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories.\u00a0\n\nFirstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.\n\nThe Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying \u201eK\u00fchlschrank\u201c. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored\u00a0there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official \u201emeals\u201c. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way!\u00a0\n\nAnother interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.\n\nAlso very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.\n\nBerivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.\n\nAnother very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.\n\nAlso they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.\n\nBut still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.\n\n<strong>There was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. </strong>Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore.\u00a0What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-16 17:24:04", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 15:41:10.227581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 754, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 562, "user_id": 3528, "topic_id": 529, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Mary Ellen Copeland says about hope that \u2013 People who experience mental health difficulties can get well, stay well and go on to meet their life dreams and goals.\n\nI had a very happy childhood. I went to a rural all boys National School and was in a small class of 8 boys. My memories of that time are mostly of playing lots of sports and having the craic (Irish word for fun) with my fellow students. There was no bullying whatsoever, indeed bullying was something I didn\u2019t know existed until I went to secondary school. This period in my life was the classic definition of Childhood Innocence.\n\nFrom my first year in secondary school I was quite successful academically. Even though I was quite happy at school I found the weekends and holidays from school difficult. I would never see my classmates at the weekends or at Christmas, Easter or summer holidays. This was the start of the first time I ever felt feelings of depression. It was before the time of email, or mobile phones or social media. These times were times of complete and utter isolation from my friends. In these dismal days I used to study hard, write melancholic poetry and just postpone my happiness to when I would be finished my Leaving Cert (Irish exams) and be able to escape to a distant University. I did feel the presence of Hope. I felt I could suffer and suffer during those teenage years and that things would be better when I moved on to University. Where did my hope stem from? I was very academic and had dreams of becoming a mathematician or a poet or a political activist. I fantasised about being as prolific and brilliant as Yeats or Da Vinci.\n\nWhen I was awarded a place in Engineering in Trinity I moved to Dublin. I was unhappy with my Engineering course and after a few weeks stopped attending and instead just led a party life, drinking for the first time. I started to feel very isolated and depressed but I didn\u2019t tell my family or friends the true extent of my feelings.\n\nI recall writing very black poetry at this time and feeling a strong sense of failure.\u00a0 At that end of term I formally withdrew from the Engineering course and returned to home in Galway.\n\nWhile I was in Dublin I met Deirdre who was studying the same course as me. From the first meeting we hit it off and developed a very strong platonic relationship. Even though we both would end up being diagnosed with the same bipolar label Deirdre and I never discussed mental health issues. We would go to pubs and gigs together and discuss music, poetry, philosophy and other topics. When I moved back to Galway we corresponded by snail mail, sending each other long handwritten letters and photocopies of poems and inspiring song lyrics. While we didn\u2019t discuss depression or medication Deirdre and I both were able to express to each other how black our lives could feel. I guess you could say we held Hope for each other.\n\nThat Christmas my health deteriorated and I acquired glandular fever. After a short hospital stay I returned home to suffer months of crippling fatigue. I have battled with severe fatigue ever since.\u00a0 I was ill for most of that year and was idle until I won a place in Information Technology in the University in Galway. Even though I was living at home I was very happy to attend this course. I found this University more relaxed and got on very well with my classmates. For some reason I suffered a breakdown during my final term of my degree. I didn\u2019t tell friends or family but had meetings with some of the lecturers to see could I postpone my final exams.\n\nI found my mind was racing and I felt I needed very little sleep. I also used alcohol to help me relax and unwind from the racing thoughts. Since my father was Bipolar my parents recognised these symptoms and persuaded me to see a G.P. to deal with them. After a short meeting with my family G.P. he recognised the classic symptoms of mania and set up an appointment to see a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist whom I saw for 13 years admitted me to hospital.\n\nI suffer from Bipolar 1, meaning I suffer very high highs or mania, and very suicidal lows. When I get my highs medication seems to have very little effect on me. Instead it is a case of spending months in the safe confines of a hospital until the mania subsides. When I have my lows I get very suicidal and on two separate admissions for depression I have had to resort to Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) to treat my severe depression. There is quite a lot of controversy over ECT. I believe that it is a useful treatment of last resort. When a patient is in hospital and has been suicidal and catatonic with depression for many weeks with various medications being tried to no avail then I think ECT should be considered.\n\nIn the past 14 years since my first hospital admission I have had perhaps 4 or 5 admissions for mania and 2 or 3 for depression. Thankfully I have managed to avoid admission to hospital for the past 6 years except for six nights in summer last year.\n\nMany of us have lost loved ones to suicide. The loss is devastating. I lost my father and my friend Deirdre to suicide. My father had been diagnosed with Bipolar and suffered from the condition from middle-age. Looking back I can see the times he was manic or high, singing loudly on the half hour drive to school where he taught every day. I vividly remember during my teenage years his first admission to psychiatric hospital my Dad weeping with happiness when he was released home on leave for a few days at Christmas.\n\nDad snapped one day in school and that was the end of his teaching career. From that point on he had two overdose attempts. He had gone undiagnosed for the physical illness Haemochromatosis for many years and this aggravated his severe arthritis. My father was in severe pain. Unfortunately his Consultant gave him the news that his arthritis was so severe that he wouldn\u2019t be able to have necessary hip or knee replacements. From that point on my father lost all hope and was just biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to carry out his plans. The last time my father left psychiatric hospital for leave before his suicide he had a conversation with his physiatrist with our family present. The psychiatrist was trying to ascertain the risk of self-harm for my father when on home leave. My father said he wouldn\u2019t try an overdose again, not saying he wouldn\u2019t try another method. The psychiatrist said \u201cMaybe it will be third time lucky Liam!\u201d That statement for me sums up how detached some medical professionals can be, maybe it is how they protect themselves. After my father\u2019s suicide things are a blur. It was as if all the happy memories were pulverized. Childhood milestones, holidays, special occasions all faded away. My only remaining image of my father is him with a pained ashen face, his eyes saying I can\u2019t go on. You try to recall happy memories but all you can focus on is the finality of what happened.\n\nWhen you are feeling bad it is not too difficult to let someone else know this, however when you have lost all hope and a torrent of negative thoughts is leading you to actively plan your demise then the real insidious nature of suicide rears its head and the last thing you will consider doing is letting someone know just how lost you feel.\n\nMy friend Deirdre was very successful academically but struggled feeling the engineering course she was doing was cold and soulless. In correspondence back and over we discussed how banal many of the subjects were and did she really want to end up as an engineer instead of something with more soul like a musician or writer. Deirdre took a year out in 3rd year and worked with IBM. She did well with IBM and returned to Trinity to finish her engineering course and did very well graduating with a first class honours degree. After graduating Deirdre and I didn\u2019t stay in contact as much. A bit like my father I remember seeing her visit me when I was in the intensive unit in a psychiatric hospital in Dublin. I could tell she found it very hard to see me so unwell and I felt she must have wondered was there a risk of her becoming so unwell. Even though Deirdre had seen me in hospital she still never would discuss with me her own mental health or her hopes or fears. After many months of being out of contact with Deirdre I tried to get in touch with her. There was no reply to her phone or email address. Thinking she might have changed jobs I did an internet search for her name. To my horror I came across a Memorial website to Deirdre. Phoning her parents they confirmed the tragic news. Her father told me the story of Deirdre\u2019s last days. Deirdre has been suffering low mood and nothing anybody could do seemed to help. Worried for her safely her parents asked her to come home to Wexford to visit them, otherwise they would have to insist on visiting her in Dublin. That weekend they did everything to try to lift her mood, visiting family and friends and going to shops and restaurants. However Deirdre went back to Dublin. That Monday her mother phoned her at lunch time. Deirdre said she was going to lunch with work colleagues. However the truth was Deirdre had taken a huge overdose of medication that morning, months\u2019 worth of medication she has stopped taking. When her boyfriend returned home that evening Deirdre was dead. You can\u2019t do an autopsy into someone\u2019s state of mind. Deidre had a great job, a steady boyfriend and had just bought a new apartment.\n\nSince my teenage years I have had swings from wildly optimistic grandiose hopes to rock bottom loss of all vestiges of hope. Suicidal ideation can prosper in the absence of hope. Luckily during many of the extreme lows I just try and go into hibernation mode, having a strong belief that if I just get through the oncoming weeks and months then things will have to improve.\n\nOn one occasion for some reason I lost this faith in the future. This wasn\u2019t any kind of impulsive plan or drunken depression. Instead I gradually began to see the future without me as a part of it. I got rid of all my books, got rid of all my CDs and records. I closed bank accounts, I cancelled mailing lists. I booked an appointment with Free Legal Aid with the intention of creating a will.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to cause trouble so my plans revolved around how I could plan my demise with the minimum of pain or distress for my family and friends. I didn\u2019t want my family to have to discover me or call emergency services. So, as I thought, logically, I should get into a body-bag beside the morgue in the hospital. I would be discovered by somebody used to dealing with corpses and it would be a short move into the morgue.\n\nI find it hard to think back and know how I escaped from these suicidal plans. There is somehow Hope to be found at rock bottom depths of depression. From that lowest point I resolved to get well and stay well and to throw everything at the problem. I took personal responsibility for my mental health difficulties. Instead of just relying on medication to work on its own I added other tools to the mix. I did a long course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This helped with the crippling anxiety and negative thoughts I suffered from. I began to get a lot more exercise into my life. I walk my dog every day and go to the gym regularly. I did the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) course a few times until it became a regular part of my life and a great tool to help me every day. Supports are very important. I have always had great support from my family and friends. However it can sometimes be very difficult to discuss some of these topics with family and friends and I worry about burning them out by talking about the same old issues over and over. This is why I joined a mutual support mental health group called GROW.\n\nI joined GROW in April 2013. My Cognitive Behavior Therapy nurse had recommended it and felt the structured approach to problem-solving would suit me. I have been a very regular attendee at meetings and have led the meetings a number of times. I also enjoyed attending the weekly coffee meetings and the regional conference. In GROW we believe in providing leadership by taking on even small responsibilities. I have a strong interest in Cinema so I took up the responsibility of organising a weekly cinema outing for GROW members. This was a great success and GROW members from all around the country were able to meet up to enjoy a regular night out. I was thrilled to be asked to present a leadership paper at the National Conference during my first year with GROW. My confidence in my abilities has increased and I gladly took on the role of Group Recorder when the position arose. Because of GROW I gained enough confidence to apply for a volunteering position with Age Action to teach IT to the over 55s.\n\nI was the facilitator of my weekly GROW group for over two years and we hold Hope for each other. Last year I took up the opportunity of attending a creative writing class freely given by Galway writer Rita Ann Higgins primarily for GROW members. Our members got the chance to have their poems and short stories published in a booklet and I enjoyed reciting two of my poems at the GROW National Conference in Galway. During the past few years I have also been involved with Advancing Recovery in Ireland (ARI). Service users like myself have been working with HSE staff, and we have been planning the introduction of Recovery Colleges, Peer Support worker positions and Consumer Panels.\n\nSoon after my initial diagnosis my psychiatrist encouraged me to get involved in mental health advocacy work. It would be 15 years later before I did this and found the benefits of it. Last year I completed 12 weeks of training with 4 hours per week work with the Irish Advocacy Network. I am now in the early stages of serving on one of these Consumer Panels as secretary, representing the views of service users in the Galway mental health area.\n\nI am a co-founder of Cos\u00e1in. A wellness centre based in the city. Cos\u00e1in supports people with mental health challenges in identifying and pursuing their own pathways to recovery. Cos\u00e1in is peer led by people with their own experience of mental health challenges and recovery. We work in groups offering:\n\n- Recovery education\n\n- Recovery through creativity\n\n- Peer support\n\nThis month I completed 7 days of training to be a WRAP facilitator. WRAP is a symptom monitoring, crisis planning and self-help mental health recovery programme. It was first developed by Mary Ellen Copeland in the States and was further developed by a group of people who experience mental health difficulties.\n\nI would like to close by reflecting on an element of Recovery we define in GROW. The road to recovery is not always a smooth journey, even lately I have had very anxious thoughts which threaten to cause me to avoid or abandon enjoyable events I had planned to attend. However in GROW we say although \u201cold irrational feelings may return from time to time\u201d in Recovery \u201cthey do not change your thinking or behavior\u201d.\n\nTo paraphrase Mary Ellen Copeland I feel that I have gotten well, I can stay well and I have confidence that I can go on to meet my life dreams and goals. I have Hope.\n\nThank you.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-10 19:26:54", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:15:39.822275", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2827, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 181.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14302, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3881, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Amen to that</b>\n\n\"More of us involved in the day to day work\"... hard to disagree.

In this context audiences are always a \u2018steward\u2019 of asset value. This R&amp;D project considers how an art institution and collection can be held as a shared asset.\n\nIndependent curator Helen Kaplinsky and artist and director of Islington Mill Maurice Carlin will share their research so far into models for ownership and funding from various industries. Key questions will be thrown out for discussion including:\n\n1)The collection is an asset that has been standardised and is longer reflective of our current economy. What are the new models out there?\n\n2)How might the term \\#temporarycustodianship be interpreted through institutions and collections?\n\n3)In light of the apparent revolution towards a \u2018collaborative commons\u2019 economy in which we are each a cottage industry, owning a share in our energy consumption and production, how do we share whilst avoiding self-exploitation?\n\n<strong><span>Islington Mill: case study for a community of stewards</span></strong>\n\nIndependent curator Helen Kaplinsky and artist and director of <a href=\"http://www.islingtonmill.com/about.php\">Islington Mill</a> Maurice Carlin invite a discussion concerning buildings and community assets arising from their experience working with arts organisation Islington Mill (North-west England).\u00a0 The project has been defined by an approach of \u201copen space architecture\u201d in which the community defines activity within the building. In parallel with the \\#temporarycustodianship, the Islington Mill community are already shared custodians (or stewards) of the building. However, it is currently owned out-right by one individual and they are seeking to transfer the asset of the building over to a shared ownership model which is as yet undefined. As part of this they are researching models that will enable power to be spread across institutions, one example being liquid democracy (utilised by the Pirate Party who run their UK HQ from Islington Mill).\n\nThe following questions will be addressed:\n\n1)What does a steward/ custodian look like?\n\n2)What are the organisational blue prints for retaining a power share across a community of custodians/ stewards?\n\n3)How might the question of the building as an asset be considered within the wider ecology of sharing of assets?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-10 13:14:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.385532", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 513, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14682, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6229, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Very relevant!</b>\n\nThis is super-relevant, I am very interested in it.\u00a0\n\nI have to admit I have no idea how you might do this in a rough-and-ready way.

I have been running my own Design business for the past 9 years ever since I have left the corporate hospitality world. I started with my company Design2Style in partnership with my Husband, designing residential &amp; interiors and developing brand design for companies. Over time, my interest and knowledge of design thinking and strategy increased, gaining experience in projects and from attending various conferences on the subject, which resulted in moving forward, evolving personally and professionally. I launched Belgium Design Council, which applies design thinking on the project's infrastructural level. This allowed me to move from aesthetic design to applying design thinking processes in \u2018designing\u2019 communities.\n\nWe're working on several projects at the moment. I've got increasingly interested in Business Improvement District concept over the last couple of years, which existed since the 1960\u2019s/70\u2019s in the Northern America, and concentrated on socio-economical regeneration for business and communities as a whole. The combination of a geographical zone including businesses, community, people and the collaboration of those elements creating successful public, private and citizen partnerships, in order to enhance people's lives and environments. Creating sustainable socio/economic regeneration. BIDs and similar partnerships have been launched around the world - in Sweden, Scotland, Germany, England - and one of them is our non-profit organization of BIDs Belgium. We're also planning to launch BID EU in the near future, in order to create a platform for sharing best practices with each other and filter these down to ground level. I'm planning to concentrate on specific target groups - besides the regular social innovation aspect, there will also be the social inclusion of elderly, youth, special needs people and on ways in which we can involve them and make them feel more as a part of the community. There is a plan for the pilot version to be launched in September in my own community in Brussels, Koekelberg, in collaboration with the municipality. We will address the project to both 300 businesses of this district and 3 other neighboring districts.\n\nWe have also been developing and presenting the general information and interactive sessions for the BIDs in Brussels. We invited architects, developers, retailers, freelancers and members of the communities and explained the concept, but also ask them for feedback. There has\u00a0been positive feedback and some are really keen on implementing, but they need guidance - and we want to prepare and adapt the framework which has been shared by other BID countries, which would be useful and simplify the launching of BIDs across Belgium. The model works this way: by defining the geographical zone, having a collaborative approach to working together as a community, whilst addressing the issue that is of priority and defining the projects for that area. BIDs can be supported by a levy that business owners, citizens, and the municipality contributes to. Crowd-funding has also been used to support local projects. Some cities have it already in Belgium, albeit these are a slightly different models - Mechelen and Ghent for example. The BID is a non-profit organization, with a task force representation with an open source, collaborative and transparent approach and it needs to be inclusive of the Open Care element.\n\nI also have a personal project close to my heart - in which Belgium Design Council works on also. It's about special needs children. As there is a personal background to it - one of my sons is nearly 11 yrs old and\u00a0is autistic, with emotional and behavior regulation challenges. As we have been dealing with this since he was 2 yrs old, I have observed there is a big gap between what's available on the grassroots level for parents and at an institutional level. There is no support in the communities for parents with children with special needs for example. This personal project is about injecting more tools and awareness with creating more inclusive care in the communities themselves - also by using design thinking and visual tools, beyond pictograms available online. I have realized how much sensory input and additional energy my son needs and how much its presence could help him move around and understand things better - and visual designers and illustrators could greatly help such children. As Belgium Design Council we are planning now to fill this gap - one way is to work with the schools where children with special attend. \u00a0Our son will be changing to a further\u00a0specialised school closer to our\u00a0home now. I have spoken\u00a0with the principal\u00a0and he is very interested some of the creative\u00a0inclusive projects I have suggested,\u00a0but the school has\u00a0no time to initiate these - I have the experience and the knowledge and wish gather some support from other parents and see if we can move forward. Same for the people in the municipality, who are very much interested in this kind of work.\n\nMy Husband and I are also heavily involved in another nonprofit organization in Brussels and volunteer at a local football club, with over 300 youth from various backgrounds. We also have a goal of making this youth more inclusive and open - both for children with special needs, but also for refugees, who get refused from other football clubs around the city for example. We will introduce the first refugee children into the club for the coming season, which we are very proud of, as we see this as part of the wider community work we are involved in.\n\nIt seems to me that the initiatives, such as BIDs, should, in fact, be initiated by the city itself - and whenever I speak with the politicians, they understand it but resources and knowledge bases are at times limited. It can be challenging when systems and organizations need to change, understand and adopt design thinking themselves in order to be open for such initiatives and collaborations between private, public and citizens. The concept and ideas can appear too complicated, too political, too new and disruptive, yet many cities around the world are seeing the value this can bring.\n\nThis is why we decided to be active citizens, to get involved in various initiatives we are working on, pulling in our network and knowledge base - and turn things around by, inspiring, collaborating and sharing information, including enlisting more volunteers from the football club to the BIDs projects, showing that non-hierarchical organisations welcome everyone. It's important to talk, share, bring people together, because it's part of the process of change - and this is where OpenCare comes as a partner.\n\n<strong><em>Do you design better communities yourself?

Bear with me, this is going to go deep.\n\nI was raised in a soft-left, Labour-leaning Scottish working class household. On benefits. There's a simple, basic class alligience there which is made considerably more complicated by the radical right wing (and that's Indian right wing, Hindu nationalism!) of my father.\n\nAs I grew older, I moved through four distinct political phases: Moderate Left, Libertarian, Anarchist and Gandhian. I'm now in a political territory which does not have good names or widespread understanding, but I'm beginning to see a coalescence in a rather unusual direction which challenges my \"Political Lone Wolf\" tendencies.\n\nI became a <strong>Libertarian </strong>when a good friend, of course an American, said to me \"Socialism requires a central government with arbitrary powers.\" It's a simple statement, but I was in a position to hear it: with sudden insight, I realized that a limited government could not respond to all the needs of the people in all situations, breaking the basic rules of engagement on which socialism was built. \"From each according to their abilities to each according to their needs\" requires a government that can react to an almost infinite spectrum of responses, and what if something goes wrong, and that infinite flexibility with State power becomes intrusive... or worse. The limits on \"need\" are not known, and if the State is going to serve, there can be no clear limits on its reach. It's a simple argument, but boils down to this: each limit on the State will limit its ability to help, as well as harm, and if you assume the State is benign, you ignore the lessons of history, and if you assume limits to the power of the State, you can no longer assume functional socialism in all circumstances. In the limit, it is Limited Government (clearly necessary from recent history) or Socialism.\n\n<h2><strong>I became a Libertarian. I chose Limited Government.</strong></h2>I became an <strong>Anarchist</strong> when I realized that Capitalism, as I understood it, was created by the State. The four main supports of Capitalism are all State-funded supports for business - largely paid for by taxing the income of individuals, rather than companies. Those four main supports are:\n\n* <strong>Limited Liability</strong>, where the State protects the Owners of companies from any Debts (including, say, legal settlements for malpractice) incurred by the Companies. This is, essentially, a free (and massive!) insurance policy written by the State to Investors.\n\n* <strong>Property Rights Enforcement</strong>, in the form of both Policing and the Military. While ordinary people benefit from this activity, the richer you are, the more you benefit, in a completely non-linear way. By ensuring a set of rules to the game in which property, in any concentration is sacrosanct, the State subsidises the rich more than it subsidises the poor.\n\n* <strong>The Welfare State</strong>, where the State picks up the pieces where Capitalism fails to provide for people, and thereby nullifies much of the pressure on Capitalism to actually do the job it proposes to do (make everybody richer in an efficient way) by virtue of stepping in where the Market would starve people to death and filling in the gap. This is a subsidy which has effectively prevented political change for generations, for right or wrong.\n\n* <strong>Money Supply</strong>, in which the State (in most cases) borrows money into existence from banks, and then pays then back, with compound interest. The Fiat (State) grant which allows a bank with \u00a3100 in reserves to lend \u00a31500, and keep the total repaid, is literally a license to print money. If an individual did this, it would be a crime, but the ability to commit this miracle of turning two loaves and five fishes into a meal for five thousand is accomplished through the power of ignorance and greed.\n\nIt's important to note that a State subsidy can be of two sorts. The first is easy to see, it is simple <strong>Redistribution</strong>, where taxes are raised on one person and paid to another. Arguing about this kind of activity makes up the majority of politics, but it is <strong>a tiny percentage of the actual subsidy the State generates</strong>. There is no way to avoid the smokescreen of focussing on government spending, rather than goverment use of Power, in conventional political discourse. But the second class of subsidy dwarfs the first: <strong>Legislation, or Control of the Rules of the Game</strong>. My mandating compound interest, copyright, patent, indefinite land tenure, a single currency, limited liability, limits to collective bargaining, policing paid for from central government taxes rather than (say) local property taxes and fifty other things, the government moves enormous sums from one pocket to another without every touching the money itself. It simply tilts the board in favor of those it wishes to win, and then suggests that the game is fair because everybody is playing by the same rules. Yes, yes, but those rules were written to ensure that one set of players wins, and the fact they are the same for everybody does not change that only some people own land, own companies, and can maintain the legal costs of making the system work to their advantage. A medical system in which everybody pays the same amount for an operation will save the rich and not the poor, and yet by the standards of many of Government's other activities, is seen as Fair.\n\nSo what I understood was that, actually, Capitalism was not \"Free Enterprise\" - in fact it had nothng at all to do with Freedom. Rather, vast State power was deployed to support an enterprise in which one had Free Choice with Limited Options, and where certain activities enjoyed massive State support, while other activities which were equally productive and worthy to my eye were marginalized or policed out of existence. The game was, in short, rigged in a manner much like the Marxist analysis (!) but to which Marx offered no solutions because the evil that men do is multiplied by access to power, and we have yet to find a good way to keep evil people from occasionally siezing control of the power of the State and using it to smash the world to pieces from time to time. The more you concentrate power, the worse this occasional failure can be.\n\nMy final break with Libertarianism came when I re-examined, from this perspective, what the State is. I'd been using Max Weber's definition for years \"The State is the sole entity which maintains the monopoly on legitimate physical coercion.\"\n\nBut this definition chafed. I could not wrap my head around edge cases like Gaza or Iraq where there were three, four, five State-like actors duking it out, none with a monopoly, but all working much as States do, on the same soil, with multiple chains of authority connected to the same people in many cases, Power nested like Russian Dolls around the souls of the people. There was no way I could square this with Weber's work. So I came up with my own definition of the State, namely:\n\n\"A State is any entity which can retroactively grant immunity for criminal behavior.\" In short, if you kill somebody, and something steps in to protect you after-the-fact, that Somebody is the State or its agent. This privileges Jurisdiction over Sovereignty (over some patch of land) and accurately reflects the lived reality of areas in which multiple States are in conflict over authority, where no legitimate monopoly on violence has been established (e.g. there are three police forces on the streets, all mutually hostile) but where key players in each State-candidate political unit are legally (or practically) immune from criminal prosecution from either either own or other State-candidate entities. In short, in Iraq, if you were Sunni leadership, Shia leadership, American contractors, Iraqi government police or a member of some other groups, you could get away with Murder, and nobody would effectively prosecute you. Many competing groups were capable of offering protection to those committing criminal acts, and my definition of the State accurately speaks to that experience in a way that Weber's never will. Furthermore, it also explains crisply how the State creates the Army and the Police and Doctors and Tax Collectors and various other professions. The Army is immunized against Murder charges as long as they are obeying the Chain of Command. The Police are immunized against Assault charges, as long as they are envorcing other law. Doctors are immunized from assault and murder and other charges as long as they are obeying good medical practice. Tax collectors are immunized from theft charges (which is what they are clearly doing much of the time) as long as they are siezing assets on behalf of the State in prescribed ways. It is limited grants for otherwise-criminal behavior which defines the State, not the monopoly on violence.\n\n<h2>I became an anarchist. I chose a Stateless society.</h2>I became a Gandhian through a more subtle process. I started to try and figure out how you could actually have a Stateless society that worked. I'm from a medical background (my father, a doctor, my mother, a nurse) so my mind was naturally shaped by epidemeological and caring models. I wanted to envisage and work towards a society in which public health was good, and people were happy. These are simple goals to express, albeit far from the heart of most political theory and doctrine, and I wanted to understand how to get there. Gandhi's attitude to war (<strong>nonviolence at all costs!</strong>) is what he is best remembered for, but it's Gandhian economics which is the Jewel in the Crown of Gandhian thinking.\n\nGandhian economics (note that it's not Ghandi - even very politically literate people habitually make that error) is the economics of local, recirculating wealth. Gandhi was acutely aware of the fact the British were in India as looters, to strip the wealth from the society and export it, and stopping this looting was an integral part of his strategy. But, in fact, the idea of \"keeping what you make\" is close to Libertarianism, integral (no doubt about this) to Anarchism (depending on the nature of the goods, of course...) and Gandhi's model is uniquely Indian in its inception - when Gandhi says \"local\" he means \"embedded in an extended family, a family of such families, bound together by mutual obligation.\" This is at the heart of Western misreadings of Gandhi - he was far from asexual (a tantric, even a celibate one, is not asexual) and his model of society was built on the matrix of mutual obligations which is the core of the Hindu body politic, extended to include those who are not full members of the groups which control local resources. Gandhi wanted to extend the extended family to include everybody, but crucially, face-to-face, daily-contact responsibility for the poor and needy on your doorstep, for the working man who brings you your rice, for the doctor who sees your children, was Gandhi's model. You might call Gandhi's vision of the world <strong>Individual Socialism</strong>, where the matrix of mutual obligations which comprise Indian society at its best is extended to include everybody - we are all obligated to help each-other, without State coercion in the vast majority of cases, and so the world runs.\n\nIt's easy to read Gandhi as a Libertarian Leftist, and I made this mistake myself for years, because I had not fully factored the degree to which Gandhi was building on Indian models of social obligation (and, indeed caste dharma) to build a society. But it all came back to water, to sanitation, to power, to <strong>infrastructure</strong>, and it's in this perspective that I found my way.\n\nThe most tangible benefit of being a member of a developed world State is infrastructure: water, sanitation, power, roads, all that stuff just works and is damn cheap. People in the poorer countries pay 10x or 100x as much for clean drinking water as we do, because Western states are really good at infrastructure. But does this mean we're doomed to big central governments as the only way to provide the infrastructure which makes a good standard of living affordable to everybody?\n\nWhen I first thought about this as a political problem, I could not get anywhere. But I am an engineer and it's in engineering that I finally found a political synethsis I could believe in.\n\nGandhi was a designer. The spinning wheel for which he was famous is a political object, which works in three ways.\n\n* Firstly, it keeps the price of cloth high and distributes the income from making cloth to individual people spinning. Gandhi wore the loincloth (rather than a suit) to show that if you could only afford a little cloth because the hand-spun stuff was so expensive, that was fine.\n\n* Secondly, the spinning wheel was Free, it was a design which had originated in a competition for a new spinning wheel, which Gandhi then adapted and modified, and which anybody with the skills could manufacture without patent or copyright concerns. It was a tool Of the People, By the People, For the People. It was Freedom, of a material kind.\n\n* Thirdly, it was sustainable, it used nothing which was imported, it used nothing which was not abundant, it used nothing which could not be replaced. From end to end, the manual spinning of cloth was an organic, indiginous activity with this tooling, quite unlike the far-off Mills of Manchester with their coal-and-iron spinning infrastructure.\n\nAnd that it when it clicked for me: infrastructure shapes our political options, it shapes the playing field in incredibly deep ways. Deeper that government, the material base of the society shapes the structure of our lives.\n\nMarxism sees Capital, Labour and Talent fighting for their shares of the rewards of Industrial Manufacturing. It's a model, but an incomplete one.\n\nGeorgism sees Capital, Labour, and Talent too, but also takes into account Landlords and Monopolies, which gives a further, wider picture.\n\nBut both of these models assume a manufacturing base which greatly rewards large scale and centralization, and the Gandhian model (which I'll call Individual Socialism a few lines longer) assumes that you can use a Legislative Subsidy (banning factories, essentially) to produce a better wealth distribution, in exactly the same way that Capitalism uses a Legislative Subsidy (in the form of limited liablity) to produce a worse wealth distribution, to pack the resources at the top.\n\nAnd this became the four turning of the wheel: Infrastructure-Centric politics. I spent a long time writing and thinking about this, producing models like <a href=\"http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/other/the-free-city-state-2359\">The Free City State</a> and <a href=\"http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/global/infrastructure_for_anarchists_1155-1155\">Infrastructure for Anarchists </a>which teach infrastructure theory as a core political truth, literally as the substrate of society, and examine how different styles of engineering and governance over engineered artefacts could produce a better political structure and thereby better society.\n\nIt was only after several years of this that I realized I was reprising the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=hexayurt&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gl=uk&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=90E6T6jjMYGR0AX397S9Cw&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=512&amp;sei=-0E6T4v9IeOm0QWRraGoCw\">work</a> and <a href=\"http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com\">words</a> of Buckminster Fuller, sometimes to the letter. And that was the political equilibrium at which I remained for several years, plugging away on trying to bulid physical systems, maps and models, to enable a resilient relocalization which would produce high quality of life on practically no natural resources, with the objective of protecting the people from the worse consequences of centralization and authoritarianism, as a first step - no, rather, as a component - of a better future for everyone.\n\n<h2>Then then came the Pirate Party.</h2>I'd given up, completely, on electoral politics. I wanted to exercise my political power using as much leverage as I could possibly find, using my engineering nous to exercise disproportionate impact on the future course of humanity and life on planet earth. At this altitude, the air is pretty thin - there were, for many years, perhaps six people in the world that really understood what I was doing and why, and all of them were busy running similar projects, attempting to steer the globe down a better path by skill and individual expertise. This brain trust was a lonely place.\n\nThen the Pirates came, and my ears pricked up. They seemed to understand tech. They were not anarchists, but nor were they Libertarians - a sophisticated discourse about individual liberty and common goods, first in non-scarce areas like knowledge, but with a sophistication that spoke to the clear possibility of extending this kind of savvy into new areas, like perhaps (in the long run) taking an intelligent new approach on land rights, sustainability and environmentalism.\n\nIn short, people were beginning to think about politics in a way that I recognized as genuinely fresh, novel and intelligent, and I began to do some research, wrote a short, informal manifesto, and joined. In that order.\n\nAnd then they <strong>won 10% of the votes in German elections</strong>. And this rocked me to the core.\n\nI'd implicitly given up on electoral democracy as a route to sane governnance. The track record was so bad in every country I'd lived in that I had simply abandoned hope that there was any way for me to express my political will through the matrix of a political party and not walk away with utter nonsense for results. The tiny fringe parties which might have been closest to my goals were banished to perpetual irrelevance in the First Past the Post, winner take all electoral systems of Britain and America.\n\nBut in Germany, the Pirates were winning.\n\nSo I rejoined the UK Pirate Party, with an eye on helping move us towards a showing in the European elections, and took a role uniquely suited to my talents.\n\nI am the Defence Policy Working Group leader for the UK Pirate Party. I've gone from being a political radical in the wilderness to a small part of a Party Machine because, at last, a political party which shared enough of my beliefs and values to make common cause with arose, and that party is credible enough to command substantial popular support in major global powers.\n\nThere's a new dawn coming, because the Pirate Party has <strong>astonishing </strong>demographics in under-30s, and the US copyright lobby is going down with the ship as the US hemorrhages political credibility and good-will globally, making breaking the Internet on Hollywood's behalf less attractive with each passing day.\n\nIn short: finally I've re-enlisted in Democracy as a route to real political change, and I have the Pirate Party to thank for that. Thanks are due to Falkvinge for daring to do the impossible, and I'm proud to be able to do a little to help.\n\n<strong>I might even run for election one day, but that's a topic for another post.</strong>\n\nYo ho ho!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-14 11:35:27", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:13:36.160700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3762, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18233, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4022, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>I'm still interested</b>\n\nLove the idea, and thanks for giving it another thought after the Lote4 attempt.

Experience has shown that tents and lean-tos made of tarpaulins simply blow away during the monsoon thunderstorms that have begun to hit with increasing frequency. We followed your lead on potential sources of Corrugated Galvanized Iron (CGI) sheets, as well as lighter plastic versions of corrugated roofing sheets, and we were offered a wonderful price by a company in Fushan, China, who wanted to help the victims of the earthquake disaster. However, The company in China did not want to take responsibility for shipping the roofing sheets into Nepal due to the chaotic conditions and damaged roadways there. In the end, after looking into shipping and weighing in the time needed for delivery as well as the cost, we decided to go with a local supplier of metal CGI sheets. (We will go with the Chinese supplier as soon as shipping becomes feasable. Maybe in the permanent shelter phase of recovery. We were able to purchase 60 bundles of 12 sheets, which is enough for about 60 shelters. Unfortunately, that leaves 800 families in the same community sitting under the sky in the heat and the thunderstorms.

Your point about field rock being their most abundant building resource gave me pause... Maybe it is difficult to dig up dirt that is not full of rocks there. More research is needed to make sure that such a dirt-rock mixture can be used in superadobe construction. The Tencate suggestion seems like a valuable lead.\n\nWe had tried to implement hexayurts after the Jure landslide disaster, but ran into the problem of complying with the stringent anti earthquake building regulations in Nepal. We had an engineer volunteering to modify the hexayurt design to make it earthquake-proof, but that did not go anywhere. Kind of ironic.\n\nAnyway, in the meanwhile, people in the Dhuskun area of Sindhulpachok are getting food aid and some tarpaulins from a group of nonprofits.Unfortunately, the tarpaulins have been blowing away in the monsoon thunderstorms. Madhav has been helping to distribute the aid. Here are two photos from that endeavor.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11013160_10204384962806939_2972278250109526013_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10339776_902072166520557_7722319380581446955_n-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n<span>Today, a group of Nepali nonprofits have assembled with the CGI sheets from Communtiy Service of Nepal and 100 building experts, to take the CGI sheets and incorporate them into shelter for the chosen 60 families of the community.

We are writing letters to celebrities, governments, businesses, anyone we can think of, but so far no offers of help have come in, except for the roofing manufacturer in Fushan, China. I was not even able to get a quote from DHL on shipping the roofing materials into Nepal, however. I have learned from past experience that there are only a few companies that can ship reliably into Nepal. I sent Madhav a camera last year, and it disappeared out of the mail service before it got there.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-28 08:33:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.822044", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 874, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11472, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5877, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nSee if that works better.

No one can ensure a 100% holistic approach, but you can already get a lot further by having this intention. In the end research today might state that milk (just as an example) is bad for us and tomorrow another research might state the opposite.

Another question is how does it affect the amount of permanent contracts. Also after-war neoliberalism ideology was mentioned. Me, Nadia and Jonathan were duscussing almost the same thing a while ago: what is perception of reality do unemployed people have? WHY can't they find a job?\n\nSummary about young people and labour market relations was quite short, but still gave me some ideas and a bit of confidence in which way should we work.\n\nAlso, they can be good start points for discussion.\n\nSo, does anyone of you have anyhing to say about, for example, perception of working reality? Is lack of trust in labour market a new ideology? If you were observing your friends for a while, maybe.\n\nI can say that hear \"I don't know what to do with my life\" and \"I'm not sure if I can become part of this system\" very often from surprisingly smart people.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-19 11:13:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.984670", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 280, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21725, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1289, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>The 3 components of participation</b>\n\n\"Lack of reward at the individual level\", this applies everywhere in our societies, both in businesses and in government institutions (not just to the Occupy movement).\n\nThere is a glaring lack of recognition of employees and citizens in our societies, because the current leadership model, instead of being on the BRIGHT side, is based on the DARK side, with values that do not support recognition of individuals (like selfishness, greed, powerful need for control, arrogance, feeling of superiority, ignorance of failure, difficulty to delegate, agressivity, fear of change, betrayal, insensivity, emotional fireworks, perfectionism, etc.).\n\nOrganizational fit leaders tend to hire people with similar values, which means that good candidates with dissimilar values do not get hired. To fix the \u201cfit\u201d problem, businesses and governments must be willing to hire people with diverse values. They must then learn to act on those values. Providing leaders with insight about behaviors that may alienate their entourage is a possible way to reduce their counterproductive tendencies. It is possible, through coaching, to teach leaders how to cope with stress and therefore minimize the impact of their behavior.\n\nBecause dark side tendencies are deeply ingrained habits, it takes a concerted effort to minimize these tendencies. However, not all types of leaders can be \"coached\". Some types will remain permanently locked in they habits. They say they will change when they have no real intention of doing so. With these types of personality, it is best to replace them.\n\nAre Occupy participants happy and proud about their experience?\n\nTo be truly \"happy\", the process of empowerment should have been completed. Alberto rightly points out that in the case of Occupy participants, there is a lack of recognition, lack of reward.\n\nSelf-power, or empowerment, develops in interaction with others. The process of developing the power to act allows the passage of a state of inability to act on what is important for an individual (or a community) to a state of \"power to act\". This process can take place through participation and mobilization.\n\nHowever, there are several components to participation.\n\nThe first two components of participation, self-esteem and critical awareness, were probably developed by Occupy participants. Whereas, the third component of participation, acquisition of practical skills (through among other recognition of their skills), was probably not met. Moreover, they did not see the results of their actions. Many participants may have developed resentment (ie not \"happy\"). A competent community was not put in place, efforts of participants did not contribute to alter the systems to meet the needs of individuals, and allow these individuals to use these systems effectively.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-26 14:20:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.979083", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 458, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32472, "user_id": 47, "topic_id": 1022, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>so a track? :)</b>\n\nHow do we go about setting up a track for that?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-24 12:34:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.378084", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4191, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4158, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Step One: Articulating our assumptions and inviting others to do the same</h2>\n\n<strong><i>Below is the list we started building during our first skype call.

Some quick notes.\n\nMarocco has a system of generous unemployment benefits. In the town where I am right now, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarfaya\">Tarfaya</a>, it is the main source of income for large swaths of the population. I have been told that it is the government's attempt to keep rebellion at bay in parts of the country. (That could it be in response to the Arab spring? Don't know, need to find out.) This has several adverse effects as it dis-incentivises people from working. I have found the work ethics in this town (where we currently are) to be \"so-so\". People keep <em>inshalla</em>h-ing about everything and take a lax attitude to getting things done. Perhaps it is because of the subsidies, perhaps everything is just slower in the desert :-) If we are to do anything here we will not be able to rely on local collaborators.\n\nThere are several immediately visible and possibly actionable problems which could be good calls to action / areas of focus for incubated projects. (Because success at tackling them will be visible fairly soon?):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Crazy high sugar consumption as well as high prevalence of diabetes</strong> (need to check whether it's Type A or Type B). The main culprit? Moroccan Tea. It's the key social ceremony, you cannot walk past any group of acquaintances without being offered, and having to drink, it. And people put in insane amounts of white processed sugar.At the same time they all have at least one family member who has diabetes. Perhaps they have been told that they are correlated. But several people whom I spoke to seemed to have no idea about the consequences of excessive consumption of sugar, especially the white processed kind.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Chronically bored teens, hash addiction and lack of initiative.</strong> The most active crew are the surfers. I guess it makes sense, you have to be disciplined to practice a sport like surfing since it's equipment intensive, weather dependent and hard.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Surfing and water sports</strong> in general are interesting for our initiative because there are many interesting projects with commercial potential which we could incubate in the residencies. E.g. production of surf boards from mycelium and recuperated plastic bottles (which litter the city and beach). Tarfaya is great for surfing. Which means market opportunities for certain kinds of cottage industries.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tourism.</strong> Also, it looks like the new ferry service connecting Tarfaya port with others including the Canary Islands. This will mean tourism. There is literally no infrastructure for tourism, we could get in there and quickly set the foundations for sustainable tourism businesses if we move quickly.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Agriculture and food.</strong> We found two interesting possible allies / mentors. Frederi is a French guy who is a biologist (I think) and has a lot of experience with setting up commercially viable small scale agriculture/food businesses. He wants to set up an agriculture venture in the desert - but cannot get the permit without political backing and 80k in a moroccan bank as a deposit. Very experienced and could be possible partner for fundraising. Second is Dr. Issam Boucholy who is a pharmaceutical doctor and has developed cheap rapid-testing kits for different diseases including HIV and Diabetes. He also tried setting up a local spirulina production plant, but the equipment was saboutaged by vandals. Is from Casablanca but a Tarfaya resident since over 10 years. Pretty much a biohacker and entrepreneurial - possible local mentor in the residency program.\n\n(It's Frederi's house we could rent for 300 Eur per month. We could possibly also do a deal where we do a non monetary exchange - we help with some renovation of his house while we use it (ideally rent free) and he helps with setting up some kind of revenue stream to finance the space and generate income for Edgeryders.) E.g. he mentioned that the demand, and willingness to pay for,  for organic food in the main cities in Maroc is comparable to that in Western Europe. So it could be a nice partnership. Frederi likes us and the OpenVillage project. If and when the ferries start running (people say September 1, but you never know) then he wants to move to Tarfaya permanently as the French Reunion islands where he lives are turning from a tropical paradise to a crazy commercialised consumption space with the entry of large chains like Carrefour. So his interests are aligned with ours. OpenSource Hardware for agricultural / food production starts to get interesting as land is dirt cheap, you have loads of water and sunshine.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Microbrewery.</strong> A potentially high return on investment venture is microbrewery. Because for the alternative of importing alcohol, you need a 3 million EUR license. Which is still profitable according to a canarian hotel owner we have befriended. You can count on 3 EUR a cup, which is a lot of money in local context. If you brew your own locally? Well :)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAfter having thought about this a lot I think it would be wise to just make a decision to set the space here <em>starting now</em> and running for the duration of the project and a couple of months afterwards. And run a killer party / festival in December here. That will give us a month in town to build social capital, and recruit people into the project at a pace natural to this place. It'll be easy to get people to come here in the winter (weather's much better, sunshine, sea, not crowded, nice escape esp. around Christmas / New Year).\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities to show tangible outcomes and build support for the Reef from unusual sources who want in for different reasons. We have someone on board to set up a biohacking space and convene the bleeding edge around local projects. As we have learned \u2013 get a place that looks amazing on a postcard and you have basically won already. Our outreach infrastructure are the cafes, the beach and the market. Get a stall in the market for very little money (50 USD/month) and run a bunch of activities out of it. Host everyone in the house (300 USD/month). Minimal effort to get a space up and running and focus on producing results.\n\nGIrls and Women. We are going to have to make extra efforts to engage girls and women. The simplest will be setting up a ladies cafe with lots of activities close to their interests. Crafts, Health Science etc.. Engaging Girls from other countries will be a mess if they are religious. They will need separate residency quarters and much more patience in terms of engagement. So with Women I suggest we focus on locals. If/ When we raise sufficient financing we can sort out a space that also works for females from elsewhere in the region (separate sleeping quarters). Another issue is that the girls and women who do show up from other parts of the region and world will have to adapt to the local norms when it comes to behaviour and clothing in public. Modest clothers, no public displays of affection with males etc etc etc.\n\nCan I have a vote on this @zmorda / @hazem / @alberto / @matthias / @johncoate / @noemi ?\n\nOnce we have the proof of concept in place, we can then raise engagement and money for other iteration in different parts of the region and beyond.", "created_at": "2017-07-09 13:58:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:38.498154", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1296, "wiki": false, "reads": 36, "score": 222.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33017, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2888, "post_number": 31, "raw": "<b>Request for Method</b>\n\nIn our meeting this morning <a href=\"/u/fortyfoxes\">@fortyfoxes</a> requested that the method for this process be made clear - here is that method as I understand it and the context in which the process was followed.\n\nContext:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>As a result of optimising and reducing the expenditure of the unMonastery, we were able to save around 10,000 Euro, which meant we can feasibly run the project for an additional 2 months.</li>\n\n<li>This budget allows for 6 funded positions within the unMonastery based on previous calculations.</li>\n\n<li>MT2019 agreed to this and had the decision signed off by the municipality.</li>\n\n<li>Recognising that we needed better support for Italian and better integration locally we targeted the call towards people we had already begun working with or have close contact with.</li>\n\n<li>Given that limited timescale and lessons learnt in the initial selection process it was determined that we should \"hand pick\" individuals that make sense - discussed <a href=\"/t/living-and-working-as-an-unmonk/2813/9\">here</a> with <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>Since we were keen to have some locals join existing unMonks, it made sense to discuss with those unMonks already from Matera how well or badly we'd been doing so far, so to factor it into the process - found <a href=\"/t/living-and-working-as-an-unmonk/2813/25\">here</a>.</li>\n\n<li>We then defined expectations and folded it into the above wiki - so to make clear what the offer was.</li>\n\n<li>Acknowledging that we do not have time to do comprehensive integration nor can we act as a support to existing projects, we framed the invitation for someone who would be a quick starter and who \"gets it\" see 'Conditions' in the wiki.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nProcess and Method.

In groups they came up with amazing ideas and that showed the power of collaboration. After that a lot of people got onto the platform and started engaging, and we understood the whole concept of edgeryders, the idea of co-creation, being open and trying to work with each other\u201d\n\n\u201cpeople were very surprised that this was a UNDP initiative. It was very different for us because mainly for the past years we worked for the government, so it\u2019s mostly top down project implementation or on the policy level. We haven\u2019t worked very much with civil society or individuals, so this was a new experience \u2013directly engaging with the grassroots\u201d\n\n<strong>Challenges along the way</strong>: language issues\n\n<strong>Moving forward</strong>: building a localized platform in Egypt to engage more and more people to work with each other.\n\n<strong>Khatuna:\u00a0\u201cThe main thing for us was to focus on what people are doing, concretely.\"</strong>\n\nThe positive side of STF is that we managed to reach out to you, who are here with us, in a way that led to action without having any follow up in mind, so people didn\u2019t expect to receive anything in terms of monetary contribution \u2013 and we were aware of that -but collaboration came out of it even from these three months. The other interesting thing is cross country collaborations [] for the actors here seeing they\u2019re part of a larger community, not just their country. \u201c\n\n<strong>Challenges: </strong>balancing the methodology and how we work in the 3 countries, adjusting to the local context \u2013eg language issues.\n\n<strong>Moving forward: </strong>we are seeing that people are behind their actions, but how can multinational organisations create a space for multiplying this effort? Or should we, is this our role? There is a clear need for linkage, but what would this be?\n\n<strong>Hasmik:</strong>\n\n<strong>Challenge for Armenia</strong> was also the language issue \u2013 language was kind of a barrier, participants submitted stories and tried to participate in their language.\n\n<strong>Moving forward: </strong>Wants to hear from Edgeryders how to engage the community? One thing is to establish a social innovation platform and say &lt;here we are&gt;, and another is to get people interested in it.\n\n<strong>All 3 country offices acknowledged that Spot the Future gave them an opportunity to engage with those people and organisations beyond the \u201cusual suspects\u201d.</strong> \u201cIn classical UNDP terms, usual suspects are NGOs that we are usually engaging with \u2013 when we need engagement of the civil society we go to them\u201d\n\nThe work with Edgeryders on Spot the Future helped eg UNDP Georgia to make connections with new organisations such as JumpStart, so as an outcome future collaborations will fall naturally in their work.\n\nEdgeryders, however doesn\u2019t want to become a professional representative of the \u201cinnovators\u201d \u2013 like if it were a category. If we are reifying this many will want to get themselves inside a label that sounds great, that incentivizes people to portray themselves in a specific way, often victimizing themselves. But this is not the way forward: \u00a0we spot people who actually do the work, without confining them to a narrow category.\n\n<a href=\"/u/lasindias\">@Grupo Cooperativo de las Indias</a>: \u201cyou cannot eat the bird, look at the other side\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my cooperative we define power as the ability to generate consensus. The problem is that you try do to too much. You try to achieve new social consensus, in a way you step over someone always and you cannot do that \u2013 you work for the UN. A way is to detect the consensus that is undeveloped, and that are many consensus that no one talks about loudly\u201d\n\n@remi\u00a0: \u201cthe high quality presentations and the individual contacts that I\u2019ve made [] I\u2019ll take any chance to participate again in a new opportunity\u201d\n\n@Inge: \u201cthe moment I got sucked into the community I realized their way of working, but I was pessimistic \u2013 this is Georgia, people don\u2019t participate. As a community builder it was difficult to reach out to people I didn\u2019t know, who didn\u2019t use social media that much. After the 1<sup>st</sup> workshop I was so impressed about the people and stories they shared \u2013 it was really about what they wanted to talk about\u201d\n\n? re: What UNDP could take on from this - \u201cdefinitely more flexible and less result space management approach to funding eg incubator system. I would like to see a panel of people selecting the projects, not just UNDP and their agenda.\u201d\n\nOnline is good, but definitely more additional value taken from physical meetups.\n\n@Hazem re: the people UNDP wants to reach out to - the place where they engage is not the one people feel confortable with. People doing things on the ground are harder to reach, they don\u2019t have trust in orgs like UNDP, they work with more flexibility than the rigid ways of such organisatins, and don\u2019t see themselves as innovators.\n\n<a href=\"/u/labanita\">@Ulrike von Ruecker</a>: engagement with citizens that do things often stops at institutionalization, these people are not institutionalized enough to be eligible for support. At the moment the scene is kind of blocking itself. Cities like Cairo is not where the majority is \u2013 we need to go there, to the other parts of Egypt. It\u2019s a question of trust and how people are invited to engage. Hanging on to the results all the time breaks the process, it can make you lose people.\n\nAlso available in audio:\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.spreaker.com/embed/player/standard?autoplay=false&amp;episode_id=4660492\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 131px; min-width: 400px;\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.spreaker.com/embed/player/standard?autoplay=false&amp;episode_id=4660590\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 131px; min-width: 400px;\"></iframe>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-04 07:27:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.039518", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1197, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3716, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3683, "post_number": 1, "raw": "It's fun to play with the Makerfox and see it grow up a bit, as we use it for the LOTE4 tickets \u2026 and yet, the Makerfox wasn't invented to be just cute like this, but to solve a real-world problem.

As someone who\u00a0participated in about half a dozen (failed) decentralization attempts, perhaps my experience warrants a more critical reflection or can serve as a word of warning. So, here goes.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Why do you wish to decentralize? No, seriously. I know it's somewhat of an organisational fashion, but unless you really know <em>why</em> you are doing it, how could you do it properly? The business with the \"finance guy\" suggests that it's more about wanting to offload responsibilities to other people, when you don't like them, than to seriously tap the potential of a group. The do-ocracy and ad-hocracy smells the same to me and it is something that I saw again and again: wanting other people to handle \"boring\" stuff, but deeply controlling\u00a0what really matters personally. Untill it goes wrong.\u00a0I'd also suggest to at least use a first name instead of \"finance guy\", this is needlessly dehumanizing.</li>\n\n<li>What is the exact problem with \"hierarchy\"? Sure, associating it with a fictional\u00a0bad guy is funny and all, but it is not exactly an argument. Hierarchy can indeed imply authority (delegated or involuntary), but it can also imply leadership, responsibility, etc. An organisation is not only about \"who does what\", but also about \"who decides what\", \"who takes responsibility for what\", \"who is responsible for assigning such responsibility and/or decision making rights\", etc etc. My own experience tells me that organisations that try to avoid <em>explicit</em> <em>leadership</em> and try to distribute <em>responsability</em> typically fail as they grind to a halt as soon as there is any kind of truly profound difference of opinion. Again, your story about essentially ex-communicating a key player in Edgeryders, shows clearly who the true \"bosses\" are. I highly doubt that this decision was taken in full consensus with the community, so it's a perfect example of \"do what I say, but not what I do\". The resolution to this essential dissonance is - in my experience - quite simple: just own up to the leadership and assume responsibility. After that, it's possible to give people more or less room to maneouver, but at least it is honest about what kind of situation they commit to.</li>\n\n<li>What is the price you think you will pay by having a (soft, non-dictatorial) hierarchy? (Which I think you implicitly have by the way.) I know there are numerous pitfalls in hierarchical organisations (which is the overwhelmingly majority of all organisations), but have you considered mitigating those without trying to reinvent the way humans have organised groups for ages? Are there pitfalls (a \"price\") that you believe you would be unable to avoid? Are there examples of organisations that <em>are</em> hierarchical to a degree and yet you still admire?</li>\n\n<li>Do you feel that people are still confused about how Edgeryders works? Why would that be? Is it possible that this has to do with the fact that the presentation doesn't match the execution? I know it is easy to blame the outside world for \"not understanding the way you work\", but you typically attract <em>very</em> smart people, so what gives?</li>\n\n<li>What are you trying to achieve with your transparency efforts? Is this the only\u00a0pre-requisite for decentralization? Does it have <em>inherent</em> benefits that would work in other styles of organisations? Again, I think it is important to realise why you are doing it. If it is only to enforce decentralisation, then the message you are sending in your organisation is that information and communication is indeed still the best form of power in Edgeryders. (I've actually witnessed some backchanneling that directly supports this thesis, so quite a worrying element.) Transparency can be a way to \"de-power\" people, but only if information becomes trivial to come by. As long as there are ways to hide information, people can and will - to my personal horrifying experience - abuse this gap all the way to the top. So, how to obtain and maintain\u00a0a true <em>culture</em> of transparency? I don't think API's can do that.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2016-04-27 10:41:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.932321", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 728, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9749, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2902, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Resonances</b>\n\nWelcome, Ben! <span>There are interesting resonances between Edgeryders and network science, what with <a href=\"/u/la_gaia\">@La_Gaia</a>, <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>\u00a0and others (<a href=\"/user/5634\">@ericnbarrett</a>, maybe?) all being passionate about networks.

Why</h4>Because people who live off-the-matrix, voluntarily or forced, need theknowledge and practical skills both for survival and for getting organised.\n\n<h4>2. What</h4>We gather, verify, improve and disseminate practical skills for social self-organisation. From making rocket stoves, rainwater harvest systems, through urban farming &amp; food processing, to radical cooperatives' organisation, consensual decision making and social problem solving technologies. We run demo installations (rocket stove heating in a squat in Warsaw), workshops (consensus-driven decision making) and make tutorials. The first and major point is that we are not focused on leaders. We are focused on communities.\n\nThen we are not focused on \"making a difference\". We are focused on teaching people how to increase their independence in key areas:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>food</li>\n\n<li>energy</li>\n\n<li>technology</li>\n\n<li>social structure &amp; procedures.</li>\n\n</ul>Finally, we are not focused on people who are in a search for a project/mission. We are focused on those who have the goal - even just a personal one. We provide\n\ntools, not ideas.\n\nFormally speaking, the FreeLab mission is to gather, verify, refine and spread all practical skills needed for social self-organisation.\n\n<h4>3. How</h4>We set up a team of people, living&amp;working together as a collective. We settled in a rural area of Poland. The facility includes a house, a barn (being adapted as a\n\nworkshop area) and 1ha of garden. Our approach is to make off-the-system communities sustainable and resilient in respect of food, energy and technology. The first stage is the 'scarp source ecology' \u2013 using waste and recycled materials. Then we move towards locally produced/grown materials and producst, shortening recycling loops and energy circulation. Local food, local energy, local production \u2013 the goal is to have up to 80% of needs fullfilled from local sources.\n\n<h4>4. Who</h4>There are 4 people, all homelless and jobless, being full time collective members, two honorary members and several \u201eFriends of FreeLab\u201d, working remotely. We\n\nalso have couple dozens of supporters, mainly over the Net. This winter we hope to invite two more full-timers, after a trial period. Currently, the members are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Beata, 24 yo, artist, maker, dancer and musician. She's an avid food maker and great tutor.</li>\n\n<li>Michal, 25 yo, musician, gardener, descendant of a long tradition of blacksmith family.</li>\n\n<li>Natalia, 55 yo, activist, translator (GER&amp;RUS), natural therapist, counsellor, cook, gardener and biker.</li>\n\n<li>Petros, 48 yo, technologist, tinkerer, speaker, coach. Co-founder of <a href=\"http://hackerspace.pl\">Warsaw Hackerspace</a> and independent political writer.</li>\n\n</ul>We are homeless, jobless and (mostly) bankrupt. We are pathfinders for people like us - leaving the mainstream or being excluded by the system.\n\nWe are not interested in spreading our personal stories. We are interested in serving intentional coummunities and individuals around us. The rocket stove, rainfall harvest system or consensus-driven decision-making procedures will work all the same disregarding personal stories of \"people behind the project\". Less 'ego', more 'go'.\n\n<h4>5. Story so far</h4>Started last spring, FreeLab begun its operations in the middle of nowhere, near Opole, in SW Poland. During summer months we developed basic infrastructure\n\n(rainfall harvest, solar power station, rocket stove kitchen), run several workshops on-site and throughout Poland (Animal Rights Gathering Poland, Wodstock Stop\n\nFestival, Antinuclear Camp Lubiatowo, squatting communities in Poznan and Warsaw, Anarchist Federation summer camp). For the winter time we were invited\n\nto Poznan, to establish an urban Freelab facility. During the move the proposed location (a squatted building) has been evicted by armed police forces. Thanks to\n\nour friends, related to the Rainbow Family, we got an invitation to settle in Grab\u00f3wka in SE Poland.\n\nCurrently we are operating as a sort of secular mendicant order, raising funds from our supporters, working locally for a share of crops and running extra-curriculum classes in local schools in exchange for food and wood for winter.\n\nOnce we gather provisions (6 ppl * 6 months) and have the house and barn prepared for winter, we shall be able to resume normal FreeLab operations. We already have an invitation from Warsaw squatting community to run rocket stove workshops. We also prepare couple \u201eIT for activists\u201d projects, plus a number of publications to be presented online and during public events.\n\nBeginning next spring, we shall start new series of prototyping and workshops, covering local food and energy production. We shall also test our solutions during the refurbishment of the house, barn and garden.\n\n<h4>6. Our needs</h4>Food, wood and basic resources we shall arrange locally \u2013 by working and begging. Our extra needs include fixing broken equipment (2 Kindle readers &amp; Dell XPS \u2013 broken screens, fiat ducato \u2013 major engine failure), and some hi-tech gear: camera for tutorial movies, Itronix rugged tablets &amp; laptops for field ops (pre-owned, preferably; can be just a case, battery, mainboard and screen \u2013 we shall gradually make them complete), PV panels and controllers \u2013 older generation will do, we have a LOT of roof.\n\nMinor items: LED lights (12V &amp; 230V); accus of all kinds: AAA, AA, C, D, 9v; Battery driven tools (12V preferably); hand winch, electric winch.\n\nWe also need people to help us with electronics for our constructions, microcontroller programming and power adaptors construction. The main project in this area is an intelligent battery bank. See \u201eWinter projects\u201d below.\n\nBeginning spring we shall be inviting guests to help us with house/barn refurbishment and garden recultivation. Through the winter we plan to work for construction materials and to gather enough wood and other components to make the job doable.\n\n<h4>7.

Raul is a activist for disability rights and founder of the nonprofit organisation \u201eSozialhelden\u201c.\n\nRaul has glass bones and sits in a wheelchair. I asked him several questions and a couple of them i will list in this essay:\n\nRaul believes that people with disabilities are in a way sorted out of the everyday life. They are in special-needs schools, sheltered workshops, care homes etc. This results in prejudice and fear.\u00a0\n\n\u201eEvery tenth person in our society has a disability, but not every tenth person in our circle of friends is disabled. That means: They have to be somewhere! We are hidden. In \u201especialized institutions\u201c. We are engaged in sheltered workshops, brought into care homes, because we are too expensive if we want to live alone\u2026\u201c\n\nIn our conversation, he emphasized, that people with disabilities are always associated with a cost-factor. But not only that. There is always a \u201especial\u201c solution for people with disabilities. He gave me the advice, since I study product design, to always try to include people with disability into my designs. Not to try to find a special solution for people with disabilities but to mainstream it. This would be a big step towards inclusion.\n\nWe also talked about the \u201e Behindertengleichstellungsgesetzt\u201c. (Disabled-equality-law)\n\nThis law aims to eliminate or prevent discrimination against persons with disabilities and ensures equal participation of people with disabilities in the life in society and enables them to independent living.\n\nIn Germany however, only the state is obliged to guarantee accessibility, e.g. in public offices, buildings, etc.\n\nBut if we compare how often we go to a state office and how often we go to a caf\u00e9, restaurant, cinema or supermarket, it is very unbalanced. Inclusion and participation can therefore only work, if the private sector must be involved. Furthermore private companies provide jobs, that may be also filled up with people with disabilities. It is unrealistic to believe, that the \u201edisabled-equality-law\u201c is sufficient enough, if it only takes the state in the duty.\n\nSo to make a step towards an inclusive society, it must come to encounters between people with and without disabilities. But for creating encounters, we have to remove barriers. So the cause is the barrier and the result is the non existing encounter. For successful inclusion, in which it is no longer necessary to use term \u201einclusion\u201c, we need accessibility.\n\nI also asked Raul what he wishes for the social intercourse between people with and without disabilites. This was his answer:\n\n\u201eMore normality. More everyday life. Not that someone needs to change his behavior, that happens naturally. I don't want to teach a seminar with the topic how to interact with people with disabilities. Everyone will teach it themselves if we meet each other. This would mean, that we need to remove barriers. We have to open schools and universities for people with disabilities. If we would meet each other, we would learn from each other. I personally only learned how to interact with disability by interacting with disability. Its learning by doing. There is no school for that.\u201c\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-31 22:30:13", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:30:32.941116", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28085, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2619, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>bad internet connection </b>\n\nsorry I have problems with my connection it took longer than expected to be fixed ......hopefully it will be fixed on monday\n\nfor the post I would break it down into the 3 different groups\n\nanother question , what about translating the content into arabic in the website , is someone working on them or not ?\n\n-----------\n\n\u00a0\n\nfor the home schooling Hany's words when I asked him about isolating the kids was that he thinks that social life of school is overrated as most of the time they are in class and even in the lunch break because of the big no of students it's not that good , some kids stay all the break time waiting to get to buy food , anyways he says actually interacting with people outside school is better and the kids have their friends from the sports training they do and from their neighbourhod .\n\nfor the organization of the learning process it varies from one group to another ,in this particular case one person is responsible for most of it , but in others as he told me some mothers are organizing the process.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-03 12:11:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.837794", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 207, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26264, "user_id": 452, "topic_id": 1519, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Your thinking though very interesting and compelling is far out of my league to competently comment or challenge. \u00a0I'm firmly with you though on the need for hard resilience, because it is a hedge that costs little and has the potential to save much. \u00a0\n\nI do have a hard to verify meta view that in my mind creates a nice outline for the situation going on in industrial worlds. \u00a0It's simplistic and common, but in my mind relevant. \u00a0Essentially western industrial societies have reached a stagnation point where they can not grow at the rate demanded by our financial insitutions. At the core this failure is caused by a combination of energy and resource extraction costs and rate limitations. Since we in the west shudder to think about reinventing our lifestyles in the context of reducing our resource consumption our future seems to rest on an absolutely wild hail mary pass for cheap abundant to be determined energy source or alternatively duking it out with the rest of the world in no holds bar vulture capitalism to guarantee the resources we need. \u00a0Obviously we have not yet succeeeded \u00a0on the energy hail mary pass, and so perhaps we are in the process of necessarily \"culling the herd\"of industrial countries so to speak with the weakest financial countries like Spain and Greece first to go. \u00a0If there is any sense whatsoever to that view then it would seem our only real deep option is to reinvent our lifestyles and unplug from the industrial machine. \u00a0\n\nMy speculations aside, it sounds like you've made a compelling case that Europe is at war when you accept the definition war is when one state attempts to steal the property of another. \u00a0I follow the folks at automatic earth and they argue the credit bubble is about to pop and that one of the big consequences is that multiple entities will have claim to a single asset or bit of wealth. Seems like that is essentially what you are describing. \u00a0The only real counter that I can see to your argument that europe is at war is if one believes that the financial rules and lending practices that led to the mess were fair. \u00a0In that case nobody is stealing anything and you are simply seeing the rules of the capitalist system that the governments agreed to being played out harshly, but fairly. \u00a0I certainly don't buy that view, but there might be some.....\n\nIn any case being a relative youngster I'm personally going way long and deep on resilient skills and learning to think in a post industrial mindset. \u00a0Probably a few years ahead of my time so hopefully by the time I actually need them I'll be ready and able....\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-21 15:51:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.597483", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 499, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1375, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1342, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">MEET THE EDGERYDERS AMBASSADORS</h2>Last week in Strasbourg, the Edgeryders team met with representatives of the Council of Europe.

Changed paradigm of youth values in the times of crisis</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Reducing youth unemployment is critical to ensure young people achieve their professional aspirations, to prevent deterioration of skills acquired through education, to prevent dependence on their families with respect to housing and money</li>\n\n<li>Part time work and temporary contracts are very popular among youth because they\u2019re easier to access than permanent work, but are not sustainable in the long run and the risk is they will perpetuate a cycle of insecurity and precariousness</li>\n\n<li>Countries in Mediterranean and Eastern Europe (the latter being less represented in the Edgeryders sample) display higher youth unemployment rates (&gt;30%) and need more elaborated policy solutions</li>\n\n</ul><u>Edgeryders profile</u>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>they speak to a threefold audience: peers, researchers and policy makers</li>\n\n<li>are in a much better situation than an average young person in danger of social exclusion and adverse economic situation, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNEET&amp;ei=rr4oUKqAEILWtAabuYC4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNECZCHBs4fpzD_BGZuDtXkCXmTjKA\">NEETs</a> or low educated\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>a majority live in <em>multiple cities</em> across Europe</li>\n\n<li>make a case for increased mobility: a 2011 Eurobarometer revealed that 77% of youth have not experienced living in another country, and the implication is they lose an opportunity to gain skills and exposure to ideas, people and goods.</li>\n\n</ul><strong>2. Horizon of the skills: Learned vs Reality</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>educational systems are perceived as outdated, theory-focused, and failing to equip young graduates with the skills needed for in the labour market</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders place a lot of value in peer to peer learning and opportunity learning, online and through ICT technologies - this may be of value to the extent that labor markets are able to absorb this less specialized and more interdisciplinary oriented individuals</li>\n\n</ul><strong>3. Making a living: Clash of generations</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>young people today are adopting an employment model that\u2019s fundamentally different from their parents\u2019; but non-linear, portfolio careers may result in precarious jobs, difficulties in changing jobs due to high unemployment, sectorial and geographical (im)mobility, hierarchies that make it difficult to advance in one\u2019s career.</li>\n\n<li>meaningful work is a priority for Edgeryders, and it often trumps paid work; in the case of\u00a0 unpaid internships, they are inadequate because interns seem to be extensions or replacements for regular staff (European Youth Forum 2011)</li>\n\n<li>recruitment processes are most often deemed to be ill-suited in matching skills with needs, often idiosyncratic, and those in the community having experience with applications aren\u2019t seeing any value in the process.</li>\n\n</ul><u>When institutional \u201csafety nets\u201d are failing</u>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>family</strong> is one traditional structure that\u2019s perceived by Edgeryders to be an ally, in line with studies showing that young people nowadays leave parental homes later than before; a 2007 Eurobarometer cited 44% of young adults saying it\u2019s because they couldn\u2019t afford to move out, while 28% believed there wasn\u2019t enough affordable housing</li>\n\n<li><strong>peer networks</strong> are valuable for mutual understanding and learning, moral and even financial support</li>\n\n<li><strong>government</strong> is not perceived as supportive when it comes to funding innovation or offering incentives to pursue funding: the backdrop here is that encouraging entrepreneurship has been a target of the European Commission, for its potential to foster economic growth; In the \u201cYouth on the move\u201d Eurobarometer, 43% of young respondents stated they would like to set up their own business, but there is a widespread perception of financial and administrative barriers, and risks associated with them.</li>\n\n<li>the Eurobarometer data present \u201can average\u201d European, but in the Edgeryders community there\u2019s much more interest (a \u201cnerve\u201d for innovation), and entrepreneurship is a way to find meaning in one\u2019s work</li>\n\n</ul><strong>4. Policy 2.0: objects becoming creators of new framework for decision making</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Policy 2.0 (coined by Emiliano Fatello): requires a bridging of local, regional, national and international scale issues through the digital tools Edgeryders are already adept at employing.</li>\n\n<li>an additional aim of Council of Europe\u2019s project: to restore trust of young European citizens in their institutions</li>\n\n<li>the Edgeryders model: citizens are no longer objects of policy, rather they are citizen experts actively engaged in policy-making</li>\n\n<li>lessons for policy-makers: looking at Edgeryders approaches they should take next steps towards real \u201cevidence based policy\u201d</li>\n\n</ul>\u00a0\n\n<strong>Edgeryders related posts on MAKING A

We will be traveling to Matera not just as visitors, in the annual Edgeryders community event, but as active supporters of a community born project. Our biggest yet! The unMonastery needs all the help it can get as it prepares to launch next February: from designing the interiors, to designing the clothing for the unMonasterians and working out protocols of engagement with the local community in Matera. We\u2019re dedicating a whole program track at this, and now\u2019s the time to put everything together.\n\n<strong>This Friday</strong> we want to meet, discuss and plan ahead. The aim is to create a working group of Lote3 volunteers focusing on unMonastery related tasks, similarly to how we did it with <a href=\"/lote-social-media-team\">social media</a> and <a href=\"/t/lote3/312-logistics-team/accommodation\">accommodation</a> teams \u2013 by decentralizing and packetizing diverse tasks.

I see Pop Culture as a language which has given people all over the world possibilities to understand common references, re-create identity and make own choices about who they want to be perceived as, non-dependent on given entities such as ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality and class. Add Internet to this and there are never seen before possibilities of co-operating, sharing knowledge to re-writing maps, change structures.\n\n<b>To be a 2FACE</b><b>D1</b> is a state of mind, the actual expression comes from finding a common denominator among the people I always hung out with. We had a common way of letting our identity depend on our environment, all of us were highly aware about existing stereotypes related to our ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality and class. I realized we were trying to avoid them and sometimes play with them to make people think twice about who we were. So to be two-faced doesn\u2019t mean anything negative here, it rather explain the double folded view you have on identity if you\u2019re not the existing norm in the society. With this double perspective comes understanding also for other peoples situation. To the feet in different worlds, means being able to move between them but also feel rather at home in that space in between. You dare to step out of your comfort zone and become one of the new identities where ol' categories are mashed up and where rootlessness and non-given identity just means major possibilities.\n\n<b>The network of 2FACED1</b>s includes progressive stereotypophobes with this double perspective on identity. <a href=\"http://www.2faced1.com\"><b>2FACED1.com</b></a> is a display-window for this mindset, via two photos it shows one persons two different faces;\n\n\u00a0\n\nPersona 1:\n\nWHAT YOU WANT TO BE\n\nCONSIDERED AS\n\n\u00a0\n\nPersona 2:\n\nWHAT YOU FEAR TO BE\n\nCONSIDERED AS\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis leads to a discussion about stereotypes and inner fears of getting misunderstood by the surroundings. Thoughts that every thinking modern day person does reflect upon. We're asking every day people from an innercity context where old categories as ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality and class are reassessed, why they choose to look like they do. We\u2019re diggin' deep, peeling off garments, codes and attributes. We\u2019re searching for transnational identities - is the conclusion that we choose whoever we want to be today?!\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4c9f4a106fd69364b5aed41bbfeefa679bf5730.jpg\" width=\"569\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nHopefully these 2FACED1's <a href=\"http://2faced1.com/\">interviews </a>inspire the reader to alternate ways of live instead of recreating stereotypes which maintain present injustice structures.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/37058821 <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/37058821\">2FACED1 \\#5: A Golden Middle Finger</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/hi2faced1\">2FACED1</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-03 15:47:50", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 06:29:36.074244", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 588, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 40.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30907, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1132, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Don't worry!</b>\n\nWe all do our best, Pedro. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-15 08:58:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.082413", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30657], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23065, "user_id": 51, "topic_id": 1782, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>another link - bitbeam</b>\n\nseems sensible to keep them going ::\u00a0http://bitbeam.org/about/\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-08 21:12:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.032100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22100], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17685, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4923, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Redirected</b>\n\nThe Schimba Romania site seems to have been redirected to http://46.101.175.67/", "created_at": "2015-11-08 17:42:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.661443", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15558], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16103, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5619, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>EMDesk session scheduled</b>\n\nHello,\u00a0\n\nThe session is\u00a0now scheduled on the EMDesk calendar - every partner should have received a notification :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-17 07:50:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.312585", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20202, "user_id": 1438, "topic_id": 1921, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>unknown lady</b>\n\nI can reach her!

What's going to happen?</h2>\n\nAs part of the <a href=\"/t/storytelling-workshop-narratives-of-care-2016/5146\">Storytelling Workshop: Narratives of care 2016</a>, <a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\">@Thomas Goorden</a> will be leading an experiential and intensive workshop loosely based on Joe Edelman's \"<a href=\"https://quip.com/kc4jAKO83gUD\">Hyperactive Listening</a>\" format.\n\nYou can participate as either \"<strong>Story</strong>\" or as \"<strong>Storyteller</strong>\":\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Story</h3>\n\nYour \"story\" will become the center of an investigative group exercise. The messier your \"story\", the better the workshop will be. Perhaps you are working on a project, but aren't really sure what it is or have difficulty explaining it to people? Perhaps you are stuck in some kind of dilemma or conflict that you find difficult to get past? Perfect! We will take a significant amount of time to figure out what is going on and help you get on your way (again).\n\nThe outcome of the workshop (for you) will be text, diagrams, video and pictures that you can use to explain your story when those questions come up once more.\n\nWhat kind of story? any story, but reflect on how it ties to\u00a0health/social care+ technology +communities\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Storyteller</h3>\n\nA good storyteller is in the first place someone who can <em>listen</em> to someone's story (even if it is your own). You'll then get to ask questions, investigate, analyze, try to distil the essence of a story, receive feedback and start from the beginning again. Until we get it \"right\".\n\nYou'll learn and practice all sorts of skills valuable for telling your own stories when they need it. And of course you will discover all sorts of projects other people are working on. But mostly, you will have the deep satisfaction of having been able to help someone.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">B. Participants Registration</h2>\n\nPlease follow the instructions on the event page:\u00a0<a href=\"/t/storytelling-workshop-narratives-of-care-2016/5146\">Storytelling Workshop</a>.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">C. What else?</h2>\n\nWe will practice some experimental identity/co-counseling methods in between story sessions. The goal here is to see if you can discover new, profound truths about your own story.\n\nYou will also be invited to provide feedback on the workshops methods themselves. Since they are quite new and/or relatively unknown, we welcome improvements and commentary.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Your output from the workshop: a professional kit\u00a0</h3>\n\nAt the end of the day, we will have fleshed out together a\u00a0number of strong narratives on care.\u00a0In this case, this means engaging\u00a0stories that participants can showcase later on to build support for their project. The person behind the \"story\" will gain:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a hi-resolution photograph\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>text and diagrams illustrating the story</li>\n\n<li>a short video recording\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFor the video, we will add a \"scribe\" and a \"confessional\" (video) booth. Only one participant can really be the focus during a certain period (I'd say min 30 minutes), so it restricts how many projects could be \"processed\". However, that also means people can participate without being the \"focus\", \u00a0by being simply storytellers.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Licensing</h3>\n\nAll material produced, including notes from the session.. will be published under a creative commons license on\u00a0<a href=\"/\">edgeryders.eu</a>\u00a0\u00a0(we'll need a signed release form from each participant at beginning of workshop)\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What should you bring along?</h3>\n\nIdeally, a laptop per story, so we can start writing them down straight away and maybe publish by the end of the day some of them.

(For how to implement them, see the <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer-software-design/3905\">software design</a>.) This is a wiki, and so far just an agreement about the foundational, basic features. You're welcome to contribute!\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Code management features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><b>Code manager. </b>Means, creating codes with a graphical interface. (Contained in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZuwwVlMCjdcZVmdWi4tn24PQhFYTBon9q_3JIGZZK0\">the proposal</a>, p. 9, as \"Build a code manager\".)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Information in a code.</strong> The following information will go into a code:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>code name</li>\n\n<li>code definition (free text)</li>\n\n<li>code author (user ID reference)</li>\n\n<li>creation date</li>\n\n<li>sharing status (public or private)</li>\n\n<li>code tags [<span>optional / later</span>] (every user will be able to tag a code with his own codes only, so in principle a single multi-value term reference field is sufficient to store all the code tags)</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Code networks.</strong> [<span>undecided</span>] Coding would happen with \"just codes\". But codes could be applied not just to text, but also to other codes as \"code tags\". This will lead to code networks that can be exported to, for example, RQDA's code groups. Thus, they would only be relevant for analysis, not for coding itself, because coding with the auto-complete function allows a fast workstyle already. Codes networks will also not be used to aggregate codes into \"higher-level\" codes that are composed from constituent codes from different authors; for such collaboration / code re-use, it is better to use a \"fork and pull request\" approach [<a href=\"/t/this-is-what-open-ethnographer-will-be-like/3921/9\">reasoning</a>]\n\n\u00a0 A reason not to implement it at all could be that, since code networks / code structures are only for analysis, they should be built within the CAQDAS software to which Open Ethnographer exports. Since re-exporting would usually mean that this work has to be repeated in the CAQDAS software, it will however probably be better to support code structures inside Open Ethnographer and export them. This feature is not completely decided yet, though. See the <a href=\"/t/this-is-what-open-ethnographer-will-be-like/3921/6\">this discussion</a>, esp. the <a href=\"/t/this-is-what-open-ethnographer-will-be-like/3921/10\">latest input</a>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Coding features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Coding while reading.</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Removing codings while reading.</strong> This is relevant esp. because it is needed often after forking a code from another researcher.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Coding by every authenticated user.</strong> In the spirit of openness, it is not necessary to exclude anybody from coding. Those users who are not trained ethnographers might not create high-quality codings, but it does not matter as ethnographers do not have to use or reuse their codings.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Code selection options.</strong> The following two modes to quickly select a code to apply to a selection of text are desirable:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Instant search.</strong> If the researcher already knows the code name, filtering a flat code list client-side while typing is fastest.</li>\n\n<li><strong><span>Hierarchical selection</span>.</strong> Using a tree-like structure. This is not completely decided, but it seems from initial tests that instant search is way enough. See <a href=\"/t/this-is-what-open-ethnographer-will-be-like/3921/6\">this discussion</a>.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><b>Parallel coding.</b> Multiple ethnographers (potentially every Drupal user) should be able to develop their own codings. (Referred in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZuwwVlMCjdcZVmdWi4tn24PQhFYTBon9q_3JIGZZK0\">the proposal</a>, p. 10, as \"Build a solution for different users to code the same online content in parallel.\")</li>\n\n<li><strong>Coding progress memory.</strong> There should be a feature allowing to say that a certain text has been coded with a certain code (and if with the base version or also re-coded with the own, forked version of a code). Even if none of the codes appears in the text. Because that allows other researchers who build on existing work to know the extent of the existing coding work.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Support for re-coding / code refining.</strong> It may happen often (does it?) that a researcher wants to look for a code and refine its use by re-coding with two different codes. If so, a basic quotation manager (\"search by code\" function) has to be right in the coding software.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Voluntary publishing of codings.</strong> Alberto, Inga and Noemi did a <a href=\"/t/would-ethnographers-do-open-notebook-science/3885\">small survey</a> to see if ethnographers are ok with an obligatory \"open notebook science\" approach. It turns out, they are not against sharing, but uncomfortable with obligatory sharing of codings. So the sharing should be voluntary. This affects the basic way of how codings can be stored (as markup in the live version for all-public codings, vs. stand-off annotation for private and sharable codings).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration via fork and merge.</strong> [<span>prepare, and implement forking; merging back can wait</span>] Open online ethnography is mostly disruptive due to its collaborative potential, allowing to collaboratively code much larger corpi of text in aggregative manner. This also requires a collaboration feature that allows different researchers to have different opinions about how to code what, so allowing to add to and remove from the codings with one code that another researcher did. Fork and merge allows for this.\n\n\u00a0 Merging can be implemented later, as it \"only\" makes looking at others' changes and recoding them with own codes more comfortable. When implementing it, here is how: at every moment, a researcher will be able to compare the coding status of one of their codes with all the forked versions that are around. The software will indicate differences (both added and removed codings to words) with each forked version, excluding only changes that one manually rejected earlier. These differences can then be reviewed and taken over selectively. For the double use of rendering codings as linked data (RDFa markup) into the public website output, Drupal could then use the union set of all publicly shared tags in a \"fork set\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>Revisions for codings and coded texts.</strong> [<span>prepare; implementing can wait</span>] While taking over all codings into the new live version when an edit is done is a good idea, in addition codings should be tied to a revision of the coded text. This is relevant because Open Ethnographer should allow to reproduce the findings of researchers, and for that a defined data version has to exist. This means that the coding progress information has to be stored not per code and text, but as multiple data points per code and revision of text. And when exporting codings, a date-based version has to be chosen, defaulting to the most current one for each code.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Coding the live version.</strong> [<span>optional</span>] This would allow showing the codings even after the coded text got edited after the coding. Without this, codings can only be shown in the version that was coded. This makes sharing the codings difficult, since another researcher could work on a newer version. It also makes reusing the codings for semantic web purposes difficult, since web visitors are always shown the most current version. However, the effect of these difficulties is low since it barely happens that somebody changes their post (and if so, mostly directly after posting, before the coding happened.)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Publication and sharing features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><b>Export to QDA software.</b>\u00a0Ideally, the codings of one ethnographer could be saved into a file (also including codings from others that this ethnographer did take over into her code hierarchy). The requirement is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Ability to filter which content will be in the export.</strong> Making a list of groups is granular enough. Non-relevant content (like administrative posts etc.) in these groups can be easily ignored as it will not be coded either, and can also be deleted in the export's target QDA software if needed.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Ability to filter which codes will be in the export.</strong> This would default to \"all own codes, including shared codes to which one has subscribed\", but options would allow to limit this further. Since it is rarely needed that one wants to exclude <em>own</em> tags, implementing this part can wait or even be discarded.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Export for download in a format of one open source QDA software.</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Real-time syncing to a web-based open source QDA software.</strong> [<span>optional</span>] This can be the same QDA software as the one for which a downloadable file is offered.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Semantic web integration.</strong> [<span>prepare; implementing can wait</span>] Export to Internet search engines via RDFa, ideally using RDF ontologies that they understand. This is optional, but the software architecture must be designed to allow it.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Obligatory sharing with authors.</strong> [<span>undecided</span>] Maybe, for transparency it is a good idea to enforce that authors can see all codings in their own texts, even if they are marked as \"private\" by the ethnographers creating them.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Analysis features</h2>\n\nDecision: There is little meaning in recreating the full analysis part of QDA tools, so we should not do this. There are tools for this already, just not for collaborative coding of live data. We will instead interface with existing tools by exporting and syncing.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Quotation manager.</strong> Basically, this is an integrated site-wide search function to search by code. However, this is not strictly required since an ethnographer can use the external analysis tool for this. But it would be nice to have, since it makes coding and re-coding text simpler if a quotation manager is provided that allows to quickly switch from search results to coding. (Referred to in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZuwwVlMCjdcZVmdWi4tn24PQhFYTBon9q_3JIGZZK0\">the proposal</a>, p. 9, as \"Build a quotation manager.\")</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tree of keywords.</strong> [<span>prepare; implementing can wait</span>] Ben used this kind of diagram in his network analysis report for \"Spot the Future\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>Advanced code search.</strong> [<span>prepare; implement later</span>] This refers the more sophisticated analysis features usually found in QDA software:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Search by revision date.</strong> This would allow using the integrated analysis tools to check and confirm conclusions of other ethnographers.</li>\n\n<li><b>Include / exclude codings from individual coders.</b></li>\n\n<li><b>Vicinity search for coding combinations.</b></li>\n\n<li><strong>Searching by multiple tags with boolean operators.</strong></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Federation via semantic web linked data.</strong> [<span>prepare; implement much later</span>] With this feature, coding can happen on multiple websites independently, with shared or connected code hierarchies. The coded data is then shared, for example via SPARQL endpoints that allow searching for codes across multiple websites.</li>\n\n<li><b>Semantic search and knowledge deduction.</b> [<span>optional, much later</span>] This would be a kind of semantic search inside ones own website, potentially opening a way to a much bigger participation from the Drupal open source community as the plugin would suddenly be about semantic search, not \"just\" ethnography.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Privacy features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><b>Consent management.</b> [<span>prepare, implementing can wait</span>] So, it must not be possible to code something where the user has not given consent. The problem with the prototype was that the \"consent on signup\" was not really working, as people do not read long agreements on signup. Maybe it should be a tickmark on the user profile, or when posting content. However, given that Annotator as a browser plugin can do stand-off annotation, it is questionable if missing consent can be enforced at all, and thus, if it makes sense to require consent \u2026</li>\n\n<li><b>Managing third party content.</b> [<span>prepare; implementing can wait</span>] Is third-party content (which is reported on the platform, not directly created) content that is relevant for ethnography at all? Alberto proposes that the content can go in, as \"transcriptions do qualify as qualitative data\". We lose the connection to an Edgeryders account in that way, though. It would not work to invite all these interviewed people on the platform, but would be ok if their content is included.

To quote you:\n\n<em>I look at the world and it saddens me that there is so much injustice, oppression, suffering, greed, stupidity and violence. I'd like to see humans doing a better job of things/society/politics. One of the projects I want to work on with others is improving this situation. So as above, I think the most efficient way for me to work on this problem is in a real-life community.</em>\n\n<em>Starting a community and getting our own space is also probably a good step towards fixing some of these problems. It gives us the control to experiment with new types of society/economy/politics. It gives us our own little world/space where we can try the things we want with minimal interference from pre-existing powers. If we can build something there that we think is an improvement, others will look at us and see that our ways are better, then they can try the same things.</em>\n\nI am always surprised to learn about similar initiatives who could benefit a lot from the model [Ben] and others here are prototyping. And how joining forces could help many more of us realise what we dream about. Look, I've just looked up\u00a0the first post ever introducing the unMonastery, back when it was only a group idea born out of the needs you've identified yourself, the difference being that they've been open to the idea of working with the establishment:\n\n<em>everyone felt that they knew of places around Europe with serious structural problems, which were often the same - things such as underused building stock combined with homelessness; a feeling of community breakdown and lack of rootedness; high levels of youth unemployment; low levels of computer literacy, meaning low take-up of low-cost technical solutions to social problems; lack of socially-conscious arts infrastructure. at the same time, we each felt that we had a set of skills that were under-used, or which we could put to use in a socially-conscious way.</em>\n\n<em>the solution:\u00a0decide on city that needs help with those sorts of problems. talk to local authorities and city leaders. persuade them to give us a space to use, as a co-operative live/work space, for at least a year. we move there as a small-ish group. we work, alongside local residents, to help the community adapt in a positive way, using the specialist skills that we would bring. </em>(<a href=\"/t/a-few-of-us-living-together-somewhere-and-changing-things-the-un-monastery/1672\">read more</a><span>)</span>\n\n<span>Maybe you'd like to consider applying for the unMonastery? Or visit ? Another thing is that the unMonastery is open to being borrowed, replicated, re-mixed\u00a0by whomever wishes to do so.

I am actually preparing a proposal with Marrakech, Morocco as the destination for LOTE5 and this was really helpful for me to grasp the main points to be made.\n\nAlthough for the moment I am the only Edgeryders member from Morocco, I do hope to have more people to support my idea of having LOTE5 in Marrakech with the time.\n\nJust an overview of my thinking about Marrakech for LOTE5:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u00a0Background: Morocco is a melting pot of cultures and civilizations and only 10 kms away from mainland Europe. I've travelled in Middle East and MENA and I can say for sure there is no place like Morocco - it's vibrant and multicultural, traditional and progressive, lots of innovative projects and community based initiatives take place and the life here has a different rhythm that you need to experience to understand :-)</li>\n\n<li>Accessability: Morocco is only 3 hours flight away from Europe and there are cheap carriers from most of the European airports to Marrakech</li>\n\n<li>Morocco is in the spotlight @Edgeryders: this will be the perfect chance to get to know the stories of Moroccan activists trying to change the things for the better in a society with less than 50% literacy level and a useless government. You may not believe, but activists here are going through similar but tougher battles here than in Europe. We might be able to teach and share a lot!\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>I am a travel advisor for Morocco(meaning i know the country well - it's used to be my full time job for years but i'm quitting now) and I've learnt the country specifics and its needs. I have lots of contacts with people who are making actual changes in the society - I am sure they will be happy to participate and volunteer for LOTE5, some by providing funds(space, accommodation, food, etc) and others by helping spread the word,etc. I feel I may be able to coordinate this event but I would definitely need help(which I am sure if available from recent various posts by members)</li>\n\n<li>Last but no least, LOTE5 to me is supposed to help us to restructure and move to a new level of organisation. An insight of the Moroccan reality could be a wake up call for @Edgeryders!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n@emkay I also agree that\u00a0<span>\"Them that does the chopping, eats the dinner.\" and \"them that builds the infrastructure calls the shots.\" </span><span>\u00a0is not quite the way to go. We need to be open to share and learn!</span>\n\n<span>I will create a separate post later and will be looking forward to feedback from you all :-)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 23:26:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.032039", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 549, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23625, "user_id": 3279, "topic_id": 647, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Connection between creativity and mental illness</b>\n\nHi @Noemi @Pauline, is this challenge ongoing?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-26 15:28:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.105108", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1296, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1263, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have less experience in this area of balancing work and other resources to make a living, as I have just graduated from university (post grad \u2013 see my background <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/my-story-standing-still-crossroads-and-hoping-transition-happen-without\">here</a>). What I can do is answer the question in the brief:\u00a0<strong>What do you look for when you look for work? Money, obviously. Security? The opportunity to contribute to society, to build something useful? A feeling of belonging?</strong>\n\nI have never looked at my professional future as being dependent on monetary issues or had any relationship with money whatsoever, as opposed to Vinay\u2019s <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/going-beyond-work-separating-meaning-and-money-and-surviving-meanwhile\">fabulous story</a><strong>.</strong> I never thought of salary as a reward for my work because I just had other priority indicators to measure my satisfaction with own work-\u00a0 not revenues, but quality. For me, an indicator of success in making a living so far has been knowledge and personal growth in no matter what I would do. What\u2019s very important is to be able to do my work well, really well, and gain some recognition \u2013 even verbal recognition from someone would suffice at this point, because I am under the impression that intellectual work is really hard to get paid at this age and lack of skills. maybe I'm wrong, or maybe\u00a0I haven't lived enough or in misery to really talk about the value of work, having work, and money.\n\n<strong>Being 24 and with high career expectations is great as long as you have confirmation that you\u2019re on the right path. And that\u2019s enough for me because there are means of survival available, in my case support from close people.</strong>\n\nAnd somehow I\u2019ve managed to get exactly where I\u2019d wanted to get \u2013 I now have my first job\u00a0 or gig as people here seem to name it (=paid job) which is more important than the other work I\u2019ve done for free as a student and that I keep doing because it creates opportunities. Why is it more important? because it is better defined in terms of learning outputs, duration, responsibilities and does come with security. Financial security as well, I won\u2019t lie, but this is provisional anyway, after that who knows.. But security in terms of confidence in that I <em>can</em> find job even in this blurry, deep-in-crisis job market we know of, and that job can be of my own choice. Of course, I invested a lot to be able to have this temporary job. I went to summer schools, trainings and an internship, all of which I had to pay for from \u00a0a 100$ per month university scholarship saved. But I always did it with the feeling that I am growing and that I am lucky to be able to do them. I didn\u2019t have to take up waitressing to support myself, so even that\u2019s a huge gain \u2013 affording to fully invest in oneself.\u00a0\n\nAbout investment in another mission \u2013 Bring on the allies; my report is coming soon .\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-14 11:48:36", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 07:03:01.799322", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 565, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28430, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5196, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Streaming / Hangout</b>\n\nHi,\u00a0\n\ncan we organise a private streaming/hangout for the people in our teams that are not in Brussels?\u00a0\n\nDo we have enough bandwidth?

I see a strong similiarity with the <a href=\"/t/when-do-you-decide-that-running-from-a-failed-medical-system-is-no-longer-an-option/652\">cytostatic network story</a> in Romania, though I know less of it.\u00a0\n\nNo point discussing why these are care stories, that's self-evident. It makes more sense to discuss why they are open.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>They are open in the trivial sense\u00a0that they are not constructed on intellectual property rights.</li>\n\n<li>They are open in the sense that people can freely decide to step in and become a part of it. There is not even a real vetting process: the Helliniko clinic works by asking people to volunteer for a group, so that which individuals are paired with which group is driven by self selection. As for the cytostatic network, I guess that came down to people phoning up and saying \"hey, I'm flying to Bucharest next week, do you want me to carry anything?\". Implication: the people who are most likely to step in are the people who themselves need to use the system. The community serves itself.</li>\n\n<li>They are open in the sense that coordination and management\u00a0processes are relatively fluid. People coordinate using minimal tech and whatever works (Google Groups in the case of Helliniko). This is in stark contrast to,\u00a0for example, Airbnb or Uber, where every user and every provider interact in exactly the same ways, and these ways are encoded in the affordances of the respective platforms.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe they are also open in the sense that the range of what gets done (or doesn't) is not written in stone, but emerges as a function of opportunity, motivation of people on the ground and perceived need. For example, Helliniko does not do the same things a hospital does: it does not do surgery, and it has no beds \u2013 it does less than hospitals here, because covering this need would increase complexity by an order of magnitude. Neither does it do first aid, because Greeks have a right to first aid even if they are long-term unemployed. On\u00a0the other hand, Helliniko hands out free pharmaceuticals and even non-medical stuff like baby formula or food for (poor) people with food intolerances. So they do\u00a0<em>more</em>\u00a0than hospitals here.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhen all is said and done,\u00a0<em>everything</em>\u00a0in these stories is constantly renegotiated: the means, the teams, the actions. Except one thing: the people being served. In the Helliniko story, this is the local folks who have lost access to public health care. In the cytostatic network, it's cancer patients and their families, who cannot get hold of certain pharmaceuticals. The service is built around their needs.\u00a0\n\nFinally: these two stories are exemplar also in the sense that they can use small contibutions, like Wikipedia (as argued <a href=\"/t/collaborative-care-a-new-generation-of-services/464/2\">here</a>). You can help Helliniko even just putting word out on social media when the clinic needs a certain medicine, or the cytostatic network just by puntting a couple of boxes of medicines into your suitcase when flying to Romania. This does not make them more open, but it does make them better at taking advantage of being open.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-16 13:25:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.342394", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 612, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29815, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2362, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>mmmmm</b>\n\nSo how much money do you think we need to raise?

At this stage I think it is more important that we generate content which can be fitted into the standard proposal structure and I suggest that we only produce content to be added or propose changes to existing content. I don\u2019t think any of us have time to consider analysis and comment. This does not mean that saying \u201cI like this\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like that\u201d is not useful and I hope none of us will get upset.\u00a0Of course we continue the discussion here. But the important thing is to generate content.\n\nAs we progress can I suggest we generate a\u00a0 series of section documents and find some way of booking them in and out so that we don\u2019t get two or more people simultaneously producing different versions which then need to be reconciled. Each section needs a named overall editor who will be responsible for issuing pleas for specific missing input. Only at the latter stages do we assemble a single overall document for copy editing and polishing it will get too big and unwieldy.\n\nI do not know you guys well enough to suggest an allocations but clearly the project management stuff is with me and I have produced and uploaded some initial draft material as docx.\n\nRegarding the Management Work Package I think the consequence of how I have written the management approach is that, if you accept it, we could incorporate the management, governance and reflection into that package and that it becomes more than just the standard project management WP. Think about this, it could be dangerous or it could be an asset: the job here is to get funding rather than try to do the job itself so what sounds like the right sell?. The alternative is to combine governance and reflection with communications: ether is a good approach.\n\nRegarding the facilitation of reflection, I am offering myself as facilitator. If we get funded then you can easily oust me as soon as you think fit. ;-)\n\nPersonally I am on the road from Thursday 19 to Thursday 26 March and in intermittent contact over the net (Milano then Dossena Bergamo: and no it is not a holiday, it will be very hard work!). At this stage, and in general, think the best contribution I can make is in the generation of content which you guys can use, abuse or reject (I\u2019m not precious about this. ) You will get a flavour of my style from the first set of material I have circulated. I have a failing that sometimes I make by critique of the often naive and sometimes downright wrong and dangerous assertions in the Commissions programme material too obvious and an approach that says \u201cyou don\u2019t want to do that you want to do this. We made that mistake in the 1980s! and again in the \u201890s!!!\u201d is not usually a good one for convincing evaluators who are oppressed by too many proposals and are looking for any excuse to reject as many as possible as soon as possible.

A core aspect of the project is to encourage motivate, and indeed require people to pass on their knowledge so they can receive further small-group tuition. Formally the mechanism for this is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency\">Time Bank</a>. Students \"pay\" for courses with an hour of their time that they can earn by teaching what they have learned to other students.\n\nTechnically there are very few platforms for Time Banks, and only one that I know of that is open source is the <a href=\"http://actionhub.timebanks.org/help/whats-new-community-weaver-20-coordinators\">Community Weaver Time Bank module for Drupal</a>. Despite <a href=\"http://giving.nesta.org.uk/project/timebanking-uk/\">substantial funding however from NESTA</a> the <a href=\"http://actionhub.timebanks.org/installing-community-weaver-20-timebanking-tools\">installation</a> and open source support for this module seems scarce. So while I'd still like to track down and see how good this software is, and even test it out on the EdgeRyders platform - we've decided to take a different approach.\n\nFirst I'd like to say i am really, really loath to start new software projects - especially when we just want to customise and use a standard Time Bank in this project - that said that's exactly what we are committed to doing. The reason for this is that the idea we are proposing is both simple, innovative and build on top of a widely used platform with a great API - Twitter.\n\nThe idea is simple - to use Twitter\u00a0<span>as the means of sending and officially logging Time Bank transactions. It's such and obvious idea that i was sure by now it would have been done - but I can't find any reference to similar projects. <a href=\"http://www.punkmoney.org/\">Punk Money</a> was a project I looked at when it was <a href=\"http://dowser.org/punkmoney-pilots-an-alternative-currency-using-twitter/\">launched</a>, but I seen no simple project that is open source, and replicable in the Viral Academy. So we've decided to create one :) If anyone has a better idea, or any suggestions please chime in here.</span>\n\nHere is how it will work:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A request for payment: \u00a0\"@adil could you send us 2hours for the \\#JavaScript lesson? @twittertimebank\"</li>\n\n<li>A payment: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"@fortyfoxes here's 2h for that great \\#JavaScript lesson.

Skills learned here will be collated and together will constitute a manual for further training for anyone intereseted after the event. Have a read below and perhaps, at some point further on down the road, we can share the fruits of this experience.\n\n:)</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid48\"><span><b><u>-- SUMMARY IN ENGLISH --</u></b></span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid49\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid50\"><span>The training course \u201cBe the Media\u201d will take place from 17 to 22 June 2013 in Madrid and will attended 28 young people from Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland and Portugal.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid51\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid52\"><span>\u201cBe the Media\u201d is an international training course, focused on critical analysis of media and active use of digital communication tools. These contents and experiences will be collected to create a collaborative manual. So that, they are distributed and enhancing the multiplier effect of the course.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid53\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid54\"><span>Our reasons for presenting this project stem from our experience as young people working in media and communications, focussing on the use of social networks for the creation and distribution of information. We firmly believe that this knowledge and these skills help us to become well-informed and, as a result, more responsible citizens. We have also found that these skills enable us to advance in our professional careers, find jobs, and initiate our own projects in media communications.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid55\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid56\"><span>In the context of the current global economic crisis, which particularly affects young people, whose unemployment rates in many countries are around 30%. In the field of media added other facts that makes worst the situation: large companies trying to keep a obsolete business model and whose approach to digital technologies is not always successful. At this time also open new channels of information and business channels. For any young person who wants to develop a professional capacity in communicate, the knowledge and use of these new technologies and tools is essential.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid57\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid58\"><span>Moreover, much of the traditional media (newspapers, radio and television) are controlled by few companies. Much of their information is not always truthful and objective. In this training course we will allows everyone to have a more aware to the information, becoming more responsible and committed citizens. Features essential to form a citizens more active, better informed, more aware and committed to the strengthening of democracy in Europe.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid59\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid60\"><span>We believe in learning not as a passive reception of knowledge, but as a personal and group quest which implies dedication, organization, creativity, and responsibility. Effective learning not only requires intelligence, but also other factors such as emotional intelligence, motivation, personality, and values, and we will pay special attention to these aspects.\u00a0\u00a0</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid61\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid62\"><span>The constant practice in the use of new technologies will be a significant element of our methodology. All sessions will be broadcast through different communication platforms (blogs, social networks, video and audio, etc.).</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid63\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid64\">\n\n<span>Four sessions of the training course will be open to the public so more people can participate and learn about some of the actions taken by the Youth in Action program. In these sessions we will have a team of sign language interpretation; OjosQueOyen (</span><span><a href=\"http://ojosqueoyen.net/es/%29\">http://ojosqueoyen.net/es/)</a></span><span> in order to ensure greater inclusiveness.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid65\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid66\"><span>Broadcasting tasks will be performed by the participants with the support and supervision of trainers. The direct daily contact allows us to evaluate the rate of learning and adapting the training course development,\u00a0 if it will be necessary. This methodology allows us to make continuous evaluation during the training course. This process will be complemented by an initial evaluation and a final one where analyzing the implementation.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid67\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid68\"><span>Participants will be asked to respond to a detailed questionnaire, and the seminar methodology will take as its starting point their knowledge and interests.

Specifically, the seminar may be of particular interest to young professionals working in the media, unemployed or not, who want to receive training and broaden their professional profile in the use of digital tools.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid71\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid72\"><span>The diversity of knowledge and experience provided by participants and trainers will be reflected in a manual we will elaborate in a collaborative way through the course. This will facilitate the diffusion of this knowledge, and also the manual can be used as a guide for next workshops. The manual will be available for free download on the Internet under a 'public domain' license, so that anyone can access it, and use it to spread training in different cities and countries.</span></div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid73\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div id=\"magicdomid74\"><span>We will discuss the process and the conclusions reached in different universities to make visible the work of this training course.

A group of people came together and have, so far, distributed tents and food supplies to 44 villages. Their method of working is 'action-oriented' and not 'result-oriented', merely because the first thing which needs to be done is helping people immediately.\n\nThere are other interesting stories collected so far as well.

You extend your reach, but without large money investment and unwieldy hierarchies.\u00a0\n\nMaybe someone's already asked, but... there is a chance we might help you get funding for your initiative (if that's what you need). We are working on a sort of collective proposal, where the proponent is not just us, but a whole \"smart swarm\" of grassroots initiatives like yours. More information is <a href=\"/openandchange-coordination/your-openandchange-application-process\">here</a>.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-16 10:28:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.968053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 212, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17482], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28850, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4255, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Who is the community?</b>\n\nHi Ben,\u00a0\n\nThe simplest way to think about the community imho is everyone who is registered on edgeryders.eu, vocal or not.\u00a0In any way, I will not be the one who tells someone that they aren't (enough) Edgeryders, that they should be more like other Edgeryders, that they only matter if they express themselves etc. If something is on the table like this offer, you have full freedom to engage with it or not, to defend your point of view and/or explicitly disagree with others. Or better yet, come up with a solution that works better where your work is concerned - which I see you have with the unMon, and it looks exciting to me - as an ER LbG member and community member (see how those roles are not entirely separate, and one could easily take offence if associated with only one single interest).\u00a0\n\nIf you have another version of how the elections would work or how to have \"everyone\" express themselves (in your own definition of everyone) - which could be better although I don't seem to grasp what exactly is, bring it on and let's discuss it concretely. Katalin asked about why only 2 non-operational directors, someone answered, and made sense to some people. There will always be disagreement, the question is how much you can accept it on good faith? In the end you choose 27 roles for unMon, we chose less for ER LbG, and we will all adapt as needed, maybe try different formulas in the future and test? Currently it's 2 advisors for ER, so if it's that which makes someone say it's \"a farce at this point\", then what to do? We each go as we think it's best.\u00a0\n\nAs for the process itself, of voting / not voting, democratically / by consensus etc. and the community choosing how this should work, it is the exact reason for this post. I'm afraid though that you will hear as many personal views as people asked, and it is not ER LbG responsibility to tell the community how to behave.\u00a0\n\nI would never spend time stopping others to do things (which the others genuinely see as constructive) or make demands I think there is one better process, but it's not clear what that is? Why not let others know what is your constructive approach? Take more time? Have everyone write memoranda or regulations for whatever it is the community? To do what?\u00a0I really am trying, but I don't understand.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>\u00a0volunteered to set up this process of electing community members, so maybe he can join and let us know what our options are..\n\nFrom where I'm standing I see people who want to take this on and no one opposing. The question is should we trust that they will help improve/ clarify what is a loose governance\u00a0system and stay true to the values that brought us together in Strasbourg? Yes, we can do that if we trust each other. If not, than no rational argument will stand or bring people closer together.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-07 12:02:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.798478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 553, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28779], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29599, "user_id": 1639, "topic_id": 2286, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Cool!</b>\n\nHi Rita, sorry for the delayed reply!

He listens respectfully, and I am grateful that he is not a chatterbox. I am convinced he would not make unsubstantiated or irrelevant claims.\n\nIn addition, he has a keen eye to identify situations that lack substance. He can tell you about things which nobody has thought of before, in the most natural way. This could enable him to develop a keen sense of assessment and the ability to deal with gray or undefined zones: what it takes to juggle with ambiguity.\n\nHe can also recognize the value of people and he is capable of expressing positive comments about them.\n\nAndrei, who calls himself @TOOLosophy on Twitter, is able to observe attentively and keep cool in various situation, while finding the right thing to do or to say.

Again lots of issues were discussed, but the main theme of this gathering was <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-the-international-community-event-in-tbilisi/2921\">Spot the Future's International event\u00a0</a>\u00a0on June 24th-26th. We were very happy to meet Spot the Future's ethnographer <a href=\"/u/inga_popovaite\">Inga</a>, to welcome to out midst Lucia, who <a href=\"/t/hacking-back-my-creativity/3001\">joined the platform</a> just 4 days ago! Also happy to see in person again:\u00a0<a href=\"/u/boris\">@Boris</a>, <a href=\"/u/elene_margvelashvili\">@Elene Margvelashvili</a>, Nina, George and Andy.\n\n<span>The first topic which came up was the Twitterstorm, as Lucia had found us through that. After she was in Kyrgyzstan for several months, she decided to move to Georgia a week ago and found us through twitter as a result of the storm. Right now she is looking at all kinds of opportunities in Georgia.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter introducing ourselves we started discussing the event:\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><a href=\"/t/do-you-know-of-a-cool-venue-we-should-do-the-tbilisi-event-in-ships-squats-anything-goes-as-long-as-there-is-wifi-come-help/2974\"><strong>Venue</strong></a></span>\n\n<span>Finding the right place for an event such as Spot the Future is more difficult than one might initially realize. It should have room for 40-50 people, wifi, a projector, white boards, flipcharts, etc. However, the places which immediately come to mind are fancy-schmancy hotels, and that's not really what we're looking for. Unfortunately, <span>Tbilisi'</span>s one and only squadded place of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ACCTbilisi/\">ACCT</a>\u00a0was 'privatized' by a nomad and his camel and he is refusing to let<span> ACCT</span> back in. Other community places, such as the Vake Park protest by<span> Guerilla Gardening</span>, are out in the open.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Places that were mentioned were: Free University (but it is really far out in the suburbs), The University of Georgia, Georgia's Expo (but the pavillons might be too big), Europe House (though they were not good in comming back to Edgeryders regarding the previous workshop), Caucasian House and the Sheraton (yes, a fancy-schmancy hotel, but according to Inga they have really laid-back cool conference halls, worth checking out).\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><em>Update: Uli mentioned on the task we should also check out the Center for Contemporary Art and GeoAir. During yesterday's project team call, Khatuna proposed the Goethe Institute. Khatuna and I will sit down for a coffee this week and discus the options, But so far, the Goethe Institute seems like the most viable option: it is very central, it has a beautiful venue, a great garden and a place where we can get food/probably make food ourselves. We will keep you updated.\u00a0</em></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/tbilisi-show-us-what-youve-got-help-organise-fun-after-hours-activities/2976\"><strong>Social Activities</strong></a>\n\n<span>Social activities, or in other words: what will we do in the hours not spend on the workshop and eating! Basically what is needed for this task: Ideas! What could we do? The first idea we came up with, was to go and meet the activists o<span>f Guerilla gardening</span> in vake Park and have some social activities with them: play frisbee, make music, or anything they propose. Perhaps Nickda (Nika Davitashvili) can organize something for us? The second idea which was proposed by George, was to have a picnic at Turtle Lake, or anywhere else. We bring some food and enjoy the beautiful nature somewhere around Tbilisi. It's easy to organize, and we'll immediately have our evening food planned out as well. We can do several different social games, bring music instruments, make a campfire, etc. <span>Nina proposed to do something volunteer-ish as social activity. This idea was welcomed by everybody! Maybe we can do a clean-up somewhere in Tbilisi, or perhaps<span> <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-workshops-the-aftermath/567/futurespotters-video-intervie-0\">Iare pekhit</a></span> could organize a pedestrian action? Or perhaps <span><a href=\"/t/cyclehack-tbilisi/2990\">Cyclehack</a></span> Tbilisi would be interested in organizing something? Or we could even perhaps <span><a href=\"/t/openstreetmap-georgia/2989\">map some places</a> in Tbilis</span>i! The possibilities are endless!</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Update: Khatuna and me will sit down for a coffee and discus what is feasibly and come back to you later on this. in the meantime, please propose your ideas: you run the show! ;)</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/we-heard-the-food-is-awsome-in-tbilisi-how-can-we-verify-this-to-the-world-on-a-tight-budget-come-help/2975\"><strong>Food</strong></a>\n\nIdeally, we would love to make some food together. But unfortunately, Tbilisi does not have appropriate places for this, especially not for around 40 people. And while I was getting nervous about this, Inga said: \"why don't we do it here in Bauhaus?\" Genius! So we asked the owners of Bauhaus and they were very happy to host us! They said they could set up electric stoves in the bar and we could organize an evening there. The guys are great! Another option is the picnic as proposed in social activities. For both evenings, we do nee to see who would be willing to do what: where do we get the food? Who brings what, basically.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Update: if we organize the event in the Goethe Institute, we could also - most likely - cook one evening there.\u00a0</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/host-a-session-share-what-you-know-learn-what-you-need/2960\"><strong>Host a Session</strong></a>\n\n<span>We want the participants of the Spot the Future event to take control, we all build this event together, it's a \\#nospectator event! So, who will curate a track or host a session? Boris, from <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-workshops-the-aftermath/567/futurespotters-video-interview\">Wehelp.ge</a>\u00a0said he would love to host a session and that he would propose something once his finals are over (next week). Anyone else who is interested in hosting a session or curating a track? Please let us know!</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Other Issues</strong>\n\nFunnily enough, our new member Lucia mentioned that she is trying to set up a crowd-funding platform for an animal shelter in Kyrgyzstan where she volunteered. And obviously, Boris from Wehelp was quick to jump in to offer her some support.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWehelp themselves were looking for someone to help them write project proposals, and I immediatly offered my project proposal writing skills.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><strong>As the event is coming soon, we will have another bi-weekly meeting not in two weeks, but next week. Keep an eye on the events and join us to see how you could participate!</strong></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-22 06:15:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:16.869189", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1514, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 423, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 390, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_(This is an introductory text for a story collection campaign that we used before in Edgeryders, and may want to use again.)_\n\nAs we are increasingly connected by data, as creativity is bursting and the boundaries of ownership become blurred, we see people striving to build societies where the public is free to add, change, influence, and interact with their culture through new ways of expression: see folklore, graffiti, sampling, culture jamming, stereotypophobes (people who fear being stereotyped), or <u><a href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/09/21/on-performative-internet-memes-planking-owling-stocking/\">performative memes</a></u> on the Internet.

In my discipline they say <em>\"For example\" is not a proof.</em>\n\nThe problem with voicing opinions, Andres, is that they are not really conducive to policy proposals: and Edgeryders is, after all, a distributed think tank, called upon to formulate policy proposals on the transition of youth. If you ask people \"What would you do to ameliorate the European economy?\" they tend to come up with stuff like \"we should rein in the greed of the corporates\" or \"more space should be given to creative people and their ideas\", and things like that. Not wrong as such, but they involve taking actions on variables we have no control of. Incentives are lined they way they are; people's desire for wealth and power cannot be changed by policy makers; and, in a market economy, creativity is only as good as it improves the bottom line.\n\nThis is a really difficult bias to get rid of, even when the questions asked are relatively simple. I have noticed this: every time a city administration goes out and asks citizens \"what would you do in this square?\" it gets answers focused on public spaces: \"pedestrianize\", \"plant more trees\", \"bicycle lanes\", \"a civic center\" etc. But when the actual urban planning choices are made, economic interests - often of the very same people - kick in: shopkeepers want cars to have easy access to their shops, real estate developers want to build more apartments and offices, home owners want that too because they expect the values of their homes to increase. The citizens' suggestions turn out to be mostly wishful thinking, and therefore unsustainable.\n\nBut there is another way: to ask people \"what are you already doing?\". How are you using the square? How are you trying to improve your personal economic situation? This gets rid of the wishful thinking bias: if you are doing something, it means this something is, somewhat sustainable. By aggregating what people are doing in Egderyders, we hope to discover behavior that (1) generates desirable consequences for all (eg sharing assets) and (2) can be enabled by public policy.\n\nSo, this is why I have taken up the role of the boring guy who always wants to talk about action and behavior as opposed to pure ideas and desires. I really hope that Edgeryders can disprove the idea that citizen consultation is useless, and herald the rise of the <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2012/04/10/introducing-the-citizen-expert/\">citizen as expert</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-16 08:32:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.968776", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 441, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2119, "user_id": 51, "topic_id": 2086, "post_number": 1, "raw": "", "created_at": "2013-10-25 12:34:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.219442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17341, "user_id": 11, "topic_id": 1235, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>About sacrifices, or aren't they?</b>\n\nDear Noemi, thanks for your message,\n\nI had to give up things and make sacrifices, for sure, at several levels.\n\n<strong>On the profesional level:</strong>\n\nIn 2006 I decided to quit my job as a Team Lead at Hewlett-Packard Germany. It was a very nice job, quite well paid, with flexible working-times, 42 yearly days off (really!), and quite good boss, colleagues and subordinates.\n\nShort afterwards I wrote a presentation reflecting about all this <em>(to ask for some grants to fund the initial works of the association)</em>. It can be interesting for you, as it is very related with the notion of \"Edgeryding\". It was titled <a href=\"http://www.ckyosei.org/la-asociacion/quien-somos/equipo/servicio-sueno/\"><strong><em><span><span>At the service of a </span><span>dream, or</span><span>...</span> <span>the </span><span>'a little bit further</span></span></em></strong></a><a href=\"http://www.ckyosei.org/la-asociacion/quien-somos/equipo/servicio-sueno/\"><strong><em><span><span>' path</span></span></em></strong></a>, and starts with the last phone call I had with my boss...\n\n<h5 style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><strong><em>\u2013 [\u2026] You know, Pedro? It\u2019s not going to be easy for the team to manage the next release without you. Even so, I understand your choice and I am happy that you are taking a decision that is going to be good for you on the personal side. What you are doing is quite courageous.\n\n\u2013 Courageous, Francesco? But\u2026 I actually feel that I couldn\u2019t do anything else! Everything seems to fit now so clearly\u2026 that I couldn\u2019t help but follow this way. I have to chase my dream.\n\n\u2013 But that\u2019s not the usual way, Pedro. All of us have dreams, but for most people their dreams just remain\u2026 dreams; something you dream of doing, not something you actually do.

I've been living on my savings, and I only \"worked\" in positions that helped me to move further with the Asociation's projects: for an NGO in Guatemala, as tutor in \"e-Participation\" courses, some little paid research work at the Uni...\n\nI hope soon I'll be able to find a way to be paid for doing \"what I want to do\". Actually, my savings are more or less at the level they were when I left HP, and that means that I was able to \"survive\" all this years. But if I want to really create Kyopol, a more stable and sustainable situation needs to be reached.\n\n<strong>On the academical level</strong>\n\nAfter spending a year in Brazil researching on public participation and social movements, I realised that the academic area treating\u00a0 \"Civic Engagement\" and \"Participation\"was quite underdeveloped: it was quite disconected from reality, and was not able to explain the realities that I had been observing.\n\nThe situation on the \"e-Participation\" field was even worse, since most of the leading scholars had an \"e-Government\" background and perspective, and what they were producing was, in many cases, nonsense (see our article <a href=\"http://www.ckyosei.org/docs/TheE-%28R%29evolutionWillNotBeFunded.PROVISIONAL.pdf\">here</a>, that reflects on the development of e-Participation in Europe).\n\nI decided that I wanted my PhD to be not just \"scientifically relevant\", but also \"socially useful\". Not just writing a standard \"Thesis\", but a \"meaningful\", application oriented work. I realized that taking such an approach would mean... that it would take much more time to achieve it. And that's why, it is now, seven years latter, that I'm finally finishing it.\n\n<strong>On the personal level</strong>\n\nOn the personal level... well, I cannot really speak of sacrifices. All this years I've been just \"living\", investing on the projects of the association, doing what I felt that mattered. Maybe there are many thing that I haven't done, because of being commited to this project, but there are many other things that I did instead. Living abroad, working in extremely poor and violent part of the world, has allowed me to meet real heroes. They are the ones who really work for the well-being of their societies, and risk their lifes because of it. And sadly, sometimes they even lose life.\n\nThis live experience are very inspiring, and help to set priorities.\n\nSo... no, I wouldn't speak of personal sacrifices. In the last years I've devoted myself to work on what I wanted to work. I didn't have so much success as I desired, and most of the time I wasn't able to be paid for it... but I consider myself a privileged.\n\nI hope I answered your questions. Sorry for the long answer!!\n\nPedro\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-15 11:43:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.726835", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 958, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3200, "user_id": 2227, "topic_id": 3167, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Political system is a political and management system.

Here are some definitions of \u201cpolitical system\u201d. Political system is a conglomerate of organizations, interested groups (political parties, industrial associations), the relationship between these institutions, both the political norms and laws, and laws regulating their functions (constitution, election law).\n\nPolitical system consists of NGOs with authority. Political studies - one of the organic part of humanities culture. It includes the experience of many generations, who are engaged in the research of political and other problems of a government. The experience belongs not only to the government, but also to contemporary times, continuing to influence on political process, ideological movements and on political theoretical knowledge of evolution.

This, by the way, varies a lot across different European countries \u2013 and since we come from all over the place, we have a lot of latitude over what to go for. Whether you go for \"international NGOs\" in Belgium, \"community interest companies\" in the UK, \"social cooperatives\" in Italy or plain associations,\u00a0<em>you still have to be incorporated</em>. You need a bank account, a tax number, an address, a governance structure. And that's a pretty clear-cut line right there, separating a shapeless, ever-shifitng unincorporated community from anything incorporated. One that needs thinking before you cross it.\n\nI am confident that we can choose a legal form that makes sense for us \u2013 leaving, as you say, each one of us to choose which activities to engage in. Some will want to actually do the work, earn the money and keep the community services going.\u00a0Others (like you, and probably myself too) will keep to one side, interact with the community on whatever they are passionate about, and hopefully enjoy a few freebies \u2013 like somebody hosting and maintaning a website, scouting for more interesting people, and paying for the occasional trip to a conference. If people like us acknowledge the usefulness of the work of the \"business crowd\" in keeping the community going\u00a0and\u00a0contribute occasionally to it, then we've got a potentially sustainable model.\n\nOne last remark: whatever form is taken, I think it should not be membership-based. Something like Edgeryders works because people can freely move in and out without having to become card-carrying members of anything \u2013 and I am sure we have yet to meet some of the best edgeryders. Far better to have a two-pronged model: an unincorporated community that nests an organization. Then you can build a governance model for it \u2013 for example, you could implement an algorithm that chooses five people at random among active Edgeryders users as\u00a0a board of non-executive directors for the organization. Stuff like that. \u00a0Whatever is chosen, the goals are clear: allow each individual to choose their own path, including keeping to the present way of hanging out with no tasks or responsibilities; make sure the community does not feel exploited by the entrepreneurial people that put themselves forward to run the organization; and make sure nobody has veto power on what other want to do. This would help us stay close to our glorious motto:\n\n<em>Who does the work, calls the shots.</em>\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-26 13:22:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.483994", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3433], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13729, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 4643, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I agree on everything.\u00a0\n\nGithub and bitbucket are the easiest solution and are not locking solutions (with the exception of their issue tracking system and inline comments, of course). \u00a0\n\nEDIT\n\nNon tech people could use graphical markdown editors and graphical git clients.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-17 11:14:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.595226", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 52, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13551], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27759, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2006, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>This is more like it!</b>\n\nThis thread just got a lot more interesting. Thank you @mishek, @Vidrij_Da, @K, @Eimhin and of course @iamronen and @Nadia for contributions.\n\nHere's my two cents: as Nadia said, it's a balancing act between asking for reassurance and making sure that the caravan, as David puts it, stays mobile. Example from the Rockefeller Foundation debate (<a href=\"/t/bring-on-the-resilience-crowd/1851\">thread here</a>): Eimhin's sharp question prompted me to do some research. The stature and independence of some of the researchers who were funded by RF persuaded me that it was conditionally ok to accept their money, if it came on a good project. Then:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>on the upside, Eimhin provided a cue for me to double check my ethics. This made me more aware of the issues at stake.</li>\n\n<li>on the downside, he did not offer any help in doing that. He did not present a balanced argument after looking through their website, so <em>I</em> carried the burden of proving (to myself, more than to him) I am not some kind of evil corporate money taker.</li>\n\n<li>a more telling point is the following. Here's the group that ended up doing the work in the RF application process: Arthur, Lucas, Ilaria, Vinay, Chris Brewster and myself. <em>They </em>did not find any problem with what we are doing! Eimhin might still be unconvinced, but he can simply stay out of this one operation while still being a very active and respected member of the community.\u00a0 Everyone wins.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI worry about organizing things in a way that gives people veto power on something they are not contributing to. \"Who does the work calls the shots\", we like to say. Does that imply that \"who does not do the work does not get to call the shots\"? Perhaps that would be going too far, because I do appreciate Eimhin (or anyone else) to blow the whistle when appropriate, and perhaps prevent me from making some bad mistake. But yes, I am trying to embed a strong pro-doing bias into Edgeryders; at every step I try concentrate on enabling people to do whatever it is they want to do \u2013 making the company is a step in that direction, and in fact some people are already doing stuff with it. I think this focus is working reasonably well and has empowered us to get surprisingly far on very little resources.\u00a0IMHO Nadia proposes a good compromise:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<em>ask pointed questions, yes- but please compliment with at least partial attempts to answer them e.g. by researching for existing instances where people have answered them creatively.

The idea is that people can keep using the most abundant building material they have, which seems quarrystones, and the techniques they learned for using it. The problem with these houses is lateral cohesion of the walls (I even saw walls split lengthwise, one half still standing \u2026). Vertical cohesion is thankfully managed by gravity, so we are not having to deal with the full weight of the stones here.\n\nSo the idea that I'm currently cooking in my head is <em>quarrystone walls that are made by filling in wire cages with the stones</em>, in orderly self-supporting stacks like now of course. The wire cages would have a lot of wire for cross-connections between the wire mesh on both sides, and need strong connections where walls meet. About the wire I'm not sure yet, it could be either plastic-coated chain-link fence (good against permanent humidity exposure) or something like 4 mm rebar wire (available in loose bundles in Nepal, I've heard they make wire mesh mats for concrete reinforcement from that on site). Like some of the quarrystone houses, the construction can optionally be plastered over to finish it. Some design adaptations might be needed like triangular support walls on the outside.\n\nI think I should create a longer proposal for public feedback for this once I'm more clear about the idea, but any comments on this early stage are more than welcome.\n\n(BTW, don't care about the text size problems, you have more important things to do atm \u2026 I fixed it in your post.

The drive here is been towards bringing on people from Matera/Basilicata - however within the unMonastery we currently have 3 individuals who fit this criteria Lois, <a href=\"/u/antonioelettrico\">@antonioelettrico</a> and <a href=\"/u/ritao\">@RitaO</a>. Now as it stands Rita has confirmed she is bound to the project and most likely will maintain/reinforce a coordination role, which will be defined more by developing partnerships and long term strategy over individual projects going forward. \n\nYet we haven't yet developed a clear line of understanding for Antonio and Lois's ongoing participation (I'm waiting for them to fill in the spreadsheet) - However I think given that these they are of the profile you've defined in the call, it would be good to review how this kind of participation functions because I think to date we've been doing a bad job collectively of integrating them in a meaningful way into the internal working of the unMonastery. Which reiterates what we discussed the other day concerning the on boarding process into the project and the same process that will have to be faced with anyone that responds to the call from Matera. It's clear given our experience so far that anyone coming into the project with an existing life and network in Matera is quite different in their needs and expectations to those coming from further away.\n\nI bring this up for this reason but also because looking at current numbers if Lois and <a href=\"/u/antonioelettrico\">@antonioelettrico</a> desire to continue working as part of unMonastery we have 5 of our 6. And so the question becomes one of expectations and requirements for all those participating going forward.

Marc, you often talk, in your texts and presentations, about the importance of having well informed citizens. There has been about 3 articles in the Francophone main stream media about open government. Two in <em>Le Devoir</em> in November 2011, and <a href=\"http://blogue.marioasselin.com/2012/01/gouvernement-transparent-donnees-accessibles/\">one</a> in <em>Voir</em> this week. Everything else published in this area is in English, happens in the rest of Canada, other provinces.

He tweeted live (a similar event to the one <a href=\"http://askobama.twitter.com/\">hosted by Barack Obama</a>). There was few Francophone participation. Journalist Elizabeth Thompson <a href=\"http://www.ipolitics.ca/2011/12/16/tony-clements-twitter-town-hall-storified/\">reported in iPolitics</a>: '<em>While the French session had steady traffic, the English one was so popular it trended in Canada</em>.'\n\nWhy was this particular town hall so popular in English, and not so popular in French?\n\nI suppose that this could be explained by the fact that there are about 22% French-speaking citizens in Canada, compared to about 58% English-speaking Canadians. Furthermore, the announcement of an open government initiative by the federal government never made it in the Francophone media stream. They didn't publish the news, back in March 2011.\n\nThe language factor may or may not be of influence, but I believe it plays a role <span><span>in holding off</span> <span>open government</span> <span>in Quebec</span></span>. There are probably many other factors, like politics, getting in the way.

The Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, never said a word about these issues, not even when he asked the Deputy House Leader, Henri-Fran\u00e7ois Gautrin, to make an analysis about the Potential of Web 2.0, in October 2010, 16 months ago. <span><span>There</span> <span>was not even one public declaration </span> <span>in 16 months.

(Esp. of course for Yanis Varoufakis and Alexis Tsipras if we are lucky enough to catch their attention.)</em>\n\nThe following proposal to introduce \"moneyless Euros\" via\u00a0 clearing system is designed to:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>fix the deflationary spiral of the Greek economy,</li>\n\n<li>allow recovering of outstanding tax debt from money-wise insolvent taxpayers (reportedly over 60 billion EUR in Greece as of 2015),</li>\n\n<li>support the Greek national economy and create jobs there,</li>\n\n<li>reduce the economy's overall need for Euro currency liquidity,</li>\n\n<li>all while still keeping the Euro as legal tender currency.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe propose to implement this clearing system with <em>network bartering</em>, a technique pioneered on our platform <a href=\"https://www.makerfox.com/\">makerfox.com</a>: goods and services are offered in Euro-denominated value on a web-based marketplace. Intentions to order them are recorded there too, resulting in an <em>order graph</em>. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming#Variants\">MILP</a> optimization algorithm permanently tries to find subsets of this order graph that can be executed as <em>network barter deals</em>. In each network barter deal, every involved participant receives goods and services, and gives goods and services, and both sides equal out. This way, goods and services are used for payment. No money tokens (\"Euros\") are needed for such trading, which means that it works both under deflationary conditions and with monetarily illiquid participants. At the same time, it avoids the pitfalls of parallel currencies (local trust requirements, collective credit problem, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law\">Gresham's Law</a>) \u2013 because money is not used as tokens at all here, just as a unit. It is also not a problem for national or international trade, since most jurisdictions allow barter trade and treat it same as trade with money involved, for tax purposes demanding that all legs of a commercial\u00a0 trade are documented with invoices.\n\nObviously, such many-party barter deals are still less flexible than trading in money tokens, but this can be handled by using a hybrid barter/money system (like Makerfox's <a href=\"https://www.makerfox.com/company/faq/en#how-do-instant-deals-work\">instant deals</a>), which alleviates liquidity issues through bartering as much as possible while relying on money tokens for the rest.\n\nFor the Greek population and its public finances, the following template for a barter deal seems especially relevant:\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e9f0a6a565cadcfbbcf371120058c0138904daad.png\" width=\"424\" height=\"220\"><br>\n\nScenario: Recovering unenforcable tax debt. Citizens pay in kind, and government forwards these products and services to its employees and pensioners (former employees) by paying their wage / pension partially in barter value rather than cash. This additional tax revenue is additional demand for local products and services, supporting the local economy; it also frees up regular monetary tax revenues to pay for necessarily monetary expenses like sovereign debt service.\n\nEnd note, to illustrate the proposal a bit more: the barter algorithm we propose (nearly) does not suffer from the \"coincidence of wants\" problem of old-school one-on-one barter. It is a highly flexible, advanced form, made possible by mathematical optimization algorithms and considerable computing resources, able to find network barter deals automatically that fit the above template. Such specific deals will include additional participants as required to make values match up. In our simulations, concrete deals easily include 100 participants and 200 orders each. As an example, this is how one network barter deal would look in practice (circles representing users, squares representing products or services, arrows direction of exchange):\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5f2bd76a9f216e73f9ee8a6650b8ea0dd8df040a.png\" width=\"189\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Supporters.</strong> The following teams and projects want to support the Greek government in implementing the above proposal, either free of charge or compensated in-kind as proposed for public employee payments above:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.makerfox.com/\">Makerfox</a> team, wanting (1) to consult the Greek government on how to implement a network barter system and (2) to provide our current network barter marketplace software as a basis.</li>\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://epelia.com/\">Epelia</a> team, wanting to provide a custom food marketplace that can be easily integrated into a network barter economy and is tailored for direct sale by small-scale producers.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2015-02-24 15:22:39", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 16:35:19.318684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 800, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24523, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 3470, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Ciao @Alberto, I am afraid I can't come to Matera in October.

It could be that increasingly these two poles of human endeavor recognize this fact. At least I hope they do.\n\nOpenCare is built on this premise and so is our MENA YP project. It seems that for years institutions did not recognize serious dependence on the fact that @Alberto describes as \"the R&amp;D of society happens at the edges.\" But the world is so messed up now and in danger of cooking us all alive while religious militants bomb and shoot each other producing millions of refugees, that such august institutions as the EU and the World Bank admit that they don't have all the answers and maybe the search for solutions has to include looking into and working with people and activities that they may have once disdained.\n\nAnd on the other side, fringy people can go along quite merrily without interacting with big institutions. \u00a0Until they need those resources and services.\n\nThis was my experience living in a large intentional community that was amazingly self-sufficient most all of the time, except when it wasn't. And in the cases where it wasn't, the need for institutional support was critical to survival itself.\n\nThis included everyday stuff like driving on paved roads and even driving at all. For example, cars are not DIY. But where this showed up most critically was in health care.\n\nWe at The Farm became famous for midwifery and home birth. Three of my own kids were born at home with Farm midwives - one at the Farm in rural Tennessee and two in big cities. And in each case all went fine. No outside help needed.\n\nBut others were not so lucky. Sometimes a child is born with a life-threatening defect. And indeed this happened more than a few times. In those cases one's pride in going all-DIY went right out the window and the fastest trip possible to the best hospital around was the difference between life and death.\n\nAnother time, one of our men was harvesting crops with a thresher/combine and he stuck his long-haired head into the wrong space and the machine ripped his entire scalp off of his head in a matter of seconds. His life was saved only by spending a lot of time at the best intensive care unit in the region. Not long after, another guy was doing tree trimming and he fall out of a tree and would surely have died without the same amount of care. It must be noted that the bills for these and other incidents were so high that they contributed mightily to our overall debt load. We had no medical insurance and I doubt that a policy could have even been obtained for such a large group. (And this of course is in the USA where enough people think \"freedom\" is partly defined by making sure that there is no universal coverage. This debate of course rages on to this day.)\n\nSo whereas we did most everything for ourselves - we never needed tow\u00a0trucks to get a vehicle unstuck from the mud because there were always enough people around to push it out - at times we relied on the institutions of the \"straight world\" to bail us out of the worst predicaments.\n\nAnd I suspect that people in those institutions smugly thought that we hippies lived in some sort of dream world where we could make our\u00a0alternative life without needing help from the other side.\n\nCertainly in the computer world, large corporations like IBM and HP saw no need at all for a \"personal\" computer, as one example.\n\nAnyone who thought that misunderstood us. We never set out to dismantle or abandon large institutions. Rather, we wanted them to be there to serve actual needs when they arise but not to waste resources on situations where people could do something for themselves. We saw a kind of harmony possible between the two.\n\nBut that harmony can't happen unless those institutions recognize their need for creative thinking and doing from those parts of society that walk a different path than their own.\n\nHere when we talk about Open Care, refugee care, new ways of providing care, open source medicine (like Open Insulin) and the rest, I see it as similar.\n\nIt isn't one against the other. \u00a0It is that each needs the other.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-07 16:14:34", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 07:09:44.343316", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 878, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 14.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3613, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6211, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6178, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Some ideas for a theme at the OpenVillage event, work in progress.\n\nI\u2019d like to involve projects that are dedicated to citizen science in care.

How do they manage to pull this off and what are their obstacles?</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/echopen-open-source-handheld-echo-stethoscope/699\">echOpen</a>: open source and low-cost echo-stethoscope developed with a large group of volunteers</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.belgianageingstudies.be/\">Belgian Ageing studies</a>: highly participatory initiative that involves elderly people in the scientific study of the social aspects of ageing.</li>\n\n<li>University Hospital Ghent: making legal documents for studies, admissions, operations, \u2026 much simpler and more readable for everyone, in collaboration with the stakeholders. Particularly children are largely left in the dark by the dense language, as well as people whose mastery of Dutch or English is limited. &lt;More details as I look into it&gt;</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://futurefootwear.org/\">Future Footwear Foundation</a>: hybrid research project at the intersection of anthropology, biomechanics and shoe design.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSome program ideas specifically for Open Insulin:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>KASK Laboratorium, a lab in the art\u2019s school in Ghent, would like to do a call for students to develop an arts project/exhibition/show on the different themes of Open Insulin, to be shown at the event. They're now talking with an artist already working on those themes.</li>\n\n<li>Through @dfko we got into contact with Claudio, a filmmaker living in Brussels. He was diagnosed with diabetes at 35, almost going into a coma. He\u2019d like to contribute to the Open Insulin project by making a short film for us. We should definitely show it at the event if it goes through.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI\u2019d also think it would be interesting to make the\u00a0link with the other themes mentioned on the OpenVillage wiki by presenting our experience with the quest to secure long term existence of the lab space ReaGent. We have been\u00a0setting up structures to ensure financial sustainability and independence, providing people with a meaningful job, while keeping the societal mission intact.\n\nOne aspect that is relevant and interesting to go deeper into is how we are figuring out models to the share a community space, the lab, and how these can be applicable to other initiatives.\n\nThis returns in some questions that we\u00a0pose to ourselves\u00a0for our local projects:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tHow do you ensure long term sustainability for your project?</li>\n\n<li>\tHow do you encourage change at policy level?</li>\n\n<li>\tWhat have you learned about having citizens define and help advance your research project?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThanks for the remarks and ideas so far! \u00a0As we flesh this out further over the next weeks: what are some questions you would like to have answers to?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-24 16:57:12", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:36.399363", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 630, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 12.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4442, "user_id": 2609, "topic_id": 4409, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span><span>Hey,</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>This is an application for the community connector job and also a way of expressing my happines to be a part of this group.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>My name is Ana. I graduated Art History and during the last year of my masters program I studied one semester in Madrid. There, I visited numerous alternative cultural spaces which succeeded in offering educational programs regarding urban development and also \u00a0strengthening the community spirit and social integration. I returned in Bucharest determined to find such a space which would allow me to creatively interfere in the city's ever changing common spaces. So I joined an NGO that beside organizing cultural events, wishes to create an affective bond between the people and the city they live in, so as to determine them to act when, for example, a heritage building is in danger.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Presently I\u2019m part of a team that is implementing an urban education project for high school students. We have noticed that there is a need for students to get involved in their communities, and that is why we are focusing on offering them the know how and the tools necessary for them to act on solving the issues that concern them. The courses are divided in four modules: Community, Heritage, Architecture and Cultural Institutions. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Among other tasks within the Community module I \u00a0teach the children how art in public space plays a significant role in building a sustainable and vibrant community both culturally and socially. I also work part time as an assistant educator for a Montessori kindergarten which made me understand the importance of alternative teaching methods.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The main challenge I have encountered in trying to implement this project was the lack of support from the state public institutions. NGOs are involved in a on going process of changing mentalities and I believe that this can be achieved through communication and debates. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Now, more than ever, in Bucharest it is necessary that people with interesting projects to be themselves part of a community. There are allot of people with great initiatives who work passionately on their ideas, but being dispersed it\u2019s hard for their projects to grow and gain relevance. A community connector would link them together and help the people interested in creating awareness, social change, community building, urban education, culture etc. to gain trust and support one another. I believe that the hardest thing when you want to initiate a program which would solve an issue present in your community is the feeling that you are alone. \u00a0</span></span>\n\n<span><span>If we were to unite the creative forces of these individuals, wonderful things might happen. I think that people with common interests react positively to initiatives meant to bring them together. In order to do so, I would set up meetings with representatives \u00a0from different NGOs (for example Komunitas, A.R.C.E.N, Platforma pentru Bucuresti) for sharing their visions about creating friendly common spaces so that people would feel \u00a0they are truly part of the town.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Hope to meet you all in person!</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-17 15:56:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.918282", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 979, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8962, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4097, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Exciting</b>\n\nSo it's ON.

The people's money. Let me explain:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>It's not central banking money.</strong> In the case of the Euro, the ECB has the ultimate say, and a \"user\" of the currency doesn't have any influence on what the ECB does to it (LTRO, LTRO2, Target2 credits, Emergency Liquidity Measures). All that may be with good intentions to keep the economy up and running, but it dilutes the currency to the point where people I know don't keep their earnings in Euro around ... . Bitcoin excludes this by an upfront design contract right in the software: there will never be more than ~ 20 million Bitcoins around, there's no way to bring money supply inflation to Bitcoin (except &gt;50% of users agree on the change).</li>\n\n<li><strong>It's not corporate e-currency.</strong> There are all kinds of issues with the most widespread e-currency today (PayPal). We use it in an online shop, but dislike it. PayPal takes 1.9% for receiving money [<a href=\"https://www.paypal-deutschland.de/privatkunden/was-ist-paypal/gebuehren.html\">source</a>]. Given a trade margin of, say, 25% of final price, this amounts to 7.6% of the raw gain, just for the transfer! In the Bitcoin world, transfers are free (fees can speed up the transaction a bit, but are rarely ever used). Even worse, PayPals reversible \"soft money\" transactions put the seller at risk of loss because of all kinds of exploitable buyer protection policies. And that also slows down the transaction process (up to a week for larger sums!). In the Bitcoin world, transactions happen instantly worldwide, and are \"validated\" after one hour (6 new blocks). We will definitely start accepting Bitcoins in our webshop ...</li>\n\n</ul>In all, Bitcoin has many followers among libertarian and anarchist folks; they like it because it's a currency without interference and control by the state or any other central entity.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-26 19:06:04", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:44.735741", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 386, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24447, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 1851, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Linkage:</b>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px;\">Re the resilience approach:<a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/media/download/1439f964-b2a2-4829-8c78-4264a7151212\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.<wbr></wbr>rockefellerfoundation.org/<wbr></wbr>media/download/1439f964-b2a2-<wbr></wbr>4829-8c78-4264a7151212</a>\n\n\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px;\">If you read this throughout you'll notice it starts simply enough, relatively inoffensive, but into the middle their involvement-by-interest sows itself with articles and citations from CEOs of Coca-Cola, the World Food Program\u00a0and Dow chemicals on how support of resilience will serve their own resilience strategies. My point here is: Do we want to serve the resilience strategies of these kinds of forces? (e.g read about the WFP alliance with Kenya during the 2011 crisis there...in 2012 40% of agricultural produce in Kenya was refused by exporters for failing to comply with 'cosmetic standards' and was subsequently 'destroyed'.

Borchardt / @jancborchardt\n\nOla Moller / @olamoller\n\n<span>During last Sunday's meetup we managed to cover all points in the agenda but did so in a slightly roundabout manner, this was mainly due to the intersecting nature of each area. We talked about and expanded on a number of areas, taking as our initial starting point the internal model of what unMonastery is - we discussed work in relation to the Monastery analogy, we discussed project proposals, we also began to devise the structure for both the London co-design session and the initial Matera pre-event in relation to what\u2019s useful for driving the project forward.\u00a0\n\nWork and unMonastery; two issues raised and frequently questioned about the nature of unMonastery is it\u2019s religious subtext and the unease that this creates for some people, the second issue is the risk of becoming a model for the 21st Century workhouse - these are issues that must be addressed early on and \u2018work\u2019 provides an appropriate axis for discussing both.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>When the name originally evolved at the first \\#LOTE unconference, it was quickly adopted as a useful parallel on the basis that Monasteries have long served their local communities without having thier value questioned, it is highly unlikely that anyone would suggest the demolition of a Monastery, since they seemingly provide a form of value that is not easily quantifiable. This notion of unquantifiable value seemed to us the perfect context in which to work, since so many of those in EdgeRyders were doing work that wasn\u2019t easily translated to institutional and policy frames and thus rather than reshape our working lives to such standards, unMonastery arose as a space in which we might be capable of socially reproducing our work outside of standardised frameworks, thus unMonastery could provide us with a collectively owned filter for the necessary translation of the kind of work we do.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>But there is risk here, many of us actively self manage our own exploitation, spending upwards of 16 hours a day working, with little remuneration - as highlighted in the EdgeRyders guide to the future. This way of working commonly leads to burnout for the most effective amongst us, it is also at risk of creating hierarchies between those that are perceived to \u2018work the hardest\u2019 and the \u2018work shy\u2019, we want to avoid this. We discussed this and considered that whatever the internal culture of unMonastery may be, this is something we must face head-on from the start. Our conclusion at this point is the 8-8-8 Day; 8 Hours of Work or Service, 8 Hours of Worship or Relaxation, 8 Hours of Sleep. Drawing from the narrative of past Monasterian activities to establish a healthy structured working environment that allows everyone to live and work effectively - this will be written into all future lore as to ensure the working practices and rights of all unMonasterians. Beyond the question of individual working practices, Jan-Christopher raised a key point that touches the core of the unMonastery model, in stating:\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>\u201cone of the big problems I think is the separation of work and life. Living spaces are dead during the day, work spaces are dead during the night. Even co-working spaces are mostly just working alone, together. It\u2019s really important for people to work in one space (ex. office) together; on one thing to be able to concentrate.\u201d</span>\n\n<span>This question of space, will be set as a core theme in future discussion regarding the development of unMonastery.</span>\n\n<span>From here though the logical question to ask can only be \u201cWhat work?\u201d \u201cWhat will the unMonastery actually do?\u201d - which puts a strong spotlight on the projects present state, we have gone from idea &gt; loose framework &gt; public facing web presence &gt; ??? &gt; Reality in Matera September 2013. Discussing this during the meetup it became clear that in order to move the project forwards and better translate our intentions to our future hosts, the initial pre-call for application to the EdgeRyders network needs to go live, now.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>In order to structure this initial call there needs to be a structure for what we\u2019re asking and how this can be fed into the reality of the project. So we decided the initial application should require some form of proposal and to fit these proposals within the current unMonastery framework it should be split between a number of areas.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Those areas for the moment will be defined as\u00a0</span><span>Internal</span><span>,\u00a0</span><span>Interface</span><span>\u00a0and\u00a0</span><span>Outreach</span><span>\u00a0- with a view to accepting a number of proposals for each area. Interpretation for what each area might be constituted by at this point is open to interpretation by applicants. Internal: might relate to an urban permaculture project focused on food security for the unMonastery, equally it may focus on creating a methodology or an open source social template for reproduction of the unMonastery in the future. Interface: could take as it\u2019s primary concern local integration, perhaps in the form of a mapping exercise of social assets in Matera or a series of convivial events designed to better bridge interaction between unMonasterians and the local population. Outreach: would explicitly be focused on the kinds of projects that will be enacted outside of the unMonastery during our time there.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>These proposals will provide the necessary content for the unMonastery website, that in turn can attract others to the project and keep things moving productively prior to launch in September. How we manifest this on the site is still an open question - using Github as a workspace for illustrating development was one suggestion, taking on the EdgeRyders mission report model could be another.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>All of this is being fed into the shape of the London Co-Design session on the 16th of March and the Pre-Launch event in Matera on the 22nd and 23rd of March. At this point the intention is to use MethodKit for the London session, taking Internal, Interface and Outreach as three separate areas to map. The second half of the day will be focused on future implications of unMonastery - doing risk analysis and modelling for future scenarios. The Matera pre-event will be covered in a follow up to this post before the end of the week.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Clear actionables from the meetup are set out below, feel free to edit and contribute to them.

Appropriating the thing you wish to comment on is a fine skill, and one with great power. Art and activism is always searching for the sweet spot there, and it seems that this project may have had a good amount of that! the legacy being galvanized in the moment and consciousness of those who experienced it, and not left to corrupt itself or become bastardised over time.\u00a0 It reminded me also of the yes men. But with different problems.\n\n\u00a0I\u2019m not at all surprised that the experience of living in that life had a negative impact on the people involved. I wonder\u00a0 sometimes\u00a0that\u00a0perhaps\u00a0people don\u2019t consider the psychological damage that power brings, its easy to hate on political figures, what with all the lying and destructive behavior, but we all are/ can be governed by basic physiological patterns. There have been many studies to indicate that deception and thinking your above the law and others are side effects of entering into any powerful role. But politicians are just people perhaps they should be protected from corruption by having less power as individuals. In the uk certainly the job would attract a different kind if the pay was less.\n\nThis kind of psychological demand, also favors the compulsive liars and psychopathic/ sociopathic personality traits.\n\nBefore the media became a big influence on how we perceive individual politician\u2019s things I imagine would have been different. I wouldn\u2019t say better worse, common sense says we need to move with the times. social media and exposure are just going to happen, especially if we continue to have identifiable individuals as \u201cleaders\u201d. I know there has been a media scene for hundreds of years, but its only in recent times that we have been able to expect/ demand our leaders not only are politicians doing a job, but that they have acceptable faces, the right clothes, family life, can charm and talk their way through interviews and TV shows. I'm not sure those skills are as important as seeing the bigger issues in politics. It worries that the most charismatic will win over all. In UK there are column inches and debate time wasted criticizing what MP\u2019s look like, this is total derailing.\n\nExposing the media machine, tactics, lies and backhanded techniques party\u2019s use to get into power is very important, people need to be politically active! but I feel hopeless in the face of how the system works to encourage the bad behavior. We allow politics to be a popularity contest.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/politicians-and-the-constructed-image/10804.html\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-07 19:05:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.605013", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 490, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25058, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5688, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Completely agree with you, Rossana!</b>\n\n<em>Following this argument, the \u201cartefacts/services/devices\u201d that WeMake will prototype at the end of the co-design sessions are not the final result of the process.

Open to constructive comments, and big big thanks to everyone.</em>\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe fourth edition of <a href=\"/en/welcome-to-lote4\">Living on the Edge</a> (Lote4) took place on 24-26 October, 2014 at the unMonastery Matera and was preceded by a two day <a href=\"/t/hackathon/3275\">harmonious hackathon</a>. As with all Lote events, this one, too, was entirely organised through volunteering efforts and peer to peer collaboration, under a \"no spectators\" slogan. A couple of Edgeryders began to think about an overarching theme (stewardship) in June and initiated fundraising immediately, while the practical organisation of the event happened during July-October, involving many community members in a shared effort led by Edgeryders LBG. The latter is the social enterprise committed to supporting the community in organising yearly events where members are able to meet face to face, enjoy time together and dream up future collaborations.  \n\nSeveral accounts make us be proud in thinking that this fourth Lote has been our most successful so far, be it because of the <a href=\"/t/lote4-write-up/3856\">unMonastery magic</a>, the involvement of Materani and projects from <a href=\"/t/stewardship-in-basilicata/3826\">Basilicata,</a> or because the <a href=\"/t/diversity-trumps-ability-why-senior-civil-servants-political-leaders-and-entrepreneurs-are-teaming-up-with-hackers-squatters-artists-and-activists-in-the-name-of-stewardship/3842\">radical diversity</a> enabled valuable knowledge exchange.\n\n\n## 2. How many people attended?\n\nHard to count everyone. Over 60 people joined from countries like Italy, Germany, UK, Belgium, Sweden, USA, Poland, Romania, Spain, France, Greece, Switzerland, Norway, Slovakia, Egypt, Armenia. Up to 200 people were present overall in a number of public sessions gathering Italians in Matera and the whole Basilicata region. \n\nAlmost everyone contributed by facilitating sessions (the agenda was driven entirely by the participants' topics of interest), conference ticketing, communication and social media, building collaboration with Basilicata projects, collecting case studies of stewardship across the world, unMonastery venue preparations, video and photos, collective cooking and other logistics. If some hadn't gotten involved prior to Lote, they were surely onboarded on the spot (proof is in the visual documentation below!).  \n\n\n## 3. How could anyone get involved?\n\nThe conversation of any Living on the Edge event takes place all year long, so anyone who wants to drive it and is willing to take responsibility is welcome to do so. We have set up a number of web coordination tools to make collaboration easier and make sure new people find their way in. Here were some major milestones:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Fall 2013:<a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359\"> Lote4 platform group</a> set up (albeit under a different name) and open to anyone wishing to organise Lote4 or fundraise for it</li>\n\n<li>May 2014: A core team led by Nadia and Ben committed to making the event happen and initiated fundraising and partnership building </li>\n\n<li>July 2014: Minisite launch, specifically a<a href=\"/t/lote4-dashboard/3113\"> Join a team</a> page accompanied by subsequent calls for participation and for recruiting volunteer coordinators</li>\n\n<li>August 2014: <a href=\"/t/why-and-how-do-we-earn-lote4-tickets/3441\">Registration open </a>\n</li>\n\n<li>September 2014: <a href=\"/t/travel-grants-available-for-lote4-makers/3609\">Travel grants </a>announced</li>\n\n<li>October 2014: <a href=\"/t/plan-your-lote4-travel-and-accommodation/3351\">Travel and accommodation wiki </a>to help everyone organise their trips</li>\n\n<li>Continuous: <a href=\"/t/why-and-how-do-we-earn-lote4-tickets/3441\">Weekly</a><a href=\"/t/community-call-25-sept-at-11-cet/3672\"> community calls</a> to onboard new people and coordinate the work</li>\n\n<li>Continuous: Social media outreach, including a <a href=\"/task-3553\">#countonme web team</a> &amp; <a href=\"/t/how-to-join-the-lote4-twitterstorm-fun/3596\">twitterstorm</a> event</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n## 4. Tickets\n\nParticipation was not free, yet it was not charged in money, it was charged in collaboration. Almost everyone who attended Living on the Edge had earned their ticket, by contributing in advance or committing to contribute at the event or in the follow up (<a href=\"/t/why-and-how-do-we-earn-lote4-tickets/3441\">learn more</a>). Few inevitable exceptions were natural (last minute registrations or show ups) because LOTE is essentially an open event and the idea of tickets, far from restricting access, was meant to encourage and even formalize collaboration.\n\n\n## 5. Experimentation with <a href=\"https://pay.coupons/\">MakerFox / PayCoupons</a>\n\nThe Lote4 ticket value was estimated at two days of work and was to be \u201cpurchased\u201d on MakerFox, via a simplified network barter algorithm. Anyone who wanted to participate would register on Makerfox and order the ticket, while taking on tasks on edgeryders.eu. Once enough tasks were completed, their Makerfox user account would be loaded with the corresponding amounts and a deal would be made. Tickets would then be sent via email.\n\nThe below is a progress bar from MakerFox showing general tickets updates. Once a user reached 100%, even if they did work afterwards, we found it was too time consuming for a small team to keep track of literally every task performed extra. As we got closer to the event, the bureaucracy of having people sign up on MakerFox and report the work on Edgeryders made it too hard to move fast, and so we sent tickets directly to those contributing without waiting for the official barter deal to be concluded. Hence some Lote participants are missing from the MakerFox database.\n\n<iframe align=\"middle\" frameborder=\"1\" height=\"500px\" id=\"frame1\" scrolling=\"yes\" src=\"https://www.makerfox.com/tickets\" width=\"80%\"></iframe>\n\n<em>(If you can't see the list embedded above, <a href=\"http://makerfox.com/tickets\">you can also see the list here</a>.)\n\n* Read: the USD is only a denominator for barter currency. The tickets don't have a value on the market, they have 'notional value' only,  are not negotiable and cannot be traded, so they don't constitute income to any of the parties involved in an exchange. </em>\n\n\n## 6. Key Roles\n\nA small number of community members and/or company directors committed early on to make Lote4 worthwhile, meaningful and fun. Among the core team, @nadia did fundraising, @ben and @alberto took on the program curation, @noemi did communication and community management, @arthurd managed finances and had a final word on budget decisions, @matthias was the tech lead. @natalia_skoczylas was the conference floor manager in Matera.\n\nOther community members became heavily involved in the process and their work amounts to much more than the value of a conference ticket: @mariabyck, @lauren, @hazem, @nicobis, @anon, the case study adventurers in Europe and Basilicata, mainly: without that significant chunk of work at the core of the content production, we wouldn't have made it; those who joined community calls every Thursday and consistently helped with write ups, @katalin and @bembo_davies who took on the stewardship of unMonastery conference venue, and more that I'm surely missing.\n\n\n## 7. Paid roles\n\nLiving on the Edge is a community event built with much more love than resources. No one was paid for organising Lote4 per se. The exception is Natalia, whose work was already covered by a European grant. She showed a lot of initiative reaching out to us saying \"can I intern with you guys?\" Without her persistence and liaising work in Matera weeks ahead of the event, a lot of great ideas wouldn't have happened, so resourcing this coordination role in a future event should not be underestimated. The Edgeryders company which was fundraising managed to allocate financial resources from multiple projects to support a limited number of participants' travels and some engagement and dissemination work whose results would be deliverables in those specific projects (see Budget below). Our hope is that in the future, more compensation will be available and directed to Edgeryders members involved in organising community events.\n\nCovering the overhead: Edgeryders LBG will make a finance assessment and see how much money was raised over the year - the so called \"profit\" which is to be reinvested in the community and support base. A percentage will be allocated to community management, web development and business opportunity creation services, or any other overhead work to keep the infrastructure going, work that isn\u2019t normally covered by formal contracts. The company being only a year old, none of that work has been compensated, as of December 2014. Edgeryders LBG does not have any employees either.\n\n\n## 8. LOTE4 Budget\n\nLiving on the Edge was supported mainly via three sources:\n\n1. Administrative overhead from various Edgeryders LBG projects: this covered 15 travel grants, travel of some of the curators, printing and other logistics, and food for participants. Clients include Comitato Matera 2019, Unesco and UNDP.\n\n2. Collaboration with Comitato Matera 2019 in the <a href=\"/t/civic-innovation-network/368\">Civic Innovation Network</a> project: this covered work of engagement in Basilicata, video documentation and dissemination, as well as the conference venue (in kind).\n\n2. Grant from The Rockefeller Foundation: general purpose community software development and testing (<a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">Open Ethnographer</a>), as well as travel for 6 people to Lote4.\n\nHere are the final expenses:\n\n<table>\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"200\">\n\n<col width=\"100\">\n\n<col width=\"200\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td><strong>Activity</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Amount (EUR)</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Comments</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Matera engagement lead</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">2400</td>\n\n<td>two months, part time</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>unMonastery venue</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">0</td>\n\n<td>in kind</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Food at unMonastery</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">950</td>\n\n<td>catering and community cooked meals</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Video documentation </td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">700</td>\n\n<td>not including post production</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Edgeryders hoodies</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">685</td>\n\n<td>20-25 pcs</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Edgeryders stickers </td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">295</td>\n\n<td>500 pcs</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Printed materials </td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">350</td>\n\n<td>program etc.</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Travel grants for community members (15)</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">5918</td>\n\n<td>400 EUR average per person </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Travel expenses for core team (6)</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">1500</td>\n\n<td>350 EUR average per person</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Accommodation for core team </td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">1930</td>\n\n<td>for a week</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td>Dissemination at European events</td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\">1500</td>\n\n<td>500 EUR per person</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td>\n\n<td class=\"rteright\"><strong>16,228</strong></td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\n## 9. Resource-related decision making\n\nThe main decisions were related to offering travel grants, spots for sleeping in the unMonastery, a couple of paid positions, and food budget.\n\n<strong>Travel grants</strong>\n\nThe decision on whom to offer travel grants was made by the core team collectively and on loose agreements: first come, first served basis; that the person took a team coordination role or already earned a ticket, that the person has been involved and not compensated for work in the past and they are trusted to continue to contribute.\n\n<strong>unMonastery sleeping spots</strong>\n\nDecided entirely by the group of unMonasterians and reporting back to the team during the community calls.\n\n<strong>Paid roles</strong>\n\nAll decisions by which Edgeryders LBG is contracting an individual service are made by the project manager. Note that most paid positions go to trusted community members, and especially those that had previously done unpaid work.\n\n<strong>Food budget allocation</strong>\n\nFood was organised at community <a href=\"/t/food-at-lote4/3701\">initiative</a> and in line with \u201cwho does the work calls the shots\u201d. Katalin offered to coordinate, so it was. There was an initial budget <a href=\"/t/join-the-foodies-at-lote4/3729\">released</a> openly based on which purchases were made. No micromanaging as far as the Edgeryders company or clients were concerned.\n\n\n## 10. What have we learned about organising LOTE?\n\nWe love our annual community get togethers. They are an important opportunity where old and new friends think, work and celebrate together. We learned we need to start organising Lote a year before to give ourselves <strong>enough time to plan</strong> everything, involve even more people and avoid burning out in 3 months time. Since this year almost all fundraising efforts were shouldered by one person alone, we need more Edgeryders involved in this particular activity, the sooner the better.\n\nCan we improve the crowdsourcing of efforts to organise community events with relatively low budget? An idea suggested by @matthias is to create the next <strong>collaborative events <em>at cost</em></strong>.  Cost includes not just monetary expenses, but all the work: all the things people would not do if not compensated. We'd have a budget for \"unavoidable\" legal tender monetary expenses, and another one for in-kind contributions (labor needed in hours), which means we would not even try to put a price tag on the immaterial value generated, but only on the material value needed to make the immaterial value creation happen. MakerFox would be the platform for this, enabling donations in barter value for the collaborative event.\n\nIdeas have popped up on making LOTE more <strong>harmonious hackathon</strong> focused, to doing a walking unconference format (we organise a long trek and people do lectures/host conversations while walking or during breaks).\n\nShould we keep the same format or try <strong>something new?</strong> How do we raise the funds to cover the expenses involved and build a strong core team? If you have ideas or would like to host the next Edgeryders event, you can make a proposal and get the conversation going by creating a post in <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359\">this group</a> (make sure you are logged in).  \n\n\n## 11. What came out of the efforts?\n\nFirst of all, a core team of documenters were dedicated to share the experience with those not in attendance. Our commitment generated comprehensive and fairly accurate documentation, in <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/\">rough shared notes on hackpack </a>and also in <a href=\"/t/what-we-have-learned-about-building-resilience-of-community-powered-projects-and-the-people-who-drive-them/3847\">full fledged reflections</a>.\n\nA month after the event we have pulled the different threads together and have come up with a number of ways forward. We are dreaming of new unMonasteries, more Harmonious Hackathons and even a home base for the Edgeryders community. <a href=\"/t/life-after-lote4-were-dreaming-of-new-unmonasteries-more-harmonious-hackathons/3962\">Here is the blast and ways you can get involved early on!</a>\n\n<div class=\"storify\">\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"750\" src=\"//storify.com/NoemiSalantiu/lote4-visual-documentation/embed?border=false&amp;template=slideshow\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><noscript>\n\n<div>\n\n[<a href=\"//storify.com/NoemiSalantiu/lote4-visual-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">View the story \"Lote4 visual documentation\" on Storify</a>]\n\n</div>\n\n</noscript>\n\n</div>\n\n<em>Have you been involved in organising Lote4?

One of the finest examples is <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/\">SC!FY</a>, a young organization based in Athens which in the course of four years managed to get a lot of stuff done. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">My brother, George (Giannakopoulos) has been an Artificial Intelligence researcher who has worked both in Greece and the North of Italy for quite a few years and has had programming and IT consulting experience for over 15 years in the industry. He has been collaborating with researchers from both sides of the Atlantic. What he was experiencing as a researcher, was beyond his imagination. He puts it nicely:</b>\n\n<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">\"EU is spending billions of euros in research projects. Consortia of research institutes and big EU companies receive huge amounts of money to produce amazing technologies. Technologies that need only a few months of work to become great, potentially life\u00adchanging products. But most of them remain unused for years within the walls of the institutes that produce them. It seems absurd, but rarely does anyone undertake the little work that is required to bring top notch scientific results to our everyday lives. It is also common that researchers simply cannot grasp the direct impact a technology they create can have on everyday life, if applied in a friendly, accessible way.\"</b></em>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">He wanted to see it change - and so in 2012 he founded an organisation with a mission to publish and transform that knowledge into ready to use solutions. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">He could not take it any longer. So, he and his cordial friend Vassilis (Salapatas) decided to bridge this gap between research and society. In 2012 they formed <a href=\"http://www.scify.org\">SciFY (Science For You)</a>, an Not for profit organization that does exactly this: take scientific results, and then form a community of entrepreneurs, volunteers, researchers and end users to build useful final products to solve everyday problems. And they offer them for free. To all.</b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">For the first two years we strategically decided to prove that we are serious about what we do, we are able to deliver and \u2026 that we are not crooks (since trust towards NGOs has been very low in Greece after some scandals)</b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">We also had to prove we are using freely available results (these are more and more common in EU, which requires many of the research it funds to publish their findings on the most open licenses possible). In the last 2,5 years, we\u2019ve started looking for funding and this is when plenty of things got done. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">We have been awarded by the President of the Hellenic Republic, we\u2019ve built collaborations with most of the major Greek institutions - foundations, institutes, universities etc. We have a feeling that our impact is rather disproportionate compared to our size ;) But we really think this happens thanks to our focus on communities and our passion for getting things done. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">You can read about our work in our <a href=\"https://issuu.com/scify-scienceforyou/docs/scifyar2015_img1en\">annual report for 2015</a>. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">The model that we\u2019ve introduced to our work is to create communities around each of the ideas from the very beginning. We\u2019re also often asked to solve a particular problem by the very communities. This is one of the keys to our success - we\u2019re surrounded by people who want to see and use the results of our work. And they\u2019re actively taking part in the process. It helps us create a space where ideas, needs, opinions circulate and are being taken into account. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">SC!FY is working now in four domains - areas of interest.</b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">The first area of interest is care-related and it focuses on creating assistive technologies for people with disabilities, and on offering them for free (and under open source licences). Among these are <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/assistive-technologies/leap-en\">games for blind children</a>, which have been developed in collaboration with schools for the blind - they helped us design them, tested and now use them. The process allowed us to bring together blind and non-blind people to work together. These games have more than 3,500 downloads from all around the world, got much media attention - and we constantly get positive feedback from people using them. So we <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/assistive-technologies/memorien\">continue developing more games for the bind</a>. :-)</b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">We\u2019ve also created a smartphone app called <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/assistive-technologies/icsee\">ICSee</a> for people with low vision that applies special filters to the video captured by the phone\u2019s camera and allows users to read a restaurant menu or signs on the door. It\u2019s also available for free and under open source licences on Google Play.. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">We\u2019re finishing the development of <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/assistive-technologies/talk-play\">Talk and Play</a>, a platform for people with motor disabilities, that will kick-off in late September. This application will help people who can\u2019t move or talk to communicate with their environment, watch videos, listen to music, or play games that support their rehabilitation. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">We have created more solutions in this area, <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/assistive-technologies\">that you can find here.</a></b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">The second area of our work is e- democracy. In this strand, we\u2019ve built an open source platform <a href=\"http://demo.democracit.org/\">DemocracIT </a>that supports the process of public consultation, which is theoretically common in Greece, but tedious in reality. We\u2019ve tested it and presented to the governmental bodies. Besides, there is also <a href=\"http://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/civil-society/active-commons\">ActiveCommons</a> platform, which we\u2019ve designed to foster collaboration for the common good between It caters organisations, NGOs and groups of people who want to change something and need an effective tool for collaboration. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">The third scope of our work is supporting civil society with our IT skills. One of the results of such collaborations is a <a href=\"http://voluntaction.scify.org/landing\">volunteer management platform</a> - available for free, as well. </b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-610a564c-e544-4348-9708-fe9b540fad49\">And finally, the fourth pillar of our work is the Artificial Intelligence business. One of the outcomes of our work is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.scify.newsum.ui&amp;hl=en\">NewSum</a> that produces automated news summaries, and works in many languages.

You mean compensation (e.g. through basic income) not corporate (as in capitalist/free market/profit driven), right?\n\nI think both have a point. I do like the efficiency maximization that competition pushes towards (not at all costs of course), I really don't like that it is virtually impossible to fund things that are clearly beneficial (to the degree that they blow the competition clean out of the water) in the long term but they don't make a profit that you can capture in one way or another. To me that means two interdependent things: We need better metrics for investment decisions (probably accepting some uncertainty), and in consequence new resource flow structuring. Perhaps though it is better to turn this around, cause I am not sure about our socio-intellectual capabilities at this point. Slow trial &amp; error, although scary and perhaps too late, sounds better than asking the people who got us here to get us out again (an Einstein quote comes to mind). There already are a bunch of things where there is a rather strong consensus, and the results seem relatively predictable (also because some communities used them to good effect for some time). There is no need (and arguably little legitimacy) for delay in those. Above that though I'd want to recommend setting up a range of well monitored long term \"special economic zones\" (some geographical, others not), some of which should be radically different in various ways.\n\n2nd para: Hmmm... I think we have <em>some </em>genuine disagreement here. I think if you need to do a lot of different things efficiently, you need a lot of different tools. Losing large(ish) and long term organizations would be a loss in diversity, perhaps risking some valuable tools. I assume there will always be tensions, and conflicts, and no static conditions. In effect the disagreement on this point is probably not very large, as I am usually also very much in favor of small, sensible and nimble. The other point though concerns regulations. Where again I assume we'd pretty much meet after some more discussion. The thing is that (nano, bio, chemical, nuclear) technology is at a point where capabilities of DIY are currently positively scary if you don't have good regulative processes (which we don't have in every of them). That probably gets us to the point of how to regulate these things. Here I would suggest to keep the old structures for now but start complementing them with new methods. I'll get to how a bit later.\n\n3rd para: The 20% thing. Improbable, for each option - surely. But on the whole (to find <em>one </em>attractive option in the Venn-diagram)? Easy as pie nowadays! Due to reduction in (information) transaction costs. They can be pushed down by another factor of 10-100 using current tech if implemented with half a brain and some money (speaking in a EU context here). I think the rationale behind the 20% thing is the following: a) Doing things that you like boosts motivation. Thus you have less people watering down the passion of your workforce by picking their nose 20+ % of the time (and infecting their colleagues with that attitude). b) There is the problem with \"good but not profitable\", which a large and disruptive (note that these traits <em>usually </em>are mutually exclusive for the majority in free markets) companies like google can actually exploit. For them it is the cheapest way of running an innovation center, turning a lot of unhappy-hours into potential business. For most companies this is not really an option because they risk innovating themselves out of business (e.g. by making a product that lasts twice as long and costs 1/10th because it is made with a different process - that your competitor happens to be better at). Most companies don't want to rock the boat if they don't have to, is my experience.\n\nNow for a different way of organizing, I like the phrase: \"Simple rules produce complex behavior. Complex rules create stupid behavior.\"\n\nThus my approach in post disaster organization.\n\nHere is my currently favored approach in a large economic context, the \"Rule of the Hand\":\n\nIf you have income you need to give 4 x 1/5th to a minimum of 4 persons (they do the same, down to a certain level).\n\n[Winner take all &amp; value extraction disincentivized, more opportunities for long term post-factum payback, taxation closer to problem, financial flows more likely correlated to actual performance (also small groups vs individuals) even though less strongly correlated in time, potential to replace book-keeping with a witness system]\n\nYou have to pay some small amount of taxes to large organizations, the tax increases if you keep working with the same people only for a longer time. [Incentivizes some degree of flexibility and problem solution vs management, disincentivizes nepotism, money somewhar more likely to be smeared out and not ending up on the biggest pile]\n\nAt some early point you need to include some representatives of the most disaffected party into the planning process (they have absolute information access). The representatives are paid from both sides, but \"their side\" has overwhelming control about who gets to keep that money. There should be a (e.g. financial) incentive to reach a consensus which will for example give a bonus sourced from the global tax. The representatives may have to give up some significant rights in a contract with their representative body to frustrate corruption (e.g. through subsequent job positions).\n\n[Externalities reduced, early planning stages consensus influenced, social cohesion safeguard]\n\nThere are still many problems this does not address effectively (e.g. inheritance), and it would probably be best to have some basic income supporting this all.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-21 20:22:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.926402", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1007, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23034], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1630, "user_id": 1048, "topic_id": 1597, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong><u>My project</u></strong>:\n\nI am exploring how the cultural and behavioral differences between Italy and Spain influences the advertising that is broadcast in national television.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><u>Needs:</u></strong>\n\nI am looking for the opportunity to participate in the production of advertising campaigns.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><u>Offers:</u></strong>\n\nI offer my creative and photography skills to make advertising projects.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 22:47:21", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:55:51.273995", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 81, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27939, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1298, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Two practical questions for John</b>\n\nHey John,\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>it seems I have no access to the embed code.

A friend of mine has run one such example (<a href=\"http://www.fleetfm.co.nz/\">Fleet FM</a>) for 10 years and can probably give some good advice on setting up a freeform radio station.

Does anyone know the current state of radio in Matera? in a quick online search I could only find 3 stations: Top 40, Love Songs, and Christian radio.\n\nIt could also be interesting to run a Matera radio station over a mesh network intranet, does anyone have any ideas/links/suggestions?

[Kathleen] is creating podcasts on local people an issues in her neighbourhood, and may be interested in this project too. I mentioned to [Nat] an idea I had about doing regular 'show and tell' podcast sessions with record store workers in Berlin, and as it turns out she's already done something similar with antique stores in Istanbul. Radio can be the basis for educational projects about journalism, storytelling etc.\u00a0Educational workshops can also be held to make hardware, whether cheap small scale radio transmitters/receivers, speakers, etc.\n\none little thought I had as a symbolic community-strengthening gesture and branding/sting for such a radio station was to set up mics in the Sassi to automatically transmit the sound of every bell peal to the new town and everyone listening online.

Despite of being at a high risk of earthquakes no preparedness is seen for disaster &amp; risk management .\n\nAnother big earthquake of 7.3 magnitude hit the country on may 12. The death toll from 7.3 has risen up above 125, and 2500 injured and counting. Seismic activity is not an unusual for Nepal. The fault line runs below the Mehendra Highway but it has not experienced the such large disaster since the great earth quake of 1934.\n\nIn my time here I met people scared of their own houses simply not safe enough for them to return. I met families whose now homes are basic tents shared with friends and neighbours. \u201dPersonally the aftershocks gives me nightmares. I have disaster preparedness kit at the bottom of my storehouse - a first aid box water tinned food a battery and a torch light and so on.\u201d Says a terrified local citizen named Radha Thakuri.\u201d\n\nMe and my friend travel towards the Bhaktapur city it looks like a bomb has been dropped. Homes are ripped apart. We heard stories of survivals and stories of loss. The nearby hospital has been badly damaged and doctors were treating patients outside the hospitals. Rush and screams surrounded the atmosphere making me &amp; my friend realize the situation was being more and more vulnerable.\n\nSince 1934 the population and urban density has increased five and seven fold respectively. While the ancient lake sediments make the Kathmandu valley so attractive to settle, it is also what makes it vulnerable to earthquake magnifying its impact up to eight times .\n\nOn these circumstances people need to be aware about the challenges they could face during and after earthquake. The reason why most people died in the epicenter area are the following:\n\n<strong>Information flow</strong>\n\nFew training session conducted from government and NGO &amp; INGO level lacked detail analysis. Training conducted before earthquake emphasize key safety major during earthquake as hiding under bed / table, lean between strong pillar / corners near window or door. These safety tips applied by those people who lived in physically weak houses were prone to death. This increases maximum possibility of getting buried alive according to many media in Nepal.\n\n<strong>Research and implementation</strong>\n\nBuilding foundation need to be in stable and strong soils. In both cities and villages selection of the land with the best soil is an important engineering decision. But research part in Nepal lacks professionals and often fall under less priority. Thus soil nature of Kathmandu valley \u00a0and lack of research part contributed to the high losses in the capital with the overall toll crossing 4000.\n\n<strong>Reconstruction process</strong>\n\nBefore the earthquake many houses in the cities and villages were in need of reconstruction already. Most of the cultural heritage were built in ancient times. Due to delay in the reconstruction steps many houses and heritage fell apart and took the life of many.\n\nThe government of Nepal has prepared integrated action plan for post earthquake response and recovery as follows:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Constructing temporary emergency shelters for the earthquake affected area.</li>\n\n<li>Classifying the affected population for the ease of providing them with necessary facilities.</li>\n\n<li>Providing the children their guardian who have lost during the earthquake.</li>\n\n<li>Making necessary arrangements for providing the affected farmers with free of cost seeds and subsidies for fertilizers.

But our democratic systems were not designed to operate in such an interconnected and immediate world, and thus the requests from citizens -which want to play a more prominent democratic role- are not being satisfactorily coped with.\n\nKyopol attempts to solve this problem by providing citizens and politicians tools that promote a stronger citizen incidence at the municipal level, which is where the interaction representative-represented is easier and closer. There is a need for new tools and methods which enhance the ability of both citizens and politicians to work together in solving their daily problems, and thus promote a renewal of politics. A true democracy needs to be guided by an intense and constant dialogue between politicians and the citizens.\n\nThis is the challenge that Kyopol System aims to face: promoting, from below, from neighborhoods and cities, the kind of democratic learning processes that will allow us to interact with each other in a symbiotic way, and thus improve the political and civic functioning of our societies.\n\n<strong>THE SOLUTION: Please explain what your solution offers and how it is innovative. How will you put your solution into the hands of users or beneficiaries? Be specific!</strong>\n\nThe challenges that our cities face need to be solved through intensive cooperation between the government, civic society and the economic actors that live and work in them.\n\nKyopol System aims to make \"citizen engagement\" much easier, attractive and powerful, and thus help each of these actors to attain their needs through symbiotic collaboration. Through dialogue and cooperation, civic links are established and reinforced, and a feeling of \"belonging to a common environment\" is generated.\n\nTo realize this vision, Kyopol is being built \"bottom-up\", based on the visions of its future users, which participate in its design and creation. Users are the ones who know better their environment and their capabilities and needs. By means of a collaborative design process, users are determining which functionalities generate more benefit for them and thus make the system more sustainable and replicable. The interaction with Kyopol is going to be simple and intuitive. The features will be aligned with the users' interests: they will not feel like they are doing a \"civic effort\", but getting informed and taking care of things that are \"worth\" it and, at the same time, having fun.\n\nThe system exploits the knowledge that the Association has accumulated since 2005 by performing interdisciplinary research in Brazil, Spain and Guatemala. Web 2.0 collaborative tools and concepts are going to be integrated in Kyopol, to create synergic effects that promote enough usefulness as to attain the critical mass of users that is required for such a system to work satisfactorily.\n\n<strong>THE MODEL: Walk us through a specific example of how your solution makes a difference through use of information technology and media</strong>\n\n\u2022 Kyopol supports and facilitates public engagement in populations of any size, increasing the effect and incidence of civic collaboration. It supports both online and offline initiatives, and is available both for \"citizens driven initiatives\" (bottom-up) as for initiatives promoted by government and public agencies (top-down).\n\n\u2022 Kyopol makes easy for people and groups that are willing to promote a civic initiative, to inform about it to all potentially interested fellow citizens and organizations. Conversely, through a system of \"alerts\", Kyopol allows citizens and organizations to stay informed about the initiatives that deal with themes and places of their interest.\n\n\u2022 Kyopol promotes the development of \"high quality\" civic initiatives, by providing tools, methodologies and teaching resources that promote a participation which is transparent, informed, balanced, profound and documented.\n\n\u2022 Kyopol works, in short, as a decentralized and transparent \"Facebook of civic engagement\", which would be regularly used by citizens and institutions of all kinds, to inform (/inform themselves) about civic initiatives taking place in the places they care for, and deal with subjects that matter to them. Kyopol acts thus as a \"civic neural system\" for the city, which guides collective reflection and civic action, and keeps a transparent record of all civic processes conducted in the city over the time.\n\n\u2022 Using a fractal model of administration, Kyopol obtains a sustainable critical mass of users, and thus favours an exponential growth of the usefulness generated and its viral spread.\n\n<strong>THE MARKETPLACE: Who are your peers and competitors? What challenges could these players pose to your success or growth?</strong>\n\nExperts have long indicated that e-Participation systems promoted \"top-down\", from governments, are inefficient, technologically backward and unable to fulfill the real needs of its users. This is why the EU has not obtained much results, despite having invested more than 100 million euros in the last 10 years.\n\nHowever, the systems developed from CSOs have also not had a real success: they have not been able to expand its use virally, in a sustainable way. Financial constraints and a poor understanding of the environment where they operate prevented them from generating a irresistible \"usefulness\" that would have lead to an exponential growth.\n\nDuring the last 6 years our association has been researching this area, as a way to get vision, technical capacity and the commitment required to design really transformative tools. As a result, we have also established links with institutions and professionals who are now helping us to design and test a system \"that actually works\". In Kyopol's DNA includes openness and public service vocation: we will try to convince any 'competitor' we meet that we all -and the goals we serve- win more by partnering and cooperating than by competing.\n\n<h2>Social Impact</h2><strong>This Entry is about (Issues)</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.changemakers.com/issues/232\" title=\"Sometimes it takes something silly to accomplish a serious goal.

Share the story of where and when the founder(s) saw this solution\u2019s potential to change the world. </strong>\n\nIt was during 2005. This year I researched in Brazil -with a grant from the Ministry of Int. Cooperation- Internet's potential to strengthen local participation in Latin American countries. I studied various participatory avenues by participating in them and interacting with the participants: Participatory Budgeting, People's Assemblies, MST, CSOs, NGOs, political parties, unions, neighborhood associations...\n\nI soon realized that this puzzle was very difficult to solve, because each of the actors involved in \"Civic Engagement\" were missing some pieces needed to complete it: politicians lack confidence and will; activist lack awareness of ICT's potentials; scholars do not feel the \"taste\" of civic engagement, programmers have not experienced the face-to-face processes of social struggle...\n\nWe wrote some articles explaining the \"Main foundations to design municipal e-Participation systems\"... But that was clearly not enough. If we wanted \"empowering\" tools to be created, we had to involve ourselves directly to play a \"connecting\" role between IT and meatworld. So we founded the association. We have been reflecting and networking since then. Now, finally, we started to build KYOPOL.\n\n<strong>Specify both the depth and scale of your solution\u2019s social impact to date</strong>\n\nThe projects of our Association are currently at a crucial point. After finishing the research and pre-design phases (below we show their most important achievements), we are now starting the construction and testing of Kyopol, with the help of our \"Pioneers' Group\".\n\n<strong>MILESTONES:\n\nAXIS I - RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION (2004-11)</strong>\n\n- Research on e-participation and civic engagement in Catalonia (2004), Brazil (05-06) and Guatemala (07-10).\n\n- Experiences: ICT and municipal transparency (09), ICT and plans. participatory development (10). Indigenous region in Guatemala.\n\n<strong>AXIS II - DISSEMINATION AND ADVOCACY (06-11)</strong>\n\n- Preparation of articles, book chapters, monographs, audiovisual materials and teaching aids.\n\n- Conferences: Project perspectives presented in Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Guatemala, Venezuela and Brazil.\n\n- Teaching courses and seminars on e-Participation.\n\n- Price awarded at CLAD Congress to our coneptual foundations.\n\n<strong>AXIS III - NETWORKING (08-11)</strong>\n\n- Partnerships with institutions and individuals interested in contributing to the associaion's projects (see below).\n\n- Recognized in the field of European e-participation as an innovative and relevant actor.\n\n<strong>What is your projected impact within the next 1-5 years? Is your idea replicable? If so, how?</strong>\n\nThe creation of Kyopol is underway. 57 \"pioneers\" (from 7 countries) representing the various groups of system's users, are now helping us to create and improve Kyopol prototypes. Pilot testing is planed to start in H1 2012 at the Corredor del Henares region. The system is created with the explicit aim of extending its use \"virally\". In June 2013 we aim to activate it throughout Spain (see picture), and to start pilots in several countries in Latinamerica and Europe.\n\nIf the extension of Kyopol's use in spanish municipalities goes as planned, by the time of the next municipal elections (due in 2015) Kyopol might have contributed much to strengthen the participatory and civic landscape of many spanish cities and regions, and could thus affect significantly several election results.\n\n<strong>Winning entries present a strong plan for how they will achieve and mark growth. Identify your six-month milestone for growing your impact</strong>\n\nPrototypes have been validated and improved by Pioneers, and an Alpha system is available to conduct pilot projects.\n\n<h2>Six-Month Tasks</h2><strong>Task 1</strong>\n\nConsolidation of the Core Group and the \"Pioneers Group\".

Alliances with institutional partners.\n\n<strong>How many people have been impacted by your project?</strong>\n\n101 - 1,000\n\n<strong>How many people could be impacted by your project in the next three years?</strong>\n\nMore than 10,000\n\n<h2>Sustainability</h2><strong>Explain how your company, program, service or product is structured</strong>\n\nNon-profit\n\n<strong>What barriers have hindered the success of your project to date? How do you plan to overcome these and other challenges as you grow your solution?</strong>\n\nThe obstacles were much related to a lack of institutional and financial support from existing institutions. We have invested a lot of energy trying to get support from government agencies, supra-state institutions (EU &amp; OAS) and regional governments... without success. Unfortunately, traditional innovation support programs do not work well to back \u201csocial entrepreneurism\u201d. This has forced our project lead to combine his dedication to the project with some other activities that allowed him to earn his livelihoods. All in all, this has slowed much our progress. The lack of full-time developers dedicated to building the system has also been an obstacle.\n\nBut\u2026 to overcome these obstacles, as Peter Pan once said\u2026 \u201call we need is faith and trust\u2026 and a little bit of pixie dust!\u201d :-)\n\n<strong>How do you see the information-technology and media sectors shifting over the next decade? How will your solution adapt to and/or drive that changing environment?</strong>\n\nAs Tim Berners-Lee wrote in a recent article, \"the ability to engineer successful [web] applications requires [an interdisciplinary approach and] a better understanding of the features and functions of the social aspects of the systems.\" This is precisely the approach that our association has been working with.\n\n\"The Web is changing at a rate that may be greater than even the most knowledgeable researcher's ability to observe it.\" Internet is about to impact on our political systems\u2026 and Kyopol would like to be at the forefront of that change.\n\n<strong>Failure is not always an option. If your solution fails to gain traction in the next two years, what other applications of the idea could you explore? </strong>\n\nOur project is configured as a multidisciplinary learning process, which aims to understand how to put the Internet on the service of our societies\u2019 political development. It is clear that, in order to achieve it, well-designed platforms are required, which are able integrate offline participation processes with online functionalities. They must provide features that meet the needs and abilities of the citizens, and succeed in generating a pleasant experience of \"civic engagement\": it must be fun!!-.\n\nThat is why, if -for example- in two years we have been unable to extend the use of the system to the levels have set as objective, or we have failed to achieve the \"small critical masses\" that are needed to create an empowering participation... we will not consider it as much as a failure, but as a \"still unfinished learning process\". Everything we have achieved to that moment will be the basis for further learning and improving. Considering that, in the meantime, we will have been strengthening ties with other institutions and individuals who share our goals, we will surely be in a much better position to address the challenges we encounter.\n\nThat said, we should note that our plans include various alternative scenarios. These scenarios consider different ideas, features and possible uses of the system; and depending on how everything unfolds, we will give prioritize some of them over the others.\n\nFor example, one of the features the system should provide, is to be integrated with the formal and informal education systems. This way, it will promote a \"hands on\" learning of \u201cparticipation\u201d from the school. But this is not one of the functionalities that we have prioritized to be in the first alpha.\n\nMany of these features are meant to support \"business models\" that generate revenue streams that will ensure the sustainability of the system. For example, we aim to provide specific functionalities for municipalities, which will facilitate their polls, surveys, deliberative and participatory processes, in a very cost-efficient way. A town hall would be willing to pay a subscription to have access to this functionality, and thus the operating cost of the system could be covered. Crowdsourcing, advertising, partnerships with regional institutions, micro-contributions... are some of the many possible mechanisms for self-financing that we are considering.\n\nAs shown in the \"Spyglass Model\" for the creation of Civic Software (search for it in the picture section), we consider \u201cSustainability\u201d as a cross-cutting element that must be taken into account for all the dimensions of the project: from infrastructure for development and the base collaborative processes, to the institutional governance arrangements for the system. We consider that if the whole project is going to succeed... each of these dimensions must be sustainable on its own.\n\nIn the case that, after two years, not all dimensions are sustainable... this will mean that we have to continue learning and collaborating with others to achieve it.\n\n<strong>Expand on your selections, explaining how you will sustain funding</strong>\n\nAs noted before, the system includes several features that provide channels of funding: partnerships, micro-payments, crowdsourcing, selling services, business platform, and so on.\n\nHowever, what is really essential to promote the scalability and sustainability of the system is to minimize its operating costs. Kyopol administration is based on a model of \"fractal\" and multilevel governance, which allows the users to administer the system at the closest possible level to issues (each neighborhood, city or region). Users are also creating the content that keep the system alive. Thus, a small central team (in the style of the Wikimedia Foundation) would have the responsibility for channeling and enhancing collaboration, as well as to direct the improvement of Kyopol\u2019s features and procedures.\n\n<strong>Tell us about your partnerships</strong>\n\nWe have established partnerships with institutions and individuals interested in contributing to our projects, including: University of Alcal\u00e1 (ES), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey (MX), Federal University of Cear\u00e1 (BR), Inter-American Network on Electronic Government (INT), Escola de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de Governantes de Cear\u00e1 (BR), Pan-European eParticipation Network (EU), Inter-American Organization for Higher Education (INT), 15M (ES), Independent Municipal Party (ES), MuNET e-Government (OAS), Catep - Social Intervention Cooperative (ES) + many individuals.\n\n<strong>What type of team (staff, volunteers, etc.) will ensure that you achieve the growth milestones identified in the Social Impact section?</strong>\n\nThe project aims to operate with a minimal cost. Therefore, our process of collaborative design and construction has been structured to allow individual contributors to participate with just a small effort and without being remunerated. Currently just one person dedicated full time to the project. He is coordinating a \"Core team\" of 19 volunteers, and a \"Pioneers Group\u201d (alpha testers) with 57 members.\n\nIn two years we will probably need to have a \"full time\" team formed by 3 people, who will take charge of the development and support system.\n\n<strong>Changemakers is a collaborative and supportive space.

I met on that journey a host of\u00a0 varied, open, stimulating and cross-pollinating other 'seeds' .\n\nI am not going to try to comprehend it all nor to encapsulate it in a blog-post. I'm feel like a child getting off a fairground attraction begging to be allowed to go round one more time while being conscious of being more than a little dizzy from the first time.\n\nThe scale of the problems are enormous but the 'Edgeryders' see that, have a deep understanding and are not intimidated. They do not assume anything let alone some form of victory. They just want to get on with the work.\n\nThe opportunity to come together was a gift from the Council of Europe. It was wonderful to find that they were paying much more than 'lipservice' to the agenda and the people. I am currently, after recent experiences, deeply cynical about the political process but I am prepared to take the Deputy Mayor of Strasbourg at her word about wanting 'Edgeryders' to be a flagship program for the 60 pan-European cities project that Strasbourg leads.\n\nMuch, if not most, of the credit for that rightly goes to the 'Edgerdyers' team who managed to present a focused and coherent platform out of some the most disparate and variegated raw material it was ever my pleasure to encounter.\n\nI would like to make a personal comment here regarding a contribution I made to one of the plenary sessions. I did try to make a nuanced comment about the role and nature of the interactions between 'people on the edge' and 'authorities' but too many people seem only to have heard me say \"government needs to get out of the way\". I had hoped that they would hear me say \"More 'government' is not always the answer nor is 'better government\".\u00a0\n\nIf the conference was a storm then 'Edgecamp' seemed like the eye of it. It was very calm but with a lot happening and chaos apparent outside of our 'bubble'. It was more intense and smaller than the conference but I got more out of it and, I hope, tried to put something into it.\n\nWe are facing a rapidly changing multifaceted crisis. There is some overlap between 'the way of the edgeryder' and 'the tao of government'. But it is not as much as we might think and trying to change either would be a waste of effort when so much more can be done by each doing what they do best while helping and engaging with the other.\n\nI have come away with a clear vision of a few things I want work on, hopefully in collaboration with some of you. And, as we scale this mountain of challenges,\u00a0 I hope to bump into the rest of you from time to time, to share experiences, to assist and to have some fun along the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-24 12:13:52", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 14:57:59.527081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 579, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24024, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3027, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>whom to trust</b>\n\n@Alberto, you said you have faith in yourself and the people you do work with. I don't think that fits the way the unMonastery works, at least in my eyes.\u00a0\n\nWe used to say that we trusted the process. It was such an easy way to justify letting things take their own path that it did not even seem important to analyse what we meant by it. In retrospect, I think what was trusted is the group, the whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. So, no I, and no other. Just an us. This us had to be brought to life and nurtured, which happened in the circles, at morning practice, and by eating together. Issues of any scale had a chance to appear within the group before they went public. And it was just right - having a conversation is a much more effective tool for facilitating different viewpoints and opinions than posting on the ER platform.\u00a0\n\nWhat I see as one of the key elements of the unMonastery is that it has the ability to create a community out of complete strangers within a very short time period. And in the last 4 months this has been constantly undermined by the different expectations for communication: the where and how of reporting problems, \u00a0listing achievements and soliciting solutions. The details here matter, but I will not get into it now. In my recollection, the real crises started when the group as a unit was disrespected.\u00a0\n\nI understand that the Edgeryders, at least some of them, consider unMonastery as their own community. It is however really important to differentiate between members of the community who (at least temporarily) suspended their lives, moved out of their comfort zone, gave up their usual support network, their living, eating and sleeping habits, and moved into an unfinished building with a few strangers; and other members of the community who safely continued their daily lives and looked in from the outside. A very moderate version of giving up worldly belongings, but still, joining the unMonastery started with making oneself vulnerable and feeling somewhat powerless. No family members, no financial assets, no familiar situations, just a group of strangers and an obviously enormous amount of work to do. For each of us, becoming part of the group was essential, a natural human need to belong, to feel safe and competent to do the work we all pledged to do. And it had to start with becoming a group. The pleasantness of our days, the restfulness of the nights, and our self-esteem were hinged on our ability to fit in.This commitment to each other is what created the unMonastery in Matera in my opinion. And the group is a useful tool for overcoming problems - it has the ability to form a padding around each of our peculiarities and shortcomings. Some people jump into projects and rush forward, and they create a momentum for others who need more time to ease into action. Some people make connections with people quicker, and deeper, than others, even despite of language barriers, and so draw a social circle around all unMonasterians, which allows the less smooth unMonks to be understood instead of being rejected by the local community - we vouchsafe for each other. I find the idea of an identifier appealing, although I do not think the right way has been found yet. We are primarily present here in Matera as a group. It does not mean we have become uniform, or even similar, at the expense of individuality. In fact, trusting the process is trusting the differences within the group so that the consensus seeking process ends with the best solution.\n\nYour picture of the unpoliticking Benedictine monks is too rosy to be true. Gossiping (<span><a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674363366\">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674363366</a>)</span>, and therefore scheming, or forging and severing of alliances, is part of what creates social cohesion. I assume the Benedictines were, on the other hand, more careful about keeping it in its place. A personal opinion or a fleeting idea should not have the chance to be read as a State of the Union speech. I remember the conflict about the inheritance of the building - when we were told that everything should be posted on the Edgeryders platform. I really completely disagree. I do not see too much politicking going on at the unMonastery - what I see is personal opinions, suggestions and ideas get blown out of proportion due their appearance on the platform, while others remain humbly by the kitchen counter. I guess it is the big task for Edgeryders after all, to figure out their relationship with the projects under their care. I recommend walking softly.\n\nOne more thing - I imagine that it was not a rhetorical move from Ben to mention alienation. The translator absorbs the trauma of both sides, and he is the person who understands the background for most of the different sides when there is a conflict. And is pretty much left alone to deal with the burden of comprehension.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-02 20:17:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.186655", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 896, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8147, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 4143, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Done...</b>\n\nI've registered for this....\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-25 13:55:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.270800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24161, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2931, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Really like it</b>\n\nWell done, seriously.

Some ambitious objectives or aims that I want to see realised are....\u00a0\n\nI totally agree with Noemi: \"local (online) community building &amp; deployment of ICT and collaboration tools to support social / civic innovation projects\"\n\nThe target would be either policy makers (regional governments or local governments) either local communities through NGOs.\u00a0\n\n2. Somethings that could contribute towards them happening are....\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Research phase: mapping similar global communities based in Europe (but not only) which are developing online collaboration tools so we don't replicate but build upon and create bridges + mapping local organizations like Noemi said, which are willing to partner with us and do the field work\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Deployment phase: I would mix 2 approaches in community building, both online and offline. There is this tension which I experienced with Matera which is that there is this global pool of knowledge which is generated online, but it seems as if locally - although there may be people that feed and nourish that pool of knowledge - if one activates online collaboration, it does replicate bad habits of social relations. How can we link the short relationships and knowledge built locally to this global online community without falling into the \"international cooperation dilemma\" where people from abroad come and help out the locals through ngo intermediaries?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Profiling the target: I would position ourselves as an open consultancy to regional and local governments in order to get to local communities and merge knowledge with them. Instead of the old method where you would get over-paid consultants to write reports and do researches that would mostly stay in the governmen'ts drawers, we would secure a protocol method which actually deploys Edgeryders on the ground and tackles certains policy issues (kids drop out, waste management, ecc) through creative methods, using both digital tools and community management methodologies (for example, I was looking into a project proposal for H2020 on gamification and waste management).\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n3. I would know we had succeeded through....\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Designing ICT collaborative tools for local problems with the locals, maybe even with the kids (I'm writing as I think) which wold then themselces manage these tools and use them.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Modelizing a partnership agreement with local government which can be replicated and used by other cities</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n4. Something we would need to build/ make happen in order to get closer to the goal is....\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>identifying a model which guarantees recognition of the work done by core group of Edgeryders. Call it <a href=\"/t/social-capital-for-social-ventures/314\">Social Capital for Social Ventures</a> or whatever else.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n5. What would you need to figure out to be able to do so? what questions need to be answered? (that could need research attention directed to)?\n\nMap H2020 funding opportunities (like <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-issi-2015-1.html\">this</a>?), make a calendar of the calls, see partner search.\n\n6. What hypothesis do we have that we would like to test with others?\n\n7. What would be required for me to the people we want to engage to be able to get involved? To want to contribute on volunteer basis?\u00a0\n\nRecognition of the work. Thing is recognition means many different things: visibility for some, efficacity for others, professionality for the most, ecc. As long as we learn and we grow in a harmonious context it's okay: if it becomes stressful, generates anxiety and becomes rough, I wouldn't go for it. If I get it right, we are speaking of volunteering for the writing of the calls, because if we get the funding, it's 100% costs covered plus (some calls) 25% more of overheads.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-25 12:48:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.273890", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 675, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20681, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1362, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Making a living in the short term- how do we do it?</b>\n\nHi Chris and Pete,\n\n. Making a living is top of mind for me at the moment. For many reasons. I went over this again as I'm trying to sort my own thoughts out and summarised the insights from the post and end it with a question I really to explore with others....\n\nHow to make a living on the Edge based on Pete's experiences:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Chase Buzz terms: Try new technologies out and become proficient at using them</li>\n\n<li>Do temporary jobs to pay rent and bills (how much do you need/ month &amp; what\u2019s minimum wage?)</li>\n\n<li>Experiment with different forms of self-expression to tell stories about who you are and the worlds you live in till you find your style that resonates with more people- especially writing. Pick something which you can do consistently over a long period of time so people can find you and you can develop an audience:<em> \u201cIt's about taking control and responsibility for your activities and presence and not complaining that the system doesn't let you do that - forget the system, I'll make my own way\u201d</em>\n</li>\n\n<li>Be open and social: make it easy for others who might be interested in what you do to find and engage with you. Pete did it by telling people where he would be on a regular basis and inviting people to come meet him there to talk about social media, offering to help newbies get started, or those curious to explore it a bit without a major commitment.</li>\n\n</ol>Ok so it seems you can make it by doing a combination of temporary work to pay the bills and creative exploration of your environment to move you forward in the long run. My big question here has to do the time frame- Cash in hand, Short term, medium term, long term work- Highly specialised or skilled vs generic, specific vs fuzzy descriptions. How to find it as individual, as group as community?\n\nI\u2019ll take my own example:\u00a0 At a certain point in my working life I ended up working as a cook in restaurants. I only did it for a while, and didn\u2019t have any professional training- but I did get it through a job centre. Turns out the job itself was over hyped- all it really required was that you show up, peel a lot of vegetables, heat and serve pre-processes foods and clean up meticulously after each working day. The job description made it out to be a highly demanding job requiring specialist skills but it really wasn\u2019t, they could just have said:\u00a0 We\u2019re looking for person to mostly prepare pre-processed foods and a couple of salads every now and then. You need to be clean, have high work ethic and be willing to do repetitive tasks but on the upside the money\u2019s not bad. There is no way from the description I could have guessed what it was about, and if they had asked about qualifications I would have been filtered out as a candidate even though the job certainly didn\u2019t require it.\n\nLong term is off- I don\u2019t believe it is possible to plan long term anymore, not when it comes to paid work. So I am asking myself what cash in hand or short term work is out there? Babysitting, gardening, selling stuff on the beach. There never seem to be enough plumbers and electricians around.

A big event in which everybody makes pasta (women, men and children) and then we eat all together.\n\nWhy create such en event during the Unmonastery festival?\n\nSocial eating helps people interacting and creating bonds. It's something intimate and go beyond any language limit.Cooking together makes the experience even richer and offers the opportunity to share with others.\n\nIt's a perfect meeting day for materani and edgeryders!\u00a0\n\nWhy cooking pasta?\n\nHard wheat is one of the typical product of southern Italy and therefore of Basicalata.\u00a0\n\nMaking pasta is a real creative and creating process made by very simple and poor ingredients, water and flour and nevertheless it is delicious.\n\nMaking pasta doesn't necessarily demand particular abilities, but it surely requires time and to be motivated. It can be done by young or seniors and middle-age people. It is an activity that takes place around a table and thus stimulates conversation and \"gossip\".\n\nHow does it work?\u00a0\n\nA community of people interested in participating decides the recipe that will be realized, for instance typical dishes from Matera, like \"lagane con i ceci\", or \"tagliatelle con cicerchie\", or typical pasta shapes like orecchiette, cavatelli,cazzatelli or maccheronatelli.\n\nResources\n\nLike any Italian city Matera hosts all along the year local festivals (sagre) with street food around one seasonal product or dish, for instance wine at the beginning of October. Those festivals are organised by local associations that provide equipment : tables, benches, cookers and cooking stuff, and a great number of volunteers.\n\nThe aims of these associations is usually to animate the local community and they will be probably interested in doing the same in the occasion of the unmonastery festival.\n\nIngredients like flour and vegetable can be furnished by local enterprises that will have visibility in exchange of a very low investment.\n\nAll the necessary equipment to make pasta ( a wood working plan, rolling pins and knives if needed) can be found in every Italian house and will be furnish by the community of people themselves.\n\nWhat is needed\n\nVolunteers to manage logistics, to animate and coordinate the stuff of people doing pasta, cooking, serving at table, washing dishes.\n\nLooking forward to...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-05 15:07:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:09.499709", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [196, 1438, 1457, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7118, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4025, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Hey Alberto</b>\n\nI've been trying to contact you for a couple of weeks now.\n\nIs there a publicly available email, apart from the contact [at] cottica.net, that you use?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-01 14:56:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.952294", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 40, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21840, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1125, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Still waiting on a room count from the architects, so we can figure out exactly what capacity looks like.

The whole social cohesion industry is based on the notion of \"vulnerable groups\". People belong to such groups if they bear the markers of some kind of disadvantage, for example the dark (or light) skin of an ethnic minority, or a physical or mental disability. Belonging to vulnerable groups can be temporary: for example, there is a group called \"the unemployed\", thought to merit special care, even though no one is born into this group. \n\nLike many people around here, I dislike the notion. There are two problems:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Labelling. People are included in a \"vulnerable group\" by somone sticking a label on them. I am a migrant. You are a female. He is transgender. The labels are not incorrect, but they imply that my having migrated is what is important about me. When providing care, the label will be inspiring the design of the services that target me. </li>\n\n<li>\"Representative agent\". Once they have a group to service, care providers set up services with the average component of that group in mind. This activity misses out on the richness of human diversity, and it usually ends up mass-producing services that suck. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\nRight now, we are seeing the damage done by this concept in the so-called migrants issue in Europe. A Syrian doctor (or engineer, or carpenter) is labeled a refugee and stuck in a camp, where another doctor (European) will assess his health. He might be ten times more experienced than his European colleague, but he is not allowed to diagnose himself and others because \u2013 guess what \u2013 in that context he \"is\" a not a doctor, but a refugee.\n\n@alex_levene told me a funny-heartbreaking story from The Jungle (<a href=\"/t/welcome-to-the-jungle-weve-got-fun-and-games/625\">check out his post</a>, it's really interesting). He talked to an Afghan guy in the camp. He fled Afghanistan because he is an atheist, and that's led him to trouble. He wants to live in a place where agnosticism is common, bigotry can't touch him and nobody cares what you pray to. And there he is, in a refugee camp, surrounded by muslims, and everyone goes to great lengths to do everything in a way that will work for muslims. They assume that, since he is Afghan and the average afghan is muslim, he must be muslim: when in fact he is <em>persecuted</em> by muslims.", "created_at": "2016-05-03 09:49:39", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 08:07:13.475392", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 424, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32022, "user_id": 3038, "topic_id": 4974, "post_number": 31, "raw": "<b>Thank You!</b>\n\n<span>Lovely, I definitely will try this!

Poland most likely is the only country in the world that had abortions legal by law (1956-1993) and changed it \"backward\".\u00a0We ended up having <a href=\"http://worldabortionlaws.com\">one of the most restrictive laws in the world</a>, and the legislators were smart, by\u00a0avoiding criminalizing women (with whom society would sympathize) and focusing instead on everyone else who assists with abortions (the penalties are up to 8 years in prison), creating a system of fear and paranoia.\u00a0\n\nThe first thing that strikes\u00a0about abortion in Poland is the statistics - according to Polish Ministry of Health in 2013, there were 744 legal abortions and 718 of them due to the risk of birth defects. 3 of them due to rape and 23 due to the risk posed to women health. In 2015 there were 1044 legal abortions. For a country with 38 million inhabitants, these numbers seem just wrong. In Spain or UK, these numbers are 200 or 400 times higher. And it's estimated that illegal abortions every year account for between 80.000- 200.000 cases in Poland.\u00a0\n\nSo, what kind of abortions are available in the underground and how do women access it?\n\nChirurgical abortions are one of the common ways. They\u00a0usually happen in\u00a0hidden spaces, often barely up to any standards, with basic equipment, sometimes only in the presence of doctor (women who come to get the abortion might end up assisting them). The price of an abortion is at least\u00a02000 zl (500 euros), and it tends to go up with the standard. In some cases, when doctors are well connected, they can even perform them in hospitals, which would double the price. Many doctors who refused to perform a legal abortion are perfectly fine with doing it illegally after settling the price with their patients.\u00a0\n\nConsidering that the minimal wage in Poland is 1850 zl, and the average is 4000 (yet many people struggle to get contracts, work on 3/4 of full time, or often work on irregular gigs earning even less than 1000 z\u0142 a month with no minimal wage per hour), the price is quite prohibitive and exclusive. Many women end up taking\u00a0loans to pay off their abortions.\u00a0\n\nNowadays, women contact pro-choice organizations to find out\u00a0who can help them with abortion. Since the 90ties, press and internet advertisements were the ways to find\u00a0doctors who'd perform them. Such services would be named as \"painless restoration of menstruation\"\u00a0- and involve either chirurgical help or access to drugs, highly overpriced. In many cases a friend or a relative knows who does it in your town. The fear and paranoia remain anyhow - women are asked to leave the clinic right after the procedure is done, regardless of their condition, in order not to bring suspicion. They're asked to park their cars far away from the place of appointment.\u00a0\n\nSome of the informal groups specialize in organizing abortions abroad. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Ciocia-Basia-728670193835998/?hc_location=ufi\">Ciocia Basia</a>, a group of volunteer activist, helps to organize legal abortions in Berlin. For a price of 290/390 euros, they arrange pharmacological and chirurgical abortions in clinics, help with translations and offer a couch for the women coming over. Another popular destination is Slovakia and Czech Republic - it's super easy to find websites in Poland of clinics in these countries that provide with professional and anonymous help. Prices are similar to those in Polish underground.\n\nAnd then you have the pharmacological abortion. There are two drugs containing\u00a0misoprostol registered and available in Poland, one of which can be bought without the prescription. Women usually end up making up stories about stomach pain or rheumatic grandmothers to buy them. Sometimes both of them can be obtained from \"under the counter\", forums also advise to ask a man to help\u00a0buy them. Misoprostol should be accompanied by mifepristone to increase effectiveness (the combination of both has 98% effectiveness, while only misoprostol alone is between 80-90%), but the latter drug is not registered in Poland. In this case organizations such as <a href=\"www.womenonweb.org\">Women on Waves</a> help to buy and ship\u00a0them <a href=\"http://www.womenonwaves.org/pl/page/3404/where-can-i-buy-the-abortion-pill--ru-486--mifepristone--mifeprex--mifegyne\">from other countries</a> (they ask for donation of minimum of 70 euros, but they do support women in economic difficulties by providing them for free). It is well known that some of the doctors write prescriptions for these drugs (a pack of 12 costs 25 zl, but can be sold 10 or more times more expensive on the black market) and help women get access to them via advertisements. It's impossible to track as these drugs are not refunded by the state - therefore not registered anywhere.\u00a0\n\nDue to lack of widespread support, some of the women organize support groups on online forums. They look for other women who seek\u00a0abortions or just had one, share their stories\u00a0and explain to each other what happens to their bodies, how to access drugs, if nausea is a normal reaction to pills, etc. As in some cases, pharmacological abortion can lead to prolonged bleeding and even death, they offer each other a call of support during the abortion, which takes up to a day. It's recommended to call for an ambulance in case of emergency - doctors cannot tell if the miscarriage was illegally inducted or not, and that save\u00a0lives in some\u00a0instances of home abortions.\u00a0\n\nI am still reading some more about the abortion underground in Poland, and if I find some more interesting facts, I will updated this text. I also encourage you to share your stories on how women access abortion in countries with restrictive law.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-18 10:38:49", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 11:50:43.299541", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1049, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8203, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 3873, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>see you in the call :)</b>\n\nsee you in the call tomorrow!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-05 18:38:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.538623", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28258, "user_id": 2470, "topic_id": 6166, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Works for me. </b>\n\nWhats the weather like in Milan in October?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-04 19:36:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.815271", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2174, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2141, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## unMonastery Matera - keeping it alive, pre-opening\n\nIn order to keep the spirit of unMonastery alive in Matera and the energy moving in advance of the big opening in February - we need to create events and situate happenings at the site. @ilariadauria has made the first move towards making this happen on this <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/are-we-a-partly-italian-cultural-innovation\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>. \n\nIt's suggested that you post on the thread Ilaria's already started if you have an idea for something you'd like to do during this interim period - things that are floating in the air in this moment, a <a href=\"/t/form-storm/2127\" target=\"_blank\">Form Storm</a>, a Christmas get together and salon style sessions with individual project applications, linked with MT2019.\n\n\n## Making Sense of LOTE3\n\nWe covered a lot of ground during the unconference and we've been doing the best job we can to pull together all the documentation from the sessions - we need some help turning this into actionable tasks and continuing the good work we started.

Here's what he said: \n\nPlease, have a look at www.biourbanism.org . Would you or one of yours, publish a page with a couple of pics, to explain our readers biourbanists what your project is about? \n\nWe are prototyping (via service design) a model for reviving small Italian villages, by using local energies and potentialities, connecting them with international creatives, but mostly seeking for local solutions, roots, ideas, and initiatives - otherwise we'd risk to colonize and kill, instead of helping and unfolding (www.progettoartena.com). At the moment, we are working with 5 cities South Rome.\n\n\n## Get more involved in unMonastery\n\nFollowing the approach of LOTE3, the rhetoric still stands that if you believe in it, you can build it - carrying the energy of the space online can be a difficult feat but we welcome anyone who started building parts of unMonastery whilst at LOTE3 to continue working with us to realise the project. This can take different forms, from writing a post on the platform with your ideas, to taking on one of the existing tasks set out in the last major update on unMonastery. \n\nIf you'd like to join the team and just get stuck into building with us, this <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-roles-a-call-for-participation\">post I wrote a while ago about roles</a> is the place to head or drop us an email joinus@unmonastery.eu \n\nI've copied some of the key outstanding tasks from that post below:\n\n\n## General\n\n<strong><span>The Should:</span></strong>\n\n<span>-It would be much appreciated if someone could help with updating the website, it\u2019s built on a very straight forward CMS called Concrete5, anyone interested let me know!</span>\n\n* We really need a future planner and fundraiser, someone who\u2019s good at writing funding applications and has the time to identify opportunities and manage them.\n\n<strong><span>The Could:</span></strong>\n\n<span>-Start a meetup for unMonastery/EdgeRyders in your city.</span>\n\n* Join a team, even small amounts of time given weekly to the project are greatly appreciated and help unMonastery progress. The organisational structure of unMonastery can be seen <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/pdf/org-chart-v3.pdf\">here</a>. \n\n* Create a coded version of the popplet for the website with direct contact details to team members.\n\n<span>-Take turns writing the summary for each community call.</span>\n\n\n## Communications\n\n<strong><span>The Should:</span></strong><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n* We need a better press pack, I put it together at last minute - if you think you can make it better please do, it\u2019s currently stored on dropbox: </span><span><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nvvg5tojxn0tzkm/rQeGMhewHc\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nvvg5tojxn0tzkm/rQeGMhewHc</a>\n\n* We need a website redesign, the current one is okay but it\u2019d be better to simplify it, I\u2019m currently working on this but you can input into the process by giving feedback and ideas on this post: <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/reinvent-the-unmonastery-website\" style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">/t/unmonastery/315/reinvent-the-unmonastery-website</a>\n\n<strong>The Could:</strong>\n\n* Ola who does the graphic design work for unMonastery has offered to produce things that need to be created; for presentations, the website and general communications - if you have a clear brief (preferably with a drawing or mockup) email him <a href=\"mailto:ola@unmonastery.eu\">ola@unmonastery.eu</a> and CC me!\n\n* More people feeding into the social media accounts, if you\u2019d like to do this and are already involved in unMonastery or EdgeRyders email me for access.\n\n* There is a need for a well structured go to presentation for speaking on the unMonastery, its been on the to-do list for months, I will have this done by mid-november at the latest but any help is appreciated in advance.\n\n\n## LKW\n\nThis update is written before I've had the opportunity to fully decompress or digest everything that happened at LOTE3, but I realised it's totally crucial that we pull everything into one place and begin to galvanise what we started in Matera, if I've missed anything fundamental or you've things to add to the pot please do so in the comments thread below.", "created_at": "2013-11-10 16:17:55", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 14:26:38.896818", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1452, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 16.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29920, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4400, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Thoughts are always welcome</b>\n\nBut I'll still take a shot from the hip at it. You said: <em>\"The problem with these houses is lateral cohesion of the walls (I even saw walls split lengthwise, one half still standing \u2026)\"</em>.\n\nPerhaps this is right but I am reminded of the little anecdote where Allies were trying to figure out how to tweak their bombers to increase their survivability. Well, the ones that made it into their data-set were the ones with minor damage to the wings and tanks. So they drew the conclusion to armor the wings more. They should have armored the engines though (but those rarely survived to make it into their data-set).\n\nPerhaps the failure mode you saw (cracks running in top-to-bottom direction, if I got that right) is the benign one that you WANT to achieve more often. Because it has a chance to dissipate the energy without buckling and collapsing in a more catastrophic way?\n\nMy other thought is that probably a major factor is the orientation of the wall vs the most critical seismic movements. If the quake pushes it from the side it just falls over, if the quake pushes along the wall it translates into very large shear stresses that get dissipated through top-to-bottom cracks and perhaps partial collapse. I dunno. These things are really nasty problems I think (especially buckling of complex structures with complex load spectra). <a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA408335\">Here </a>is something that'll give you an idea - but I think you have better things to do than to read it now. One thing I'd like to get to you people would be this little <a href=\"http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/62979\">thesis </a>but I can't access it myself just now. The idea being that the advisor was heavily involved in the relief effort after the Haiti earthquake, <a href=\"http://www.haitirenaissance.org/about.html\">here</a> + <a href=\"http://video.mit.edu/watch/rebuilding-haiti-9564/\">here </a>and it is likely that if one picks up the trail via google scholar there'd be some useful material.\n\nRebar can do a lot of things [edit: found much smarter people],<s> but my direction would be to use quarry stones on the lower parts and perhaps hemp/straw reinforced dirt on the higher levels, perhaps combined with an internal bamboo cage/frame that makes sure no big lumps of the stuff can fall on people in the structure. Ideally the failure mode would be the quarry-stone base widening slightly in a controlled manner while the upper part of the wall would be progressively pulverized and \"melts\" into/over the widened base without big chunks coming down all at once. The roof would be supported on the bamboo until that would eventually tilt over and drop the load in a direction that is relatively safe. That's the dream anyway. Another aspect is how repairable the whole thing is if you accumulate minor damage over wear and tear &amp; little quakes over the decades.</s>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-17 21:58:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.681533", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29896], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5200, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 5167, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2016-01-19 21:59:26", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:49:54.000446", "deleted_at": "2017-09-19 14:51:14.280776", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26335, "user_id": 1499, "topic_id": 2332, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Great idea!</b>\n\nI mean using the MT2019 online community is important tool to communicate in the first steps.

Fail again. Fail better!\u201d Samuel Beckett</strong></em>\n\n<strong>Everyone loves success stories</strong>, but look around you: failure is everywhere. Projects fail to deliver, collaborations collapse, systems fail to improve, organisations screw up, people blunder, policies fall short.\n\nIt can happen in small ways, on a daily basis. We plan something and it goes awry. It happens at large scale too. <strong>No matter how smart or knowledgeable you are, however well you plan, it\u2019s impossible to go through life without things suddenly taking a turn for the worse at some point</strong>.\n\n<strong>It is an uncomfortable subject.</strong> Most people are reluctant to admit to failure. Social pressure tends to encourage us to pretend to be competent and unrealistically perfect. So we ignore failure, deny it, refuse to change, and things keep failing. Evidence of this dynamic can be found everyday in large systems such as: \u00a0\n\n<strong>Health and social care:</strong> Welfare is the safety net of society. Its failures are everywhere around us, but often are vested with narrative values that transcend its original socio-cultural substrate. A suicide, somebody giving up on a career to become a family care giver, a student drop out, a veteran affected by PTSD turning tramp, and so many others, are all ultimately failures of welfare. However, there is growing feeling of distrust towards this mechanism: after all also a Country\u2019s coverage of maintenance costs for a royal palace is welfare, and with moralism infecting the very root of capital culture, welfare is cloaked in the guilt of dispersing resources on people who did not try hard enough, whose \u201cpersonal resilience\u201d were not worthy of surviving the healthy natural selection of the market. Arguably, welfare failure is often a larger failure of society, of its culture of cohesion and mutuality. Should we single out specific instances of a failing system? Should we fight the cultural drift that segregates a welfare system? Or should we redesign the safety nets to meet the end goals in ways that are acceptable within the new understanding of society that is spreading?\n\n<strong>Development work:</strong> [add your input here]\n\n<strong>Financial markets:</strong> [add your input here]\n\n<strong>Cultural and creative industries:</strong> We know cultural funding via grants is dying. Yet we keep banging our heads against the same wall. This makes it much harder to build self-sufficient, sustainable projects. We need new business models, but how can they permeate our cultural habits, legal frameworks and use of technology in order to reward and be perceived fair by producers, multipliers and consumers of culture alike?\n\n<strong>Reception of Refugees and Migrants:</strong> [add your input here]\n\n<strong>...and these are just the ones we could come up with top of mind.</strong>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">So what can we do?</h2>\n\n<strong>In an ideal world, we acknowledge failure, we talk about it, we learn from it and then implement what we have learned.</strong> We get better or get different\u2026. Nassim Taleb\u2019s marvelous book \u201cBlack Swan\u201d describes unpredictable events of large magnitude and consequence. He suggests that, since you can\u2019t predict black swan events, a better approach is to build robustness against negative ones that occur and be able to exploit positive ones. This means accepting and preparing for failure as a part of doing, well, anything.\n\n<strong>Setting up a new project </strong>or business venture, challenging a large institution to take on a new approach towards policy-making, lobbying an institutional funder to rethink their strategy or getting a government to fix broken policies <strong>is setting yourself up to fail</strong>. Because the outcomes of our efforts are often unpredictable- especially if we are navigating complex adaptive systems (like the economy). If you are determined enough to keep at anything long enough, you will eventually have some successes. But how do you survive the failures on the path to getting there?\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Better together.</h2>\n\n<strong>We hereby send out a rallying cry - failures of the world, unite!</strong> \u00a0Sharing both successes and failures with others can help to limit the damage, help us learn, make us braver.\n\n<strong>There is something liberating about accepting the worst scenario as a possible outcome of any new endeavor</strong>...and then just going ahead and doing it anyway.\n\n<strong>We are not starting from scratch:</strong> Edgeryders has some experience in pioneering new ways of cat-herding large numbers of individuals to collaboratively make sense of challenging topics. Our annual community gatherings, Living On The Edge, are built by participants as knowledge engines. We meet, think, learn and have fun together while collectively building valuable relationships and knowledge...as well as setting the foundations for new collaborations and projects to emerge. Everyone is welcome to contribute what they can and every contribution is valued. Whether it is running a session, making a video or baking a cake.\n\n<strong>We hereby convene an international gathering on the theme of failures. </strong>We believe the ability to come together to fail forward in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future. The gathering is meant as a locus to exchange information and practical knowledge on how we can put the stock of underutilised knowledge from recognising and dealing with failures to a better use. We are already in deep conversation with many people and groups working in health and social care, development, cultural and creative industries as well as in finance.

It's always nice to read you on Edgeryders.\u00a0<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\nI think of anti-corruption movements in terms of evolutionary game theory (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory\">Wikipedia</a>). If corruption is widely spread, chances are it is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory#The_ESS\">evolutionarily stable strategy</a>. This is a particular mix of behaviours such that any deviation from the norm punishes the deviant. To make an extreme (and stupid) example, imagine an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory#Prisoners_dilemma\">evolutionary prisoner's dilemma</a>. You have a population consisting of individuals who all play prisoner's dilemma with other individuals around them. All individuals playing one of two variants of the famous tit-for-tat strategy:\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Variant 1</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>in the first game, <em>cooperate</em>\n</li>\n\n<li>then, \"learn from experience\": do whatever your opponent has done in the previous game.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Variant 2</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>in the first game, <em>defect</em>\n</li>\n\n<li>then, \"learn from experience\": do whatever your opponent has done in the previous game.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe evolutionary stable strategy of this game depends on two parameters: how attractive is defecting when the other player is cooperating and, critically, how many individuals use Variant 1 vs. Variant 2. If everyone starts by defecting, the system gets locked in, and everyone keeps defecting forever. This situation is an evolutionarily stable strategy: it is \"uninvadable\". If one lonely individual decides to switch to cooperating, she will be pay a high price because everyone she meets is a defector, so that there is no way she can benefit from a cooperative attitude.\u00a0\n\nHowever (for certain values of the \"attractiveness of defecting\" parameter), if you inject a sufficient number of cooperators in the population at the same time, the system will gravitate towards an evolutionarily stable strategy where most individuals cooperate most of the time. You can try it yourself: download NetLogo, call up <a href=\"http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/PDBasicEvolutionary\">this model</a> (part of the standard NetLogo model library) and play with the parameters.\n\nNow imagine that \"defectors\" are people that ask for (and pay) bribes, and \"cooperators\" are people who refuse to do so. The payoff of both corruption and integrity depends on the percentage of the population that is corrupt: the more people are corrupt, the stronger the evolutionary pressure to also become corrupt. These movements, I believe, can be seen as attempts to coordinate a critical mass of people into switching behaviour at the same time. If successful, such a switch can in principle be self-sustaining, because corruption becomes much more attractive if much fewer people are doing it. So, a person can very well have lived with corruption in a corrupt system, but be willing to forego corruption if enough people do the same.\u00a0\n\nSorry, that was long and nerdy.\u00a0<img alt=\"frown\" height=\"23\" src=\"/profiles/commons/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/confused_smile.png\" title=\"frown\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-08 17:37:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.432077", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 572, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20788], "is_liked_by": [1890], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3949, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3916, "post_number": 1, "raw": "[<em>late-night rant. you have been warned!</em>]\n\nWe need expertise. We don't need experts.\n\nI want to work out how to build our skills together, rather than turning people into blinkered 'experts' in some narrow specialism.\n\nThe existence of 'experts' represents the failure of a community to cope with some issue. You can't understand something, so you put a box around it and let one person tell you how to deal with it.\n\nAnd once that has happened, the rest of the community can stop trying. They have an excuse not to think about the issue, and the experts protect their own position with jargon and intimidation. Knowledge becomes binary -- you're either an expert or an ignoramus. The barrier between the two is hard to cross.\n\nWhat's the alternative? Look at cookery. Some of us are gourmet chefs, some can barely peel a potato. But through all that range, there is no sudden point where somebody becomes an expert. And as a consequence we can all join in, we can all work together to cook a meal. And because we can work together, knowledge can pass along the spectrum, from cordon bleu to novice.\n\nImagine if we treated accounting like cookery. Sure, @arthurd would be in charge, but the rest of us would be chopping the carrots, and stirring the soup, and watching, and learning. And soon enough, somebody else would be ready to plan a meal without Arthur.\n\nGovernment and  corporations share a flawed love of experts. Partly it's for ease of management -- assigning work to a relevant 'expert' means you don't need to break it down any further. Partly it's because they don't care about the inequity created.\n\nMostly, I think, it's because they haven't adjusted to a world of abundant education, free information, and easy communication. We have what @rmchase would call <em>excess capacity </em>in all the \"knowledge industries\". We are surrounded by skilled, talented young people. But management ignores them in favour of the person who has spent 20 years in a vaguely related field, even if that field has now changed so much that their experience is irrelevant.\n\nWe can do better. Certainly better than government, maybe better than the corporations.\n\nWe can recognize that any skill is weak when it is owned by a few experts, and strong when it is the common property of the community. When we encounter an expert, our reaction should be to pull the expertise out and share it among the community. We should turn our experts into mentors, teachers, guides. \n\nAnd in doing so, we can treat the experts as human. We can value them for the content of their character, for their engagement with the community, not for the length of their experience or the market worth of their skills. We can offer community and collaboration, interactions based on mutual respect rather than deference.\n\nHow do we get there? When I have a skill you don't, I'll teach it. When you can do something I can't, I'll listen and learn and help. And when there's a job to be done I'll stop looking for experts, and start looking to our community.", "created_at": "2014-11-18 00:13:29", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 08:37:16.816843", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 544, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 137, 4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32967, "user_id": 3045, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 43, "raw": "<b>Draft proposal for the abstract (and for the full paper) ...</b>\n\nDear @Federico Monaco and @Noemi, I read everything and here I am with my proposals.\n\nI will start with the <em>abstract</em>, that is the most urgent thing\u00a0to do, and then I will propose some considerations on the full paper, \u2026 if we will be accepted.\n\n<strong>Regarding the abstract</strong>\n\nMy impression is that the proposed one is a bit generic\u00a0 \u2026 To make it short, I make another proposal.\n\nThe first 7 lines are taken from the same OpenCare proposal (and I think they work quite well). The final part largely rephrases a paragraph of the call-for-paper.\n\nThe core of the proposal stands in the two final points + conclusions. The challenge is: will we be really capable to do it? :-)\n\nGiven that, this is my draft Abstract proposal:\n\n<strong>Infrastructuring spaces of possibilities.\u00a0</strong>Open care, from on-line conversations to on-site collaborations\n\nABSTRACT (max. 500 words)\n\n<em>The article is based on the OpenCare first results. Where OpenCare is an on-going European research delivered by a consortium of universities and the grassroots hacker community. OpneCare main goal is prototyping a community-driven model of addressing social and health care. It is based on three elements: advances in collective intelligence research, to lend coherence and summarize large-scale online debates; advances in digital fabrication and cheap-and-open hardware technology; and the rise of a global hacker community, willing and able to look for solutions to care problems. At this point of time, OpenCare I arrived at half of its journey: the prototype of care-oriented digital space is already working at the real scale; different kinds of conversations are taking place; in-depth observations on them, and on its overall functioning, can be done. </em>\n\n<em>This article moves from these conversations-in-their-environment and discusses when and how an initial trigger (such as a post presenting an idea or a story) generates an online conversation that, in turn, may evolve and become \u2013 in our case- an in-situ care-related activity. </em>\n\n<em>According to the OpenCare nature and intentions, these events are not directly generated and/or supported by the OpenCare team. Nevertheless, the way in which the digital space is organized, and the affordances that characterize it, play a role in when and how conversations start and evolve in collaborations (that, in turn, can, or cannot, move from the digital to the physical space). </em>\n\n<em>In order to do that, some experiences of \u201cdoing together\u201d (in the digital and in the physical space) are analysed and the relationships between them and the digital environment affordances are observed and discussed. In particular, the paper presents and discusses:</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>different examples of conversation, using ethnographic tools to evaluate their original culture and motivations and the way they changed moving on in their beginning towards different kinds of \u201cdoing together\u201d. </em></li>\n\n<li><em>different infrastructuring actions, done by the OpenCare team, in order to modify and up-grade the systems affordances\u00a0 </em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>The article conclusions introduce some thread of research to be developed in the next months, inside the same OpenCare, and after its conclusion. (346 words)</em>\n\n<strong>Regarding the whole article</strong>.\n\n<strong>Premise.</strong> I think it will not be easy. Looking at the bibliography RESET proposes, this call-for-paper appears emerging from a cultural background at the crossroad of technology and political sciences. For sure this is not my one. I don\u2019t know if someone of us has this specific background and therefore can guarantee that our paper will have all the references that RESET will recognize as correct and up-dated.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Examples to be considered. </strong>I think that the 6 examples proposed until now are not enough to make meaningful considerations. Therefore, what to do? I think we should change our focus and consider not only the collaborative result-oriented conversations (as the 6 proposed ones), but also other kinds of conversations, even though they have lower degree of collaboration and do not bring (directly) to care-related actions in the digital and physical world.\n\nIn other words:\n\nI think we should consider all the kinds of conversation: (1) <em>conversations for knowledge</em> (maybe in different forms) and (2) <em>conversations for action</em> (in the digital world and in the physical one).\u00a0 Given that, we should present the digital space as an environment where several conversations for knowledge can happen and evolve towards becoming conversations for action.\n\nDo you think that, in principle, it could be done? If the answer will be yes, we can go on in this line\u2026\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-24 19:15:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.896039", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 836, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25302, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5523, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nOn the hackpad.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-20 15:51:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.889826", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24733], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2013, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1980, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A quick update from Johannesburg where I am presenting Edgeryders at angelfair in a \"pitch tomorrow\" (today we did a rehearsal with feedback from \"judges)\". [irma wilson] is also here.\n\n<span>Driving Edgeryders\u00a0involves costs\u00a0and if we want to keep it independent we need to have revenue coming in to cover expenses and pay people.\u00a0</span>So, unlike most of the othr participants my primary interest is in finding clients and partners for a new kind of\u00a0open consultancy model that aims to generate revenue (there's a post somewhere with more details about this but Im\u00a0too tired to find link about this\u00a0now). My reasoning behind presenting here is that people in the room have networks where some \u00a0prospective clients \"live\" and that this could be a way to reach them without needing to know in advance who they are. So this is what I presented today (we had 3 minutes per person):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/171024903/Edgeryders-Angelfair-presentation\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Edgeryders Angelfair presentation on Scribd\">Edgeryders Angelfair presentation</a>\n\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" data-aspect-ratio=\"undefined\" data-auto-height=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600\" id=\"doc_89949\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/171024903/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\nThe reactions were really interesting. <span>The feedback session turned into a one hour discussion both with judges and the joined by some of the\u00a0people who were pitching their own initiatives.\u00a0</span>Basically some people were very provoked by 1) that I pointed out there are systemic crises existing processes are not addressing\u00a02) that I was selling consultancy and not asking for investment.\u00a0\n\nTheres a bunch of people here that are \"judges\" and \"entrepreneurship coaches\" and \"communication coaches\". When I talked to people on a one to one basis they totally got it and got excited about it.\u00a0One guy wants to start a hackerspace in south africa. I told him about unmonastery and how projects happen in Edgeryders and he got excited about it. During the feedback session he weighed in saying he had checked out the platform and the we he understood it was like\u00a0avaaz but with tools and method that gave people means to act on solving the problems collaboratively.\u00a0\n\nAnother\u00a0guy was very critical about the presentation, stating that it was basically telling all the investors who are not impact investors that we are not interested in them.\u00a0\u00a0Later during one on one conversation I\u00a0told him about the p2p support and knoweldge exchange and he went \"Hey I could use that\". Turns out he works with what he calls microenterprises, people trying to just generate revenue to support themselves and their families (and be able to afford things like schooling for their kids). He could see the value of\u00a0being able to plug into a global community of people, ideas and experiences from other parts of the world.\n\nA third person works with investor relations at Ghana Angel Investors Network and mentioned they work with Acumen fund and that she thought they should hear about what we are doing. Again the unMonastery and setting up something like it in Ghana was the main point of interest.\u00a0\n\nThe general impression was that on an individual level, people could understand the underling argument. About things not working and the need for change. But as part of a group, representatives of something other than themselves they were saying \"we don't care about this stuff, we just want to make money\". It is this gap in perspective and value systems which I find very interesting and considering the scale of challenges we are facing, scary. Maybe it was just my failure to communicate well enough, or present a compelling enough case but the\u00a0total disinterest amongst the business community to even look in the directions of big threats is worrying. The question is how to bridge that in 3 minutes, or maybe not :) More tomorrow!\n\nxxxm,\u00a0Nadia\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-25 22:56:39", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 10:24:38.282442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 767, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6658, "user_id": 2306, "topic_id": 3298, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Here's the promised story</b>\n\nOnce upon a time there was a big field situated in the middle of the capital of Germany. In its time it had seen a lot and had served many purposes. Soldiers had been marching on it and some of the first trials on flying have been proceeding there. Grand football events took place, but people also just came there for leisure.\n\nFinally it became an airport which became famous all over the world when shortly after the war \u00a0it was the hub of the airlift to provide one half of the city during the blockade by the inimical state which was surrounding it.\n\nBut in 2008, the airport was closed and seemingly nothing happened there any more.\n\nBut the now free space was to become a place for recreational activities for the citizens. So the leftovers and the waste of the airport were removed.\n\nThen, in 2010, the new park was ceremoniously opened for the public.\n\nNow joggers came and kite surfers, in winter people went cross-country skiing there, grillparties took place, children used it as playground and gardens were layed out, where people started to grow their own vegetables.\n\nAnd, even better, animals came back. Skylarks started to hatch at a quiet corner and falcons used it as a hunting area. Everything was good.\n\nBut in the background other plans were made. At the margin of the field, tenements should be erected, a huge library was planned, a new street was to be built.\n\nWhen these plans were published, the people in the neighbourhood of the field looked at each other and asked: \u201eWould we like this?\u201c\n\nMany answered this question with: \u201eNo.\u201c and became active.\n\nThey formed a commitee which petitioned for a referendum to stop all planning on the field.\n\nThough discussed controversely, because building new housing estates seemed to make sense, in the end the party of the \u201e100 % Tempelhofer Feld\u201c won the ballot. Now there is a law which makes it impossible for speculators in real estate to lay hand on the land.\n\nEverything else people were used to do there is allowed. They can jogg and kitesurf, party and play, care for their plants and just relax.\n\nThe Tempelhofer Feld remains to be a huge undisturbed piece of landscape in the middle of Germany's biggest city, thanks to group of people who took over responsibility and started counteraction.\n\nThere were photos on the original document. They vanished somehow, don't know where. But I wanted you to have this for today's online session. Can't take part.

And get people to volunteer to do take notes during the workshop. get everyone else to commit to write one post of their refelections right before they leave the workshop including one small step they would be up for taking towards realising an idea after the workshop (make sure you have enough time for them to do this).<strong>\u00a0Tell them how you are going to follow up on the results within the next 24 hours</strong>\u00a0(while the excitement is high) and where they can post and see videos, text documentation, photos...and\u00a0<strong>let them know that you DO want to stay in touch and explore further what you could do together</strong>.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">None of this is \u00a0a requirement, but it is easier to trust an initative when you see there are genuine people who want to see something good come out of it ...and are prepared to put a little skin in the game.</div>\n\n<h2><strong>Questions</strong></h2>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>What are the goals of the tour?</li>\n\n<li>How do we explain what Edgeryders is, what you can do with it, who is in here?</li>\n\n<li>Can we do an informal event for people who could not make it to join us in the evening, like a dinner?</li>\n\n<li>Do you see something like unmonastry poping up from STF workshop and how can the Ederyders community support whatever projects that could pop up from the workshops ?</li>\n\n<li>What cooperation could happen between participants from the 3 countries as the workshops don't happen at the same time?</li>\n\n<li>What opportunities are there to follow up on the ideas and wish to collaborate after the event?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">Leave comments below with any questions, or answers to the questions posed!</div>", "created_at": "2014-04-09 17:11:29", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:16.327702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2096, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27019, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1231, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Video</b>\n\nhere's the link. sorry, the embed function doesn't work.\n\n<h1 id=\"watch-headline-title\"><span>Bunker Roy: Learning from a barefoot movement </span></h1><h2>http://youtu.be/6qqqVwM6bMM</h2>", "created_at": "2012-10-04 16:02:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.476373", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 50, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7418], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17126, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3481, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Where?</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>, you'd need to find your own conference. <a href=\"/u/invisigot\">@invisigot</a>, unfortunately we don't think Matera 2019 needs much extra publicity in Italy \u2013 our focus is on the rest of Europe!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-16 16:26:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.686337", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 49, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16909], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9200, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5619, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'm in </b>\n\nlet's do it!\u00a0\n\nc\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-15 11:49:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.966466", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24375, "user_id": 64, "topic_id": 1681, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Personal vs Collective </b>\n\nOne of the main reasons that Unmonastery appeals to me is that I will be in a peaceful state of being - where I can follow what I love to do.

Ever</a>\"</em>, via <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/\">Bitcoin Magazine</a>)\u00a0\n\nOf course, I should as well mention that the author of this article, myself, has now set up an account with Changetip. In a context of Web Media, broadly, I've shared\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.changetip.com/tipworthy/KHD/pixlr-free-photo-editor-android-apps-on-google-play/\">a short review about the Autodesk <em>Pixlr</em> app, on Android</a>, via the <span>Tipworthy\u00a0</span>service at\u00a0Changetip.\u00a0In a commercial manner, perhaps Changetip could serve to provide a sort of \"Tip jar\" for reviews about apps on the Android platform. Personally, I thought that the Pixlr app might be particularly worth sharing a comment about. I think Pixlr is simply a useful photo editor app.\n\nNot as if to simply promote my own content, though: As Changetip being a service providing \"Tip jars\" in a various number of currencies, including Bitcoin, I believe Changetip can serve to provide something of a <em>material </em>side to web content development, online - whether with or without a conventional commercial or otherwise institutional \"Silo\".\n\nOf course, it may not serve to provide a great amount of \"Profit incentive\" for content development, if to develop content only for an exchange of arbitrary \"Change\", if there would not seem to be any apparent goodwill of the endeavor. Perhaps it takes a certain sense of imagination, to believe there may be a broader sense of goodwill about it.\n\nI'm certain that -- as with the Silk Road incidents -- it could be ostensibly exploited, but I do not believe as if that would be in alignment with what it has been developed about, any of Tipworthy, Changetip, Bitcoin, or other services and concepts developed in regards to material cryptocurrencies.\u00a0\n\nNot as it to propose any sort of an exceptionally <em>radical </em>idea, I wonder if -- more broadly -- if Bitcoin could be of any particular material relevance, if not furthermore any manner of philosophical relevance, in this context?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-19 16:36:59", "updated_at": "2017-09-25 12:45:22.859988", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 733, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 16.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9454, "user_id": 51, "topic_id": 1627, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>so great to see so many people in the gallery</b>\n\nawesome\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-18 20:49:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:54.471233", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19886, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 519, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Interested!</b>\n\nI am more a engineer/scientist on the dead matter side of things - but I know just enough to understand that this is a pretty big thing.\n\nIf you do skype with @WinniePoncelet I'd love to be a fly on the wall and see if I can contribute in some way.\n\nDo you know the question function of research gate?

I am between the many worlds without belonging solely to any one or other of them The benefit of this is that I can hear the harmonics between different communities, methodologies and paradigms. I was born to Irish parents in the heart of the Irish midlands, was 'educated' locally before leaving to the city of Galway to finish school and begin university. I took a BA in philosophy and english literature while learning bits and pieces of circus skills, druidic lore and eastern philosophy. In between studies I took time to travel around Europe and start a small circus company in Ireland. I was a very unconscious youth dealing for some time with the after effects of a chaotic upbringing.\n\nHaving graduated from university I left for circus school in the Netherlands. 8 months in I fell ill and spent the majority of the next three years between hospital and the sickbed. This experience was more educative than anything I have ever experienced in my life. I understood through these experiences a lot about a huge variety of things, the nature of life and death, the many flaws of the western health system, truths about time and perception, the many aspects of our being and how (like the EU;) they interrelate and interweave creating all of our perceived successes and failures. It became clear that treating one aspect in isolation would be a futile excercise and so after too long in hospital I decided to give up the surgery and medication and head for the East. I moved to India to find a doctor I had been told about in a town called Pushkar. I found him and after two months he had me fit and happy again and I found a determination to help people.\n\nAfter travelling India for some months I came back to Europe and after a brief period in Ireland I moved to Berlin, a Yogi I had met had told me many things about my life he had no way of knowing other than some kind of clairvoyance, he also told me that I would be thinking of a move when I returned home and he urged me to make this move, \"it will be good for you\" he said. Berlin has a youthful energy that moves and shakes according to the interactions of its people, compared with the stagnation I felt in Ireland, Berlin was the place to be. In Berlin I learned to use twitter and began following people who seemed to share in the world view I found in myself, I was amazed, here was a whole community of people conversing and sharing the many thoughts and feelings I had in isolation over the past years. I always had an inkling that ideas were impersonal and that creativity was based on exergy and the arrangement of present-state conditions. Now, reading all of these mirror-images to what I had thought were 'my' thoughts I knew that impersonality to be true.\n\nWe are EdgeRyders because we are situated on the crest of the wave of the present, we let go easily because we realize the cost of attachment, and we have faith in our position and its power to steer us out of precarious situations. Whether we consciously know it or not, the universe tends toward dissipation which is increased, as is complexity, in the evolution of order. The will we share we can often confuse as being our own, but it is a collective will born in a collective unconscious and our ability to stay connected to that rests in our faithfulness to this edge. If we want a new world to come of the crumbling of the old then we are going to have to build it from the bottom up. All the cultural and supra-cultural communities of the world passing the bricks of their experience and action to form one home to house them all.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-24 00:19:43", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:22:52.488195", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 691, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 50.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19208, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4546, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>SCIM modifications</b>\n\nI recently sent @LucasG some comments with regard to this.

Another one is coming up, but it's slow progress, as we can't (and wouldn't want to) force people into addressing their conflicts through RC. One of our issues is that there is already quite a bit of stored up ill feeling -- resentment even -- between some groups of people with conflicting views or needs. Hopefully RC should lead to rebuilding trust, but that cannot be more than a hope at this stage. I have also personally been involved in informal mediation between different parties in drawing up a food policy for our shared spaces that respects both vegans (some of whom are highly sensitive to the presence of meat and fish in their eating space) and others who feel they need non-vegetarian food for their health and well-being.

She has the looks of a friendly grandmother but the vivacity and energy of a young activist that believes in the power of humans. She played an active role in the recent car free shift of the centre of Brussels but made sure it didn\u2019t become a gentrified zone. She majored in philosophy and made the choice to work all her live half time so she could invest her time in local or global movements.\n\nFirst when I asked her to give a short opinion about the bottom up imitatives organizing care related projects she responded: I only believe people can give care when it comes from love and friendship. All other forms need to be done by the government to be effective. I was really surprised by this ballsy argument so I invited over for a drink on the hottest day of the year (35\u00b0C!) and we had a tomato juice and a great conversation.\n\nWe dived immediately into the subject. Care is a government issue for\u00a0 her that isn\u2019t at all taken care (pun intended) of. Why does the government give as much power to the pharmaceutical industry for example? Why can Nestl\u00e9 become the number one partner of a government organization called \u2018Kind En Gezin\u2019 that helps parents of new-born through the first year? For her our role as activist and change makers is to put pressure on the government to make change on a big scale possible.\n\nI explain her how local initiatives are bending the system like <a href=\"/t/open-insulin/490\">the open insulin</a>, <a href=\"/t/the-cytostatics-network-seen-through-the-eyes-of-a-member/484\">chemotherapy in Romania</a> or ways that people are <a href=\"/t/doctor-could-you-hack-me-a-neuroprosthesis-please/483\">hacking neuroprosthetis</a>. Even if she find them great initiative she is scared that it will not be scalable, for her if the government doesn\u2019t follow, nothing will change on the long term. I ask her why even within this idea people are rather trying to find solutions themselves then going in the street and pressuring the government. It makes sense, she says, you have an illusion doing something more meaningful while starting a project, then putting pressure on a government where the reward will (maybe) be given after many years. Instant gratification is much more popular, and with bureaucratic complexification people are less temped to get into a long battle with the government.\n\nBut Ginette isn\u2019t the person to only be sceptic and give critic towards ideas. She likes finding solutions. So before I explain her the principle of the workshop we talk a bit further on the big problems ahead. For her everything can be put into three categories: poverty, elderly care and work ethics. Poverty makes it impossible to take care of each other; it is a vicious circle that is difficult to get out of. Even with the best projects, people without money will not get towards it. Elderly care is also a big problem in European countries, care became profit and it is all about efficiency. Only a rearrangement about how we look at elderly care can get us out of this problem. Finally there is the way we look at work and how it makes us sick: burn out is one of the biggest epidemics of this century and involves pulls the whole family downwards. Not one political party is discussing these problems on a larger scale and that is problematic for her. The resources are there, but the unwillingness of changing is bigger. Politicians aren\u2019t trained to be vectors of change; they are the ones that bring continuity. It\u2019s the civilians that need to push the change and politics to implement it.\n\nDark times ahead? Maybe, but this discussion made me think more clearly about the workshop and what we need to take notice of when bringing care-project together. Like within the makers movement it is important to find a balance between corporate and counter culture partners, within care it is also important to have an open approach towards policy makers. Yes we are in a ruff path at the moment, and trust is at an all time low towards politicians. But therefor it is the moment to open our arms to welcome them towards new ways of organizing care. We need much more and easier collaboration between projects. We need especially that knowledge of the government to tackle complex problems with multiple partners. We need to take them by the hand and show them what there is possible within an open care system\n\nThe discussion I want to open towards the community is: Is involving the policy makers important, or will it be obsolete in the future? What kind of dialogue can care taking projects take towards it?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-26 13:32:05", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 07:47:43.021822", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 862, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 30.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13870, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3597, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>More ideas for applying math and Python skills :)</b>\n\nWelcome to the edge, Linda :) Glad to see that our slightly chaotic online space did not deter you \u2026 hope you'll find an interesting and meaningful activity for you around here!\n\nYour account of wanting to make a difference reminds me of <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/marcin-jakubowski/\">Marcin Jakubowski</a>, also a physicist. He was working on nuclear fusion, missed making a real-world difference with that, and came to the conclusion that \"nuclear fusion <em>is</em> useful \u2026 150 million kilometers from earth\" :D Then went on to build <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/\">Open Source Ecology</a>.\n\nMath plus programming is super useful of course :) Here are two immediate use cases from an Edgeryders project that I'm involved in. It's called the <a href=\"/en/makerfox\">Makerfox project</a>, and it is a <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/\">web platform</a>. Started last year as a somehow Edgeryders-affiliated project that a small team including me is working on. In short, we're developing a better working economic exchange mechanism than money (more precisely, money in austerity-plagued Europe).\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>For Makerfox, we invented this thing we call \"network bartering\", which is very flexible bartering in graph shapes (see an example below: every participant gets as much as they give). To calculate the next valid barter deal, we use mixed integer linear programming as a mathematical optimization technique. For now this works ok (using a standard MILP solver library), but with more users, our algorithm has to be more efficient. I keep hearing that application specific MILP algorithms are often two orders of magnitude faster \u2026 so, you get the idea. Might be a bit much to fit in before a thesis though.</li>\n\n<li>Also, we so far have only very basic ideas about the economic performance of a network barter market \u2026 we could use some agent based simulation and statistical evaluation. A teammate who will work on this is a Python programmer as well, so this would be a good opportunity for Python skills.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAnyway, these are just inspirations. Have a look around, there are many more projects, and I'm curious what will be your favorite in the end.\n\nAnd Alberto, sorry for these \"competing\" proposals, but I could not resist. Math-savvy folks are just too few around!\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5f2bd76a9f216e73f9ee8a6650b8ea0dd8df040a.png\" width=\"189\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-10 18:24:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.394346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 437, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8433], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26620, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5729, "post_number": 26, "raw": "Great, and as I just got fired from my other work, I have time to help much more.

He repeated a dozen times that empowerment for business employees \"generates quick decisions, saves time, reduces costs and boosts administration sales.\"\n\nWhile John Tschohl had no time to go into details in this one hour radio show about how empowerment works, and even more complicated to explain, where does empowerment come from, as it navigates in subtle and complex mechanisms of the mind and of collective consciousness, to make a long story short, he described empowerment as being 'skills and attitude'. Both a behavior that is adopted, and abilities that are acquired with experience. Therefore, one must change behavior and ensure that it becomes a \"lifestyle\", he said.\n\nI love this description of Baird T. Spalding, of empowerment that leads to radiance of the personality: \"<span>The body harmonizes itself, the soul radiates, illuminates the mind, ideas become pervasive, brilliant, vibrant, and accurate.

I started reading. Swimming in this ocean of content, ideas, visions, projects, debates - and tried to add a coin to it. It worked. I got to Stockholm and for two days participated in one of the most advanced, socially responsible talks ever - done in a small group of people, mostly doing very informal, very off-the-path things. I liked it.\n\nI'm a political scientist and journalist with a university paper stating that. I am a journalist, freelancing mostly about culture (music, movies, literature) and architecture in the political and social context. This is what I wanted to do for my PhD. The Uni turned out to be too much of a burden for me - random classes to be taught, questions what architecture has to do with politics were just tiring. During my studies I started moving a bit - studies in Iceland opened my cognitive perspectives and fed me with ideas about civil society and cities as political and social phenomena. Then I came back to Lublin, where I used to study and live, and got into the leftist scene: working for a squat, helping out the most interesting NGO, doing cultural jobs, finally writing a lot of things. Academia was giving us time to do many things. And we did it.\n\nI lived in quite some cities, taking various jobs, always seeking for sense and social benefit in them. I always wanted to contribute to something meaningful. I always believed that even the small things I organised, helped with, made myself - would have a value. Money is secondary. Energy is the asset that requires being directed in the right place. Otherwise, you waste your precious time.\n\nAfter having to do with ngos who almost destroyed my faith in their mission, I had to jump back in the Edgeryders community and rethink everything. It's a challenge. It's different. And I do believe in it. Och, I so do.\n\nI will be doing the communication and media-related work for Edgeryders. I will be asking you for the\u00a0<a href=\"/t/countonme-july-headlines/3347\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">headlines\u00a0</a>and sending them every morning.

And hopefully much more and for a long time.

I studied BSc Environment, Economics and Ecology at York University and spent a lot of time there exploring the surrounding countryside by mountain bike, participating in races and mountain bike groups. I started a design business designing and printing\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.andrewwelch.info/t-shirt-shop/\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-size: 14.3999996185303px; line-height: 19.0399990081787px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">t-shirts</a>\u00a0which promoted sustainable and progressive living.

I am studying heritage and the loss of the heritage structures were hard for me to bear. It doesn't mean that I care less about human cost. I do. The loss of human life coupled with the loss of our heritage was too much for me.\n\nSo when I photographed the destruction I tried to portray what people lost during the quake. They lost a part of their identity, their cultural sense and for some of them, their livelihood. I tried to photograph that. And, also how the community and the local people mobilized in no time to save people who were buried in the detritus and saving the gods they've prayed too all their lives. Sometimes us commoners have to rescue the gods, it seems. I tried to photograph that. And the bonding, and a sense of urgency that was displayed during those chaotic times.\n\nAll these make up for a tricky photography subjects. You cannot just go there and photograph and then leave without helping. So, I did my part. Stood guard in the Mangal Bazaar few hours about the first quake. And, then went there regularly to help clearing the debris, helping to make an inventory of the stuffs we recovered from the loss. The DOA and KVPT will probably use those images when they will start reconstructing the sites there. Still volunteering for them when time permits.\"\n\nYou can follow him on twitter: @mt_ris\u00a0\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>SHASHANK SHRESTHA</span></strong>\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say don\u2019t let taking a good photo get in the way of being a good human. Help out... a picture is not worth being a douche bag. Apart from that, I\u2019d love to see more images of hope now onwards. Also, try to capture all sides of the story. The basics approach: Wide shot - medium shot - close up.\n\nAlso, do not stage anything. Capture as is. People have a lot of stories to share now\u2026 try to be a bit curious about their story than just taking their portrait.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f11d05442be50d28e351602b71181dba2505fa6e.jpg\" width=\"674\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Would you take a photo of dead bodies being lifted, or you know people crying?</strong>\n\n\u201cDead bodies no... not unless I have a good reason.\u00a0 People crying... yes.\u201d\n\n<strong>Why?</strong>\n\n\u201cBecause it is a powerful image and it can lead the viewer to action. But before all you need to respect their privacy... if they don\u2019t want you around don\u2019t insist on it.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Shashank on his Instagram <a href=\"https://instagram.com/shashankji/\">HERE</a>.\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>MANISH MALLA</span></strong>\n\n\u201cI think I cannot exactly point out an appropriate way of photographing the devastation that ensued after the earthquake. I have not captured devastation scenario but was in various places for relief work. At the most, I tried capturing resilience sprit of the people, struck by devastation.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f8f979bb9c53e6f05d3494e762fb616fe591ecd1.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n\u201cDuring such vulnerable situation (especially when people are traumatized) it was hard to take photographs. I always made sure that I was not invading their personal space during my visits to different camps (temporary shelters). Whenever and wherever I was taking photographs of people I had short conversation with them to know their story and experience during devastation. Asking for their permission was what I always did.\u201d\n\nYou can find more of his photographs album-ed Resilience Amidst Devastation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ManishBaucha/media_set?set=a.10153277761107451.1073741861.531197450&amp;type=1&amp;__mref=message\">HERE</a>.\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>ALISHA ADHIKARI</span></strong>\n\n\"The photos I found the most compelling after the earthquake were the ones that showed people going about their day doing things\u00a0 inspite of and also because of the earthquake.\u00a0 I particularly remember two photos: one was of a woman praying to a statue amongst the ruins in Bhaktapur and the other one was of two little kids playing with their plates while lining up for food being handed out. I think these photos stuck because ultimately they both captured the small moments that occurred even when it seemed like so much was lost.\u00a0 They made me realise there was a lot left too.\n\nI realise that there are equally valid reasons for photos that show dead bodies, blood and panick but I found them hard to look at. But maybe that's the point.\u00a0With relief work, photography related or otherwise,\u00a0 I think it should ultimately be about the people you're helping and not about you helping them.\"\n\nYou can follow her on Tumblr <a href=\"http://elsawanders.tumblr.com/\">HERE</a>.\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>SANJANA SHRESTHA</span></strong>\n\n\u201cI think the idea is to focus on what remains, and what can be built back. What remains is dignity and it\u2019s important to show that. As for photographing children, explaining to children and their families why he/she is being photographed and how it is going to be used is extremely important.\u201d\n\n<strong>What about photos where people are crying, standing in front of the rubbles?</strong>\n\n\u201cInitially those photos might make for great content but for me, my litmus test is to put myself in their shoes. Those kind of photos might work for showing the circumstances but as a photographer who works for a humanitarian organization, I always put myself in that persons' shoes. It's my litmus. What if it was me in that picture. Personally, having worked in humanitarian situations before, I am amazed at the ability for people to bounce back. that's where I focus.\n\nI end up not submitting a lots of photos I take because I put myself in their shoes when I am processing those photos.\u201d\n\n<strong>You may have seen a lot of relief related photos in social media, what is your take on this?</strong>\n\n\u201cLike everything in social media, it\u2019s a bane and a blessing. Just like the traffic lights, it\u2019s your choice whether you want to follow the rules or not.\u201d\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>ROCKY PRAJAPATI</span></strong>\n\n\u201cMy opinion about photographing the devastation would be - we should of course do photography about the recent devastation. This should not just be for your portfolio but to ensure a record as history for the future. Meanwhile, we should also have to be capable of showing its beautiful parts that has survived. We also should let the world know that Nepal is not all gone and the best effort that people did during the rescue and the fast relief management. Again, we should also know the ethics of photographing the sensitivity of the situation and the state of people's own respect and dignity. What I found during all these weeks few people don't even know of doing journalism in such a sensitive issue. People should learn and study photojournalism before they decide they are photojournalist or photographer.\u201d\n\n<strong>But what about those saying \"we are doing this for documentation\" or to those who ask for photographic evidence for fund raising intentions?</strong>\n\n\u201cTrue we need documentation for fund raising, I'm not saying we should not take any picture but my concern is how you want it to be presented. I just request people to be responsible and sensitive to spread their message.\u201d\n\n<strong>I saw your rescue video \u2013 what was it like shooting it.</strong>\n\n\u201cThe footage was incomplete because I couldn't shoot it complete for me at that moment her life was much worthy than the footage so I help others to dig her out.\"\n\n<strong>Do you remember what you felt the instant you put down your camera and went to help?</strong>\n\nI thought of continuing to shoot with one hand but the next aftershock made people ran away. And one of a guy had guts to be there that pull me to help him dig her out.\"\n\nYou can find the rescue video that his team shot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-volunteers-rescue-elderly-woman-rubble-bahktapur-video?CMP=share_btn_fb\">HERE </a>(They donated the money that they got to relief effort.)\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>KSHITIZ MATRAI</span></strong>\n\n\u201cThis time around, I felt like I was one of them \u2013 \u201cthe victims\u201d. For a while I was not sure if I would have a place for myself. It is not that I haven\u2019t taken photos of emotional situations but this was different.

The earthquake is a historic thing, it is obvious that people would want to keep a record of it. But you'd have to be very sensitive about it. Try and be discreet and not shove cameras into the face of the people. While photographing relief perhaps try not to stall or obstruct the work or get in the way. And keep shots to a minimum.\u201d\n\n<span>-----*-----*-----</span>\n\n<strong><span>EVA PIVAC</span></strong>\n\n\u201cHmm, not an easy question. I think there is no right or wrong, in my opinion one should take pictures of things/people that emotionally affect him/her. For me personally, I like finding beauty in ordinary things. In the eyes and smiles of the people, in colours that are still there, even though there are cracks... Difficult to explain...\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7a65a8dc33ad2389df8509ba05b0b00ccd073b39.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Was it particularly difficult or easy for you as a foreigner to take photographs at this time?</strong>\n\n\u201cSometimes it was difficult, because it was very emotionally demanding. For example, when I visited Swayambu, I couldn't even take pictures. But, when I saw something positive or beautiful despite the devastation surrounding it, it was very rewarding. I had to take those!

Photographing is a very subjective experience - but the code of ethics is something that you have to draw the line on your own and be ready to face the consequences. You can decide whether you want your photograph to make a difference or perpetuate dependency, voyeurism, and victimization.

They helped me amend the map that I will share very soon as a basis for further work.\n\nYour reply here, on merging conflicting worldviews in one, touches a very difficult question. How to incorporate a worldview into one more encompassing... In short you are asking how to bring someone from one level of consciousness to another level of consciousness... It's a question I have been mulling on for more than a year. And I'm sure i'm not the only one!\n\nWhat I have come to sense is that people have some reluctance to accept 'transcendence' that is not originated in or from their own worldviews or by osmosis resulting of contact with others in inter-subjective exchanges. So you would need first to express the more encompassing view in the form of narrative of the old view, so the new view can be understood and adopted almost 'naturally'. That's where language comes into the picture and the whole discourse on the edge actually... Edge is on the side, and eventually permeates the mainstream.\n\nThe reason why I believe so strongly on the potential of the commons as a converging concept is that if we manage to express the whole territory of the commons in ways where people can navigate from their position in relation to the commons to other conceptions of the commons by \"adjacencies\" and follow theads from embodiments of the commons the closest to their worldviews and progressively more remote, then this will evolve in the direction of a convergence and a more encompassing worldview. This is something that is observed in intercultural relationships. People who happen to decode other cultures by direct practical contact tend to adopt more encompassing views and increase their horizons through increasingly easier connections with new cultures. I also observed this on social groups on the edge. We rub our antennaes to learn from each other and something passes from one to another that expands our horizon of understanding and our consciousness.\n\nAnd actually, this is quite incredible, because I just made a pause here and browsed through Michel Philipi's report to bring this in the comment, and what I have described above is exactly what he expresses there! Talk of convergence!\n\n\"Nous serons civilis\u00e9s si nous pouvons concevoir diff\u00e9rents Hommes et les articuler entre eux pour d\u00e9crire au mieux l\u2019humanit\u00e9. Alors chaque humain pourra choisir d\u2019\u00eatre l\u2019un de ces Hommes, ou plusieurs en cherchant comment les articuler en lui. Et chaque Homme incarn\u00e9 pourra s\u2019articuler dans l\u2019espace social \u00e0 d\u2019autres Hommes incarn\u00e9s. Nous construirons alors une civilisation pouvant faire vivre de mani\u00e8re incarn\u00e9e toutes les connaissances que nous avons sur l\u2019humain et celles \u00e0 venir, et probablement toutes les connaissances que nous avons sur le R\u00e9el et celles \u00e0 venir. Tout cela sans que les humains s\u2019opposent les uns aux autres en se d\u00e9truisant, en d\u00e9truisant leurs connaissances et leurs productions au nom de la supr\u00e9matie d\u2019un Homme.\"\n\nSo what I am suggesting Lyne, is that we articulate the different embodyments of the commons on the field of action so that we can in an impressionist way make the whole idea of the commons visible to all. I repaste here what I have written on the call for caring for the commons post about a mapping to be done on the commons that would:\n\n<div>1. Help people recognize which spot or niche they occupy within the commons action space so they can assert their position and adjust their action in relation to an overarching generative commons discourse.</div><div>2. Help the various niches find their areas of overlaps and adjacencies so that bridges can be built and exchanges occur, strengthening the meshing of what emerges into a network of initiatives and achievements that would multiply everyone's impact and accelerate a convergence.</div><div>3. Provide some visibility on the 'whole' (or at least an impressionist picture of it) so that policy makers and other interested parties can build some political action.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A practical application of your Luminous man? Is Michel coming to strasbourg? Could Michel's game applied to the commons be used during or as a preparation for the conference?

Time and again, we find it the most powerful force that people with next to no wealth and no power, like us, can evoke. We are getting good at it, though much work remains. Proof: we are a mutant company with no office, no investors, no business plan. We have nothing but each other \u2013 a tiny core of founders, and the Edgeryders community. And yet we are out there, with top-notch global organizations among our clients, and we are growing. 2016 has been a good year for us \u2013 we'll be blogging about this soon.\n\n2016 has also been a year of uncertainty and discontent in world politics. Many people dear to us are sad, angry or scared. Almost no one seems satisfied about their politics and their leaders. That goes both for the losing camp and the winning one. We consider this contrast, and wonder. As a culture, we are getting better at working together in diversity. Why does this not translate into more constructive politics? \n\nAs we looked into this, we realized that our default frame for politics is combat. There are opponents and allies. Its protagonists focus on winning. This is understandable but useless, except maybe as a spectator sport. What happens if we drop this frame and adopt a collaboration frame instead? What would happen if a political entity were run like a collaborative project? What would happen if lawmaking worked like Wikipedia? What if policy happened like the next release of Apache or Ubuntu?\n\nThis:\n\n* [b]Enabling as core mission[/b]. A state, or city, or region, exists <em>only</em> to enable the people who live there to do what they want to do. It does not need a vision, because people have their own. It only needs to enable the largest possible outcome space for the largest number of people. In return, it gets compliance and tax revenue. This would be the only focus of collaborative politics. Compare with political visionaries, who try to sell you their way of seeing things.\n\n* [b]By default, do nothing[/b]. When faced with a proposal for radical reform, the community around a collaborative project discusses it. These discussions can last a long time. Then, almost always, the radical reform does not go ahead. This is because, whatever its other flaws, the project in its current form works. Its next version might be much improved, but no one can guarantee that it will work, and when. Reform needs a rock-solid case to go forward. Compare with I-need-to-leave-a-mark-on-my-term.\n\n* [b]Focus on infrastructure[/b]. Collaborative software projects do not make things, but building blocks that people can build things with. Enabling, remember? The point is not to decide which color is best for people's web pages, but to write code that allows anyone to easily choose any color for their own page. In the policy world, this means building infrastructure\u2013 and infrastructure is hierarchical. The more general, the better. Aqueducts are better than hospitals. Hospitals are better than arts centers. Arts centers are better than exhibitions. Compare with bullshit pet projects of elected representatives (\"Let's make an incubator for social innovation\").\n\n* [b]Unglamorous leaders[/b]. Narcissistic, flamboyant personalities do not do well in collaborative projects. People's attention needs to be on building, so attention seekers are a liability. The most respected members of these community are nerdy, reliable people that won't waste your time. Compare with modern politicians near you.\n\n* [b]Avoid controversy[/b]. Any successful open source project has lots of controversial proposals for moving forward. But it also has many on which everyone agrees. Controversy is a waste of time, so people go for the low-hanging fruit first, and build the things everyone agrees on first. This builds mutual trust, and might take the project in directions that make the controversy disappear altogether. Compare with politics-as-combat.\n\n* [b]Do-ocracy, not stakeholder representation and deliberation[/b]. Stakeholder representation has served us well when societies were simple and hierarchical. In those salad days, a dozen people around a table could make decisions, and know they would be executed. This no longer possible. In a collaborative project we don't discuss what to do. Within the (broad) core values of the project, you can do whatever you want as long as you have the capacity to deliver it. Who does the work calls the shots. No one gets to tell others how they should contribute.  Compare with endless debates and cross-vetoes everywhere.\n\nYou get the idea. This how we work when we build online encyclopedias and web server software. Or companies like Edgeryders. Could this be how we work when we build our cities, national parks and energy grids? Could we do that not in the name of an ideology, but simply to build our own happiness, and that of those we love? \n\nCould there be another space to get down to building? A terrain so hyperlocal and fragmented as to be too expensive for narcissistic strongmen and Machiavellian schemers to enter? A move so lateral that it will not even exist in the same space as post-truth politics? \n\nWe don't know, yet. But, in the wake of the dark tide of 2016, we see people in our network asking new questions. Something new, something big is on the move. As always, we will stand by our community, and help as best we can. If you, too, have been waiting for something to get in motion; if you want to be a part of building it, and figuring out where it takes, get in touch.\n\nYesterday (November 22) we presented an actionable plan for how we can get started on making this happen. Right now, without waiting for anyone. While boosting our individual economic and psychosocial resilience. \n\nIt's a first stab at articulating something we have been working towards for some years now. \n\n[Here it is](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dLSsQ_eB3VfLAY3XAu6SnT1RITG_hx6V3dN2SNwY0s0/edit?usp=sharing), what do you think?\n\nThis a BIG puzzle. You hold important pieces, whether or not you know it.\n\n[b]So please do share your reflections. In comments on slides, below or in an email: nadiaelimam@protonmail.com[/b]\n\n[s]I'll be revealing some of our immediate plans  at AdaWeek in Paris, on November 22nd ([info](https://adaweek2016.sched.org/)): if you can't make it there, get in touch with me or [join our mailing list](http://bit.ly/2gsvuzz).[/s] \n\n<em>[written with Alberto Cottica.

Progetto dopo progetto, troviamo che \u00e8 la forza pi\u00f9 potente che le persone con poche ricchezze e nessun potere, come noi, possa mettere in campo. Stiamo diventando bravi a collaborare. La prova: siamo un'azienda mutante senza una sede, senza investitori e senza business plan. Non abbiamo niente se non noi stessi \u2013 un minuscolo nucleo di fondatori, e la comunit\u00e0 di Edgeryders. Eppure siamo in campo. Alcune organizzazioni leader nel mondo sono nostri clienti. Cresciamo. Il 2016 \u00e8 stato un buon anno per noi \u2013 ne scriveremo presto.\n\nIl 2016 \u00e8 stato anche un anno di incertezza e malcontento nella politica mondiale. Molte persone che abbiamo care sono tristi, arrabbiate o impaurite. Quasi nessuno sembra soddisfatto della politica e dei suoi leaders. Questo \u00e8 vero sia nel campo dei perdenti che in quello dei vincitori. Questo contrasto ci meraviglia. La nostra cultura sta imparando a lavorare sempre meglio insieme nella diversit\u00e0. Perch\u00e9 questo non si traduce in una politica pi\u00f9 costruttiva?\n\nRiflettendo su queste cose, ci siamo accorti che tendiamo a inquadrare la politica come combattimento. Ci sono attacchi, alleati, nemici. I suoi protagonisti si concentrano sul vincere. Questo \u00e8 comprensibile ma inutile, eccetto forse in quanto intrattenimento. Cosa succede se abbandoniamo questo punto di vista e ne adottiamo uno collaborativo? Cosa succederebbe se un'entit\u00e0 politica fosse gestita come un progetto collaborativo? Se la produzione di leggi funzionasse come Wikipedia? Se le politiche pubbliche fossero implementate come una versione di Apache o Ubuntu?\n\nQuesto:\n\n* [b]Abilitare \u00e8 la missione chiave.[/b] Uno stato, una citt\u00e0, una regione, esistono solo per abilitare le persone che ci vivono a fare quello che vogliono fare. Non hanno bisogno di avere una visione, perch\u00e9 le persone ne hanno gi\u00e0 una loro.  Deve solo allargare al massimo lo spazio del possibile, per il numero pi\u00f9 alto possibile di persone. In cambio, ottiene compliance e gettito fiscale. Questo sarebbe l'unico obiettivo della politica collaborativa. Confronta con i visionari politici, che cercano di venderti il loro modo di vedere le cose.\n\n* [b]Nel dubbio, non fare niente.[/b] Quando viene proposto un cambiamento importante, la comunit\u00e0 intorno a un progetto collaborativo lo discute. Queste discussioni possono essere lunghe. Poi, quasi sempre, il cambiamento non va avanti. Questo \u00e8 perch\u00e9, quali che siano i suoi difetti, il progetto nella sua forma attuale funziona. La sua prossima versione potrebbe migliorare molto, ma nessuno pu\u00f2 garantire che funzionerebbe, o quanto ci vorrebbe per metterla a terra. Il cambiamento radicale richiede argomenti molto forti per andare avanti. Confronta con \"devo fare qualcosa per lasciare un segno del mio mandato\"\n\n* [b]Concentrarsi sulle infrastrutture.[/b] I progetti collaborativi per il software non fanno programmi, ma componenti con cui le persone possono fare programmi. Il punto non \u00e8 di decidere qual \u00e8 il colore migliore per le pagine web, ma di scrivere codice che permette a tutti di scegliere facilmente qualunque colore per le loro pagine. Nel mondo delle politiche pubbliche, questo significa costruire infrastruttura, e l'infrastruttura \u00e8 gerarchica. Pi\u00f9 \u00e8 generale, meglio \u00e8. Gli acquedotti sono meglio degli ospedali. Gli ospedali sono meglio dei centri culturali. I centri culturali sono meglio delle mostre. Confronta con i tanti progetti inutili degli amministratori (\"Facciamo un incubatore per l'innovazione sociale fondata su blockchain\").\n\n* [b]Leaders NON carismatici.[/b] Le personalit\u00e0 narcisiste e appariscenti non funzionano bene nei progetti collaborativi. L'attenzione delle persone deve essere sul costruire, quindi chi cerca attenzione \u00e8 un peso morto per gli altri. Le persone pi\u00f9 in vista di queste comunit\u00e0 sono persone affidabili e spesso un po' nerd, che non ti fanno perdere tempo. Confronta con un leader politico a scelta.\n\n* [b]Evita la controversia.[/b] Tutti i progetti open source di successo hanno molte proposte controverse per andare avanti. Ma ne hanno anche molte su cui tutti sono d'accordo. Le controversie fanno perdere tempo, quindi le persone realizzano per prime le proposte condivise. Questo crea fiducia reciproca, e potrebbe fare evolvere il progetto in una direzione in cui la controversia sparisce completamente. Confronta con la politica-come-combattimento.\n\n* [b]Do-ocracy, non rappresentazione degli interessi e deliberazione.[/b] La rappresentazione degli interessi (stakeholder representation) ci ha servito bene quando le societ\u00e0 erano semplici e gerarchiche. A quei tempi, una decina di persone intorno a un tavolo potevano prendere una decisione, sapendo che sarebbe stata eseguita. Questo non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 possibile. In un progetto collaborativo non si discute sul cosa fare. Nell'ambito dei valori di riferimento, puoi fare quello che vuoi purch\u00e9 ne abbia la capacit\u00e0. Chi fa il lavoro decide cosa fare e come farlo. Nessuno pu\u00f2 dire a nessun altro come contribuire. Confronta con interminabili dibattiti e veti incrociati.\n\nQuando scriviamo enciclopedie online o software per web servers lavoriamo cos\u00ec. Stessa cosa quando facciamo imprese come Edgeryders. Potremmo lavorare cos\u00ec anche quando costruiamo le citt\u00e0, i parchi nazionali, le griglie elettriche? Potremmo farlo non nel nome di un'ideologia, ma semplicemente per costruire la nostra stessa felicit\u00e0 e abbondanza, e quella di coloro che amiamo?\n\nPotrebbe esserci un altro spazio dove costruire? Un terreno cos\u00ec iperlocale e frammentato da divenire troppo costoso per uomini forti narcisisti e consiglieri machiavellici? Una mossa cos\u00ec laterale da non esistere nemmeno nello stesso spazio della politica <em>post-truth?</em>\n\nNon lo sappiamo ancora. Ma, mentre sale la marea nera del 2016, vediamo gente nelle nostre reti che pone domande nuove. Qualcosa di nuovo, qualcosa di grande si sta muovendo. Come sempre, staremo vicino alla nostra comunit\u00e0, e daremo una mano per quanto possiamo. Se anche tu aspetti da tempo che qualcosa si metta in moto; se vuoi contribuire a costruirlo, e a capire dove ci porter\u00e0, sentiamoci.

I went studying abroad 1 year to escape from this frustration.\n\nNow I'm back in Italy working on a service design project in order to create a career guidance service for graduates in the cultural-creative industries.\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">\u00a0</h3><h3 class=\"p1\">1 FRUSTRATION:</h3>I'm 24 years old from a small and somnolent italian city where I'm graduating in architecture.\n\nMy ride goes around my main FRUSTRATION: the current educational system.\n\nMain reason for this FRUSTRATION: we don't talk about aims in schools (a lovely book about aim-settings in school: happiness and education )\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">1 YEAR ABROAD:</h3>Last year I just walked around this frustration: I\u00a0went studying abroad: 6 months in Boston then 6 in Oslo. (parents paid for me + very small grants from EU programmes).\u00a0\n\nInvaluable experiences and a wealth of contacts\n\nEspecially in Boston I realized Europe is so tiny...\u00a0I'll always remember: when they were asking the home country of the students, they were usually forget to mention Europe\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">1 CITY/DISCIPLINE:</h3>During this year I've got the freedom to investigate my main interest: SERVICE DESIGN (and public services)\n\nSince I can't see an adequate mindset/market for designing services in Italy I'm planning to relocate to COPENHAGEN with my partner.\n\nAnother reason to relocate is the quality of life and especially work/life balance. (more on this later)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">1 THESIS:</h3>Now I'm writing my thesis/final project.\u00a0\n\nBut I prefer to consider this my first personal project out-of-school since I'm doing this project without any real professor/academic tutor\u2026 in fact I'm hacking the system in order to be able to have only external tutors.\u00a0\n\nI'm moving right now to a co-working space in Milan where I'll be able to receive frequent face-to-face feedback from people I esteem. (I'm and I will paying the expenses with freelance work as web developer and graphic designer).\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">ABOUT THIS PROJECT: IN GENERAL</h3>So the project is a career guidance/mentoring service for anyone willing to work in the\u00a0cultural and creative industries. More generally It's an invitation for students to look after graduation before it happens\u2026 something that doesn't really happen normally. \u00a0\n\nThere's already an ocean of useful advices and written experiences out there: they're just not curated or framed effectively (IMHO). Thus the main value I want to add is on curating, packaging and delivering what's already out there. (main inspiration:\u00a0<a href=\"http://instituteofyou.com/\"><span>http://instituteofyou.com/</span></a>\u00a0)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">ABOUT THIS PROJECT: ALREADY DONE</h3>So far to start this project I've organized five events (since 2009) in which alumni of my school come back 5 years from graduation to tell their life and work stories.\u00a0\n\nEye-opening for me and hopefully for my colleagues as well. For sure it gave me a consistent network and clarity on some of the opportunities out there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Thanks for reading!\u00a0</strong>\n\n<strong>P.S.

One part is composed of research, questionnaires, interviews, and workshops. The second part is about developing an actual artCommons, a model for sharing artwork outside or parallel to the\u00a0 monetized system of art production. Currently it's focused on visual arts, because that is my background.\n\nThe inspiration came from many places, I had been interested in this subject after reading about the Neoclassic period in France and the first attempts at making an all inclusive art public. Around this time I was researching the 'artist contract' of 1971, I thought it was very telling of how artists were and have been thinking about art all this time because this contract is strictly between the 'collector' and 'artist'- I thought, what about the public? What possibilities can arise from direct public interaction with art. I'm not referring to public art that is managed and mediated by state and city institutions. I was looking for a more intimate and direct experience.\n\nAlong these lines, I was interested in the free press syndication of art during the 60s that gave rise to the counter culture zine and underground newspapers of that time. These were early precursors to the Creative Commons movement. During Occupy Wall Street I found it fitting to try commoning within the movement. Working via consensus in working groups, we came up with\u00a0 ShareOWS but I think people didn't get the point. It was pretty much a wild west back then and before we knew it, the movement was already being squirrelled away into existing hierarchical institutions and private structures, never reaching the 99% and never de-monitized. It's not surprising because these histories of commoning are never taught or explored in popular education, and there are more examples than what I've just pointed out.\n\nLater, several of us converged under the umbrella of Making Worlds a commons working group. I worked with Maria for some time doing workshops here and there, basically talking to different communities. Later I began working with another member in Making Worlds on a pilot project in Jackson Heights Queens\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/553aceb32a3091fe3990b7d3f24491405093dad3.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f3423e8104cdc822fabf14d9f090f0a95e2bede2.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n2) What would you say the core objectives of your work are?\n\nGetting people to think of art as something we can share. Through this we would create new relationships and experiences with art. Hopefully this can give rise to a new collective experience thats both public and personal. There are many potential directions to go from that point. We need to move away from the alienating and de-powering idea that art is just something that people with money can buy and sell, or something that only intellectuals can make and understand. It's visual communication, simple as that, everyone should exercise and share it.\n\n3) This year the EdgeRyders unConference is centered around building a common language around the concept of Stewardship. Principally we see Stewardship as communities or individuals taking it upon themselves to care for social services, assets and infrastructure - as an alternative to examples where the state has failed to meet up to it\u2019s social contract or private interests have worked in favour of profit, over people. But in order to develop the concept we\u2019d like to understand what you think Stewardship means and how it might be relevant to the work that you do?\n\nWhen I started to work on artCommons pilot project, wording was very important. I wanted to get away from the terms loan, borrow, rent or lease. I decided to use the word 'care'. For me 'care' has many applications, care for family, friends, relationships - as well as care for resources, assets, and infrastructure. Where I come from 'care' is implies a delicate and preciousness and has nothing to do with money. It's part of life, eating is caring for your body, maintaining your home and habitat is caring for your environment, teaching and helping others is caring for your culture and society.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/961f0dfbba4cdc4a831d9c48d109429fb57d36a6.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br> \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1b4d3d1715b3e2d55ea1006a9eeb603ec1e610df.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n4) What are the main challenges you have faced in the course of your work and how did you overcome them?\n\nOne major challenge from my experience of doing a 1year pilot project in Jackson Heights is that commoning in a community that is not your own requires a lot of time on the ground, perhaps double or triple the amount of work because you have to take time to understand the geography, community make-up, issues, history etc. Each community has to evolve naturally and cannot simply be implemented from the outside. Luckily I had some very good local support to mediate these nuances.\n\n5) What mistakes have you made that you believe that others could learn from?\n\nThe idea of 'care' is way more complex than I first imagined. It's very very hard to understand another culture's understanding of care -especially if it is very different from your own. The best advice I can give is to be flexible and hope others are too. And hopefully we can do our best to create open systems or frameworks that are very flexible and open to the diversity in these vibrant communities.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1d725c9bdc5455c05b424930810306ea9b6f8c0f.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e20e1c2d8f43cf0279e0c6c122772a4a6b059d0e.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n6) What other projects, groups, organizations or networks do you see as essential or influential on what you do?\n\nI'm inspired by grassroots organizations that use networked or federated systems. Each node is interconnected in their work but not homogenous or designated more important than others. I hope we can grow artCommons organically in this way. Domestic Workers United and 596 Acres are two groups that use a grassroots approach to expanding and cultivating grassroots knowledge and energy.\n\nI'm also inspired by individuals I meet on the street. Since the first time we set up in a stand on the street, I found much encouragement from people we met there - they are the ones giving good practical advise based on experience. Books, or theorist, and institutions are a bit behind because of their bureaucratic structure - it takes a while for this street knowledge to get to those areas. So if you want feedback and inspiration just ask the people on the street.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-22 10:37:17", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 10:25:37.482875", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1231, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25178, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5347, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Ja Bitte!</b>\n\nMatthias sorry I missed this!

It was nearly the end of August when Kos Island turned into a battlefield during a registration procedure. Hundreds of protesting migrants demanding quick registration began blocking the main coastal road. The local police attempted to break up the crowd with batons and by spraying foam with fire extinguishers. An officer was being filmed slapping and shoving migrants queueing outside the local police station.\n\nMy grandmother came to mind and her story as a refugee child from the area of Pontos (Northern Turkey) in 1922. I just couldn\u2019t believe that something like that could happen again. Despite the fact that Greece, in the throes of its worst ever financial crisis, was straining to accommodate the inflow, most Greek islanders were doing their best. But still there was an ominous feeling in the air.\n\nAnd then I saw that photo. A young woman with her two frightened children hanging onto her arms. Walking to nowhere, barefoot. Beyond endurance, angry but determined to survive the crush. Fearless, though! Imperious! I got angry. I stood beside her, out there in the dust. I'm just one step away from being like her.\n\nThat moment I realized that there isn\u2019t any Deus ex Machina to save them. To save us.\n\nSo, I started thinking\u2026 What would I need if I were there? What should I carry to help my children withstand it? What should I bring with me for a little break? ...and their feet! What will happen to their feet? And the sun? It's hard being a parent in peace. In war and in refuge, only a hero.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd60223cf2c888c5940c4429e723613dcca32b2c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"439\">\n\nI wrote a list* with the necessities. The obvious, the necessary, even those things that seemed unnecessary. The goal was to ease the burden of parents, to give a smile to children. A breath until the next aid. A hope...\n\nI post the list in my private facebook profile. I couldn\u2019t imagine the impact of this simple action. In a few days people were coming to my place, bringing bags full of nearly everything! Friends, neighbors or strangers were coming to help. We\u2018ve been preparing backpacks and sending them to Idomeni, to the islands or anywhere they were needed. Many schools adopted the idea and soon the campaign went viral. In around 8 months, hundreds of people became mobilized and focused on helping this endless wave.\n\nIt seems that we could tell a lot of stories about, and because of this, but the point now is what emerged from this need. There's a lot of information coming out in the aftermath of this experience.\n\nThere\u2019s a mountain of questions that we didn\u2019t answer\u2026\n\n<em>Is there any kind of system in the world that could cope with that amount of people?\n\nWhat was wrong and why didn't anyone know how to react or to organize?\n\nWhy weren't we ready? Why didn't governments, NGO\u2019s and independent groups cooperate? And when they did, what happened?\n\nWhat socks are most appropriate for their long trek?\n\nHow can we fit all the necessary items in a backpack?\n\nAnd what about the weight?\n\nHow can we gather the right clothing from the world?\n\nHave you ever try to sort thousands of clothes?\n\nIs it true that women from Syria didn\u2019t want to wear rain boots?\n\nAnd what about UNHCR\u2019s wool blanket?\n\nAnd all those tons of food wrappers, wet wipes, bottles...?</em>\n\nSadly, it turns out that there was no rescue plan in place. Greece seems to be inefficient and Europe appears like an impregnable fortress. This brings up the question \u201cWhat if a sudden disaster left millions of Greeks or other Europeans homeless and helpless?\u201d\n\nLocal authorities and their services operated superficially while the government was obviously unprepared. On the other hand, citizens reacted vigorously and passionately despite the fact that they didn\u2019t mobilize immediately.\n\nIt\u2019s also notable that many conferences, workshops or unofficial brainstorming meetings took place and new technology-oriented groups were created.\u00a0 New ideas and solutions were proposed and innovative applications were developed from people all over the world. However, most of those didn\u2019t fall on fertile ground for wide use, thus must be investigated thoroughly in the future.\n\nDue to my profession as a fashion designer and manufacturer, when I heard about all those calls for clothing needs I started wondering who will manage all these diverse supplies. When facing a disaster, food and medical aid are considered top priorities but it\u2019s not widely known that wearing inappropriate clothing under extreme conditions can become life threatening.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that if we focus on specific issues we can come to interesting conclusions e.g. Public misinformation by \u201cofficial\u201d announcements that were based on internet searching or common knowledge about clothing. As a result, there was a shortage of A-shirts (tank tops) while, considered useless, thousands of used socks were gathered although it costs less to buy new ones. Also, acrylic socks were suggested as the most appropriate. But when there\u2019s no luxury of changing them anytime, other materials are more suitable like; wool, bamboo, cotton, tactel etc.\n\nObviously, a problem, arisen from common everyday items, is more complicated than initially thought and requires an expert's opinion.\n\nSo, without surprise, no one reached out to experts from the clothing sector for professional advice and assistance. Moreover both government and UNHCR ignored any proposals or contact efforts.\n\nSurely, the day after was going to be a nightmare. Inexperienced volunteers struggled to adequately classify, pack and distribute huge amounts of donations. Very often the same material had to be sorted again and again for multiple times. The inadequate coordination among government authorities, NGOs, solidarity groups and other stakeholders in combination with the anxiety of refugees led to a disappointing result. Large amounts of food, clothing, medicines and a lot of useless things (that could be a separate funny story), were being carried around Greece like a giant pinball machine. Unnecessary shipments, aid wasted, corrupted by mold, insects or still remain in inappropriate warehouses. A serious waste of resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the refugee crisis gave rise to a strong solidarity network and also an opportunity for local communities and the society in total. An innovative strategic plan seems to be a necessity, in order to coordinate and manage all the available resources successfully.\n\nWe should focus on organizing and training ourselves for cases of emergency. Based on the strength of these sharing communities, we should work, in innovative ways, which could bring people together around common concerns, recognize and increase their skills and knowledge and instill in them a belief that they can make a difference.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s important to develop a survival handbook with the aim to provide \u201chow-to\u201d guidance based on practical experience in combination with academic knowledge. And the challenge is to respond to all these arisen questions. Or add new.\n\n\u201cCould humanitarianism be evolved as a profession or it could be a new way of living?\u201d\n\nP. S.\n\nMore than 1/5 of donations is unsuitable for the refugees, thus is channeled to other vulnerable groups directly or in cooperation with already existing structures.\n\nMost of the volunteers gave up, burned out or feeling unable to help. Meanwhile the main responsible for this failure get paid.\n\nMore than 60.000 refugees stuck in Greece.

IMHO, we need a lot more folks like him who can face the bleak and bitter horror of the predicament we are all in, and lay it out clearly, honestly and fearlessly.\u00a0\n\nI think you are a bit confused, Lyne. 'We' is an abstracted concept, there can be hundreds, thousands, of 'we's' and until the precise referent is defined, nobody can be clear as to whom or what is being talked about.\u00a0\n\nLikewise with the notion 'we are all one'. That may well be the ultimate truth, in a religious or philosophical context, ( personally I believe it is ), but then to pretend that the distinctions and divisions don't exist is ridiculous. Such airy-fairy polyanna nonsense isn't going to solve our problems, is it ? It would be nice if everyone <em>could </em>raise their consciousness to a higher level, but what chance is there of that happening ? To build a strategy upon that premise is as unrealistic as planning your personal life upon the assumption that you will win the lottery.\u00a0\n\nYou and I are separate beings, <em>two</em>, not one, and have individual self-centred interests and pursuits which may remain forever opposed. To pretend otherwise is delusion, isn't it ? And so it is for all groups and entities.\u00a0\n\nTo lump all humans into an aggregate of 'we the people' may sound good rhetorically, but it's meaningless, it's like saying 'we the fish', and ignoring the fact that some fish survive by eating other fish, some fish require niches that others do not, and so on.\n\nI do believe that every single 'thing', that we distinguish as an independent form or entity, are all facets of the One, the greater Universe, sure, that's not hard to grasp or even to demonstrate scientifically. And if, say, I'm walking in the countryside, that's a great way to experience being. However, if I'm in a fight or conflict, I have very well-defined boundaries, where I stop and all the rest begins, and I'll defend those boundaries, just as all the other living organisms do, with violence if necessary. Don't blame me for that. I didn't design the system. Great White Sharks and Orcas eat nice cuddly seals. Foxes eat chickens. They have to do it, not a choice. So, whilst everything is One, everything is eating everything else, all the time. We people are merely constituent parts of that system.\u00a0\n\nYou can insist that there is no 'you'. Okay, lay down and let the hungry tigress devour you, to feed her starving cubs. It's your right and privilege to do that. It's probably a generous and noble act, if it's done with complete understanding. But to expect <em>everyone else</em> to have that attitude is delusion. Starving sailors adrift in tiny boats draw lots to decide who will be murdered and eaten so the others can survive.\n\nWhen resources are abundant, wealth easily come by, then we can all be friendly and relaxed and generous. But in times of hardship, shortage, crisis, extreme competition, what happens ? Look at history. There are lessons to learn.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-19 08:25:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.930467", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 616, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12258], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4642, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 4609, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>I had promised <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0to write a post about the challenges of working in the holy month of Ramadan in Egypt. For the duration of June 18 - July 17 we fast everyday, abstaining from food, drink, curses and all other vices from sunset till sunrise. This being Ramadan, I took my\u00a0long time until publishing this unofficial/unscientific personal account of working in Ramadan.\u00a0</em>\n\n----------------------------\n\n<strong>Days ( -10\u00a0\u2192\u00a0 0 )</strong>\n\nRamadan practically starts 10 days before, when traffic intensifies and scheduling meetings grow harder by the day. People start preparing for the fasting month by stocking up on food, inflation is actually at its peak during this time of the year, and set arrangements. A lot of professionals designate Ramadan as their yearly sabbatical and arrange accordingly.\u00a0\n\n<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 32px;\">Days ( 0\u00a0\u2192\u00a0 5 )</strong>\n\nThe first 5 days in Ramadan are a virtual standstill. First, people get accustomed to the fasting. Second, this is the time for grand yearly family gatherings, with all it entails in preparation. Reaching people by phone is generally hard.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Dilemma: When to call?</strong>\n\nIn Ramadan, the working hours shorten. Government normally operates between 10am -3pm, and the private sector probably between 9am-4pm or so. Traffic is generally hell starting 3pm, and only relaxes at 6pm, 1 hour before Iftar. Further, it is generally bad decorum to call anybody in the 3 hours or so before Iftar.\u00a0\n\nIftar this year is generally around 7pm, and normally lasts an hour. After Iftar, you have intensive TV programming until dawn basically. Ramadan is the most intensive consumer month (ironically) in the year, and this year there are 6 high profile TV series that everybody is expected to watch somehow. Calls after Iftar are hit &amp; misses. Meetings are generally set for Sohour (pre-fasting fill up meal) at 11pm or so.\u00a0\n\nMost people partake in the Taraweeh prayers, which start at 9pm-11pm or so.\u00a0\n\n<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 32px;\">Days ( 5 \u2192 \u00a020 )</strong>\n\nLife adjusts and it is as normal as it gets during the year.\u00a0\n\n<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 32px;\">Days ( 20 \u2192 \u00a030 )\u00a0</strong>\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0627\u062e\u0631\u00a0\n\nThe last 10 days in Ramadan are even more special as they are the prime time of the year for prayers. Generally, people intensify their prayers that time of the year, and start planning for the Eid, the 3 days following Ramadan. Again, it becomes more difficult to reach people or arrange events.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Eid</strong>\n\nEid is the muslim equivalent of christmas and prime time for people to leave the city and travel. It is a national holiday of 3 days, with the weekend normally lumped in as well. Again, bad decorum to meet people then.\u00a0\n\n<span>--------------------------</span>\n\n<strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong>\n\nWith people waking up at different times, going to sleep at different times, the 5 hours or so around Iftar generally unavailable, and the evening prayers it is on case-by-case that you can determine meetings or phone calls. Add to that the difficulty of fasting in the hot summer month, and you working in Ramadan is generally much slower than else during the year. This is also the reason the first community call in Egypt somewhat failed with no participants, and no other calls were scheduled.\u00a0\n\n--------------------------\n\n<em>The intent of this article is to serve as a knowledge base for next years down the row.

Who can use Open Ethnographer on Edgeryders</h2>\n\nOpen Ethnographer allows ethnographic coding of the websites on which it is installed. Edgeryders is one of these website. However, ordinary users of Edgeryders do not have access to the OpenEthnographer interface. In order to use it, you will need to be logged in with an identity that has ethnographer privileges. You can keep using your Edgeryders account: we will assign it one of two roles:\n\n1. The Ethnographer role allows you to see other researchers' annotations; create, edit and delete your own annotations; create, edit and delete ethno codes.\n\n2. The Ethnographer Admin role allows you to do all of the above, and also edit and delete the annotations of other researchers.\n\nIf you want one, contact <a href=\"mailto:alberto@edgeryders.eu?subject=Can%20I%20use%20OpenEthnographer%20on%20the%20Edgeryders%20platform&amp;body=%3CTell%20us%20about%20your%20research%3E\">Alberto</a>.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Using Open Ethnographer</h2>\n\nOpen Ethnographer is an open source tool for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), which is a way to systematize and understand long chunks of text and to make sense out of it. Usually, there are 4 main steps in the QDA analysis.\n\n* **Preliminary coding.** A thorough reading of the content that leads to a draft list of codes, or tags, for certain portions of text.\n\n* **Coding.** A careful reading, this time assigning a \u2018code\u2019/\u2019tag to a relevant portion of a given text.\n\n* **Building categories.** Group codes into categories for further analysis.\n\n* **Analysis.** The content of the categories is described with references back to the text and the original quotations.\n\nOpen Ethographer (OE) is used for coding the content of a webpage without downloading it first. It is a simple to use and intuitive tool, and the instructions are below.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. How to assign a code?</h3>\n\nTo assign a code, select a portion of a text and then either write a new code in the pop-out bubble, or select from a drop-down menu, which contains all codes which you have entered before:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/196b625355421a8457dd408954c267da0a0044d9.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"243\">\n\nThis is what an assigned code will look like:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3dc68a6f4eb961e99f823fd7b9b866773a11e49c.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"230\">\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2.

Installing Open Ethnographer for normal use</h2>\n\nThis will follow the normal Drupal ways of installing a module (ideally just <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush dl openethnographer</code> and <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush en openethnographer</code>). However, we will create software packages only when version 1.0 is out. Until then, you will have to work along the installation instructions for developers below.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Installing Open Ethnographer for development use</h2>\n\nThis assumes that:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Drupal is installed, with its document root at <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/var/www/drupal</code>.</li>\n\n<li>The command line \"Drupal shell\" <a href=\"https://github.com/drush-ops/drush#readme\"><code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">drush</code></a> is <a href=\"http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/\">install</a>ed.</li>\n\n<li>You keep the source code at <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/src</code>.</li>\n\n<li>PHP5 is installed, including the required SQLite 3 extension. On Ubuntu 14.10, this means:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite</code></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">npm</code>, <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">coffee</code> and related NodeJS instrumentation is installed. On Ubuntu 14.10, this means:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Install npm.\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">sudo apt-get install npm</code></li>\n\n<li>Install nodejs, and call it \"node\" as expected by the non-Ubuntu coffeescript variant that we have to use. [<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/20344551/1270008\">source</a>]\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">sudo apt-get install nodejs</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cd /usr/local/bin; sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs node</code></li>\n\n<li>Install coffeescript with npm [<a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\">source</a>]. Do not install it from the Ubuntu package <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">coffee</code>, since that variant does not have the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">-m</code> option needed for compiling Annotator.\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">sudo npm install -g coffee-script</code></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nInstallation steps:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Clone our git repository.</strong>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cd /src</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">git clone https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer.git</code></li>\n\n<li><strong>Optionally, fork us on Github.</strong> If you plan to work on the code, you may want to create your own fork. <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\">Follow the instructions on github</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Build Annotator.</strong> The <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/blob/master/annotatorjs/HACKING.markdown\">full instructions</a> are in the repo. Here's what it comes down to:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cd openethnographer/annotatorjs</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">npm install .</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">make</code>\n\nOptionally, build a non-minified version of Annotator, which is useful for debugging. Unfortunately the minified version's filename is hard-coded into the annotator Drupal module, so we have to place the non-minified version there, overwriting the minified one:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">make annotator-full.js</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cp pkg/annotator-full.js pkg/annotator-full.min.js</code></li>\n\n<li><strong>Make annotator available to Drupal.</strong>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">mkdir -p /var/www/drupal/sites/all/libraries</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">ln -s /src/openethnographer/annotatorjs/pkg /var/www/drupal/sites/all/libraries/annotator</code></li>\n\n<li><strong>Make the annotator and annotation modules available to Drupal.</strong>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">ln -s /src/openethnographer/drupal_annotator /var/www/drupal/sites/all/modules/annotator</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">ln -s /src/openethnographer/drupal_annotation /var/www/drupal/sites/all/modules/annotation</code></li>\n\n<li><strong>Enable the modules using drush.</strong> (drush will tell you to also install and enable some dependency modules, which you should do)\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cd /var/www/drupal</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush pm-enable annotator</code></li>\n\n<li><strong>Configure jquery_update to use JQuery 1.8.</strong> For that, go to <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/admin/config/development/jquery_update</code>. (Officially, Annotator requires jQuery 1.9 now to prevent issue <a href=\"https://github.com/openannotation/annotator/issues/319\">#319</a>. However, 1.9 will break the loading of CKEditor (via ckeditor module) in a Drupal 7 frontend, in both comment fields and node body fields (in the latter, switching to source view and back is a temp workaround though). jQuery 1.9 also breaks collapsible combined formfields in the backend, though you can use jQuery update to set 1.8 for the backend since Annotator is not needed there. In any case, it is better to stay with jQuery 1.8 in the frontend (as mentioned in  <a href=\"http://drupal.stackexchange.com/a/121460/16305\">older instructions</a>) except you need to fight the mentioned issue \\#319. Which will not happen for everyone though.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Enable the Annotator plugins we need.</strong> Do that at <code class=\"content-output\">/admin/config/content/annotator</code>. We need:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Store</strong> (enables persistence)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Drupal Node</strong> (our own plugin, makes nodes annotateable by node ID)</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://docs.annotatorjs.org/en/latest/plugins/tags.html\">Tags</a></strong> (enables tagging annotations with keywords)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Sidebar</strong> (a sidebar to view and manage annotations in the current text, based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/albertjuhe/annotator_view\">annotator_view</a> Annotator plugin)</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://docs.annotatorjs.org/en/latest/plugins/unsupported.html\">Unsupported</a></strong> (shows a message if the current browser is not supported)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Permissions</strong> (needed for configured annotation view / edit permissions to be effective, and to show user names on annotations). Note: The order of plugins in the list of activated plugins is relevant, since it defines the relative rendering order. We want the permissions plugin after the tags plugin, to get author names at the bottom of annotation bubbles. To get this done, activate the first four plugins, save, then activate \"Permissions\", save again.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Adjust the annotator module's node selection.</strong> Stay at resp. go to <code class=\"content-output\">/admin/config/content/annotator</code> and in the jQuery selector field (containing by default <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">.node</code>) enter a jQuery selector that will select all DOM elements holding field contents that you want to be annotatable. Our version of the Drupal annotator module generates special attributes for all tags immediately around field content, so these are the simplest option to use in the jQuery expression. (Eventually, these attributes will be only generated for fields you marked with an \"enable annotations\" option, and then this option will be always <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">[data-annotator-target]</code> and no longer visible.) For now, here is a selection of examples for this option. (And be sure to not select too many (&gt;20) tags, as that would slow down or even crash Firefox. It is not a problem in Chrome / Chromium.)\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">.block-content &gt; .node [data-annotator-target*=\"body/\"]</code>: by enforcing that <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">.block-content</code> is a direct parent of <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">.node</code>, we exclude node previews that are rendered in OG groups' views rather than as blocks; we do that because such previews would add a huge number of unnecessary Annotator instances which can crash Firefox, and are of no use anyway.</li>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">[data-annotator-target*=\"/body/\"],[data-annotator-target*=\"/comment_body/\"]</code>: more precise selection of body fields, but in effect usually equivalent to the above</li>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">[data-annotator-target^=\"node\"], [data-annotator-target^=\"comment\"]</code>: all fields of the \"node\" and \"comment\" entity types and nothing else</li>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">[data-annotator-target^=\"node\"][data-annotator-target*=\"/body/\"], [data-annotator-target^=\"comment\"][data-annotator-target*=\"/body/]</code>: most precise selector for exactly the node boy and comment comment_body fields. But too long for the input field :)</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Adjust the annotation module's permissions.</strong> Can be done at <code class=\"content-output\">/admin/people/permissions</code>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Make sure the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">taxonomy_term</code> view is disabled.</strong> Otherwise, it would grab the URLs where our quotation manager resides, making it ineffective. Disabling it can be done at <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/admin/structure/views</code>. If you had to disable it, clear the cache afterwards: <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush cc all</code>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Configure the taxonomy_display Drupal module.</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>On <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/admin/structure/taxonomy/openethnographer/display</code> on vertical tab \"Custom Display Settings\" enable \"Taxonomy term page\".</li>\n\n<li>On <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/admin/structure/taxonomy/openethnographer/display/full</code> on vertical tab \"Term page display\" set \"Term display: OpenEthnographer Term display\" and \"Associated content display: Hidden\".</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n<li><strong>(optional) Install Taxonomy Manager and Term Merge.</strong> It will allow you better management of tags, incl. merging them (Open Ethnographer is integrated with term_merge).\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush dl term_merge</code> and <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush en term_merge</code></li>\n\n<li><code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush dl taxonomy_manager</code> and <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush en taxonomy_manager</code></li>\n\n<li>Adjust the Taxonomy Term and Term Merge permissions for the Open Ethnographer vocabulary at <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/admin/people/permissions</code>.</li>\n\n<li>You can now manage and merge tags at <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/admin/structure/taxonomy_manager/voc/openethnographer</code>.</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe effect of this setup is already that commenting becomes limited to node text (comments will follow later). One can also add comments and tags, but tags are not saved yet. You can find a list of all currently saved annotations at <code class=\"content-output\">/admin/content/annotation</code>.\n\n<strong>Troubleshooting:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>General troubleshooting for installing Annotator in Drupal: see  <a href=\"http://drupal.stackexchange.com/q/105631\">this Drupal Answers question</a>.</li>\n\n<li>If your annotations are not saved (<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">503 Forbidden</code> errors on <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">POST https://example.com/annotation/api/annotations</code>), make sure your web server user (mostly <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">www-data</code> for Apache2) has read access to your Drupal document root directory. This is needed even if your PHP scripts are executed as a different user.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Making and submitting changes</h2>\n\nCode changes in the Drupal annotator and annotation modules (subdirectories <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">drupal_annotator</code> and <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">drupal_annotation</code>) will be immediately effective and visible on the site. Only if you have JavaScript and CSS aggregation enabled (in dev environments you normally should not), you also need a cache clear: <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush cc all</code>.\n\nCode changes to Annotator (subdirectory <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">annotatorjs</code>) require a rebuild, by running <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">make</code> in that subdirectory. Again, if you have JavaScript / CSS aggregation enabled, you need a cache clear: <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush cc all</code>.\n\nWhen you are ready to share your work, push a commit to <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\">your own fork</a>, then <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\">send a pull request</a> to the <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer\">edgeryders/openethnographer</a> <a href=\"http://entrypark.co.uk/\">replica watches</a> repository.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. Pulling and integrating team's changes</h2>\n\nChanges come in via pull requests (internally, references to some commits in others' forked versions). To integrate them:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Create a new branch and check out  the pull request into it. This is explained in the \"You can also merge branches on the command line\" section next to Github's \"Merge pull request\" button, and also <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/\">here</a>.</li>\n\n<li>If the changes include database schema updates (here: changes in <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">drupal_annotation/annotation.install</code>), uninstall and re-enable the module (because we do not yet use scripts for <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">updatedb.php</code>):\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush pm-disable annotation</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush pm-uninstall annotation</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush pm-enable annotation</code></li>\n\n<li>If the pull request contains changes to JavaScript or CSS files <em>and</em> you have aggregation enabled, refresh the cache:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush cc all</code></li>\n\n<li>If there are code changes to Annotator, rebuild it:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cd annotatorjs/</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">make</code></li>\n\n<li>Test and if needed modify the pull request's code state, then commit your changes back to Github.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--7\">7. Pulling upstream changes</h2>\n\nWe use git subtrees to track the upstream code for the projects we rely on. To merge upstream changes:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">git subtree pull --prefix drupal_annotation git://git.drupal.org/project/annotation.git 7.x-1.x</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">git subtree pull --prefix drupal_annotator git://git.drupal.org/project/annotator.git 7.x-1.x</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">git subtree pull --prefix annotatorjs https://github.com/openannotation/annotator.git v1.2.x</code>\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--\">8. Installing vanilla Annotator and its Drupal modules</h2>\n\nYou probably don't want to do this, as it misses out the code developed for Open Ethnographer. However, if you want a plain vanilla setup of Open Ethnographer inside Drupal, here's how:\n\nFollow the instructions above, but\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Download Annotator.</strong> We use version 1.2.9, which is the latest release in the 1.2 series. (Much work has gone into the upcoming 2.0 series, but there is no release yet, its API is unstable still [<a href=\"https://github.com/openannotation/annotator#readme\">source</a>], and most importantly, there is no Drupal integration yet for Annotator 2.0. So we stick with the 1.2 series. Unfortunately it also means that whatever plugins we develop for Annotator 1.2 will have to be ported to Annotator 2.0 lateron \u2026 .) To download it, instead of step 3 \"Build Annotator\" above, do this:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">cd sites/all/libraries</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">wget https://github.com/openannotation/annotator/releases/download/v1.2.9/annotator-full.1.2.9.zip</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">mv annotator-full.1.2.9/ annotator/</code></li>\n\n<li><strong>Install the Drupal modules for Annotator integration.</strong> Instead of steps 4 and 5 above, do this:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush pm-download annotator &amp;&amp; drush pm-enable annotator</code>\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">drush pm-download annotation &amp;&amp; drush pm-enable annotation</code></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--9\">9. Installing and using RQDA</h2>\n\nAfter exporting your data from Open Ethnographer into RQDA format, do this to start analyzing your .rqda file with RQDA:\n\nStart RQDA and watch the results:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Open a Linux virtual terminal (like <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">gnome-terminal</code>, <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">xterm</code> etc.).</li>\n\n<li>Open R by typing <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">R</code> into your Linux virtual terminal.</li>\n\n<li>Type <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">library(RQDA)</code> and press enter.</li>\n\n<li>Start the program by typing <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">RQDA()</code> and pressing enter.</li>\n\n<li>Open and study your new generated .rqda file in the GUI that appears.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSome documentation pointers for using RQDA and R itself:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/documentation_2.html\">RQDA user manual</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/RQDA/docs?tab=w\">RQDA function reference</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/RQDA/docs/RQDATables\">RQDA SQLite database schema docs</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html\">SQLite language reference</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf\">R quick reference card</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--10\">10.

And they really liked the idea of getting out of the city and being on a farm with the baby when she's older.\u00a0\n\nActually, now I realise on reading your session proposal that the underlying theme of basically all our conversations the past few days was a combination wanting to escape the city but not feeling that you can for social or professional reasons...and how to re-engineer one's lifestyle rather than just taking \"vacations\" from it.\n\nOn a side note it would be interesting to hear a comparison of experiences setting up different kinds of rural tourism in different parts of the workd, For example, you may be interested in learning more about the long trek organised by <a href=\"/u/andrea_paoletti\">@andrea.paoletti</a> and others in the same region where LOTE4 is located (5 days). Its really cool and they do a great job of bringing together lovely people around these neturalwalks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-01 00:17:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.722839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25962, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1265, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Heart failures, political failures</b>\n\nThe reality of today's world is that all of our lives are entangled.

Today Citybugs.org is a social platform providing the possibility to talk about communal issues of different cities. The users of the platform simply report on daily unsolved issues in their communities. Citybugs.org is synchronized with the Google dynamic map which ensures the interactivity of the website. The tool presents visually the exact location of the report, as well as collect and stick all existing issues and challenges in a unified place.</em>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7525920fac36beaf9df56387aa7d9b5ff99a28ba.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n<em>CityBugs.am is basically designed to streamline complaints by distributing concerns to different subdivisions of the municipality. Visitors to the site can also follow the status of how their issues are being resolved.</em>\n\n<em>I recently met @Hovhannes Aghajanyan - one of the co-founders in one of the few shady spots in town in the scorching heat of Yerevan and we talked about the project for a couple of hours. Below is the outcome of the interview.</em>\n\n<strong>How you got started and current situation</strong>\n\n<em>The initiative was created in winter 2011 when 2 colleagues -  Hovhannes who is a graduate of YSU IT Dpt. and Arman the Founder and CEO of X-TECH IT company learnt about a competition organised by Yerevan city hall together with Microsoft Innovation Center to spotlight IT solutions for Yerevan city from Facebook and decided to participate in it.</em>\n\nEverything started when we spotted a garbage problem by our office building - there was a huge pile that was growing every day and no one was collecting it. The competition made us think of a social start up to help the city with the idea to allow people to improve their community by actively suggesting and seeing how the issues get solved. CityBugs was one of the shortlisted projects and in 2012 Eurasia Partnership Foundation funded the website implementation.\n\nWe made a presentation at Barcamp in May 2012  and everyone got interested, though some said it won\u2019t work as not enough people will be engaged and the city hall will not collaborate. Shortly after we gathered a 5 people team of freelancers and started working on the design of the website. We also started thinking about developing mobile apps - social advertisements for youtube,etc and hired a director who filmed the social ads to promote CItyBugs.\n\nOur team initially consisted of young IT specialists interested in social bud, we didn\u2019t invest money on the project but used our strong digital communication skills and experience. The website came to life in October 2012 and then we made a deal with the city hall - it dpt/digital communication responsible - the authorities agreed to collaborate and be responsive to the issues posted by the citizens.\n\nShortly after we started the social media campaign - Arman had a huge recognition in IT community, while I have always been socially active, participating in many initiatives, thus all these networks helped to present and spread the word about the project. We have participated in all the relevant community events securing the visibility of the project and using platforms like Facebook as well as community groups and events (online and offline) where we were teaching entrepreneurship and telling the story of CityBugs.\n\nWe also started working with media, having meetings with them - explaining what and why we are doing this. We established the collaboration with the City Hall in November 2012 and  right now we have 5000-6000 users + 511 posted issues in total(201 solved, 24 unsolved and the rest is pending).\n\nOnce the funding finished, we applied for a second funding - but we continued working on it without waiting for the second funding and we started thinking how to sell this to other communities as a social startup to become sustainable. <strong>I think the key to success is to keep on working on a project even when there is no funds available while waiting for the next funding, as most of the projects stop as soon as the funding is over and then it is very difficult to restart again.</strong>\n\nWe have no legal status except creative commons, as CityBugs is not a NGO but a social startup and we always got the funding as individuals. Whenever we need to be represented as a company we use X_Tech as an umbrella company.\n\nWe started advertising in 3 languages, making tutorials, working on internet literature. Other communities in Armenia became interested and started the project  in Gyumri, Vanadzor and Armavir - we managed to find some people in those areas to start the same thing there, organised trainings, as the umbrella project.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9431b1060033145e0919b57e5ca3f54b2222b7b1.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\nWe also had it in Stepanakert - the project worked for a while but stopped later as the center doing the project closed.\n\nFrom 2013 we started working with international companies to find partners abroad, we started participating in many international events and IT based competitions and won many awards. In 2014 we participated in<a href=\"http://www.youthaward.org/\"> European Youth Awards</a> in Gratz, Austria and won in the category of <a href=\"http://www.youthaward.org/taxonomy/term/80/33\">Create Your Culture!</a> which was the first time for a project from Armenia.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/btS5ZrXjTTY\n\nThis year we participated in the <a href=\"http://www.youthaward.org/winnersevent/2014-winners-event\">WYSA Brazil</a> winners festival and thanks WYSA now we have a global network of partners and supporters. We are also a part of the jury of the World Youth Summit Awards.\n\nNowadays we are working with the existing network and we already have city bugs in Sao Paolo and Toronto.\n\n<strong>Who's involved:  Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skillsets (what are individual team members good at?) Any partnerships?</strong>\n\n\"Currently there are 3 people in the team and we all work on action groups, e-volunteering, international strategies and communication and social business development. Here\u2019s what everyone is good at:\n\nArman - Product Management, Development\n\nHovhannes - Project management, Operations, Digital communications, Digital strategies\n\nTatevik - International communications, Social business and Development strategies\"\n\n<strong>Hypothesis guiding the work: \"I believe that to achieve x, we need to do y, through z\"</strong>\n\nWe are actively promoting CSR in Armenia - this is a social commitment from the team to use our experience and knowledge to help the community. As for the international development - it\u2019s for business as this is more acceptable in the west.\n\nOne of our strategy levels is to try to build an e-volunteering network to register on the website.The aim is to let the e-volunteers take the initiative and to give solutions to local problems staying global. Normally users present existing local problems, e-volunteering is all about presenting Global problems - for the city all together. We want to start fundraising/crowdfunding platform to give solution to existing problems.\n\nOur platform is based on members who write about a problem, which appears on the map, with a possibility to add a solution/photo/video. An internal structure allows the problem to be categorized into a special category - e-governance system to be forwarded to the institution that is responsible for this problem.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9be1bc95a4cd739ef60f68380cfe4a998116f8f0.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n<strong>What your main objectives are/why you do this? The target is not simply to report issues, but also to connect with the municipality in solving them. Thanks to CityBugs ordinary citizens have the opportunity to discuss specific problems with like-minded people or group</strong> over an unresolved issue trying to find ways for its solution, but also to track the response by the municipality and document it.    \n\nAmong major aims of this platform is also to raise and make evident positive changes occurring in various districts of Yerevan like constructions and renovation, condominiums and local governmental agencies etc. The idea is to improve the communication between governmental organizations and society, ensure transparency of the municipality activities, and raise awareness about existing communal and social issues in different cities. Everything is open on the website, all the problems have their status and the platform is very transparent.        \n\n<strong>What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less?</strong>\n\n\"I enjoy creating an impact - finding solution to problems and seeing the result of the work. Lack of time is the main problem as I also have a full time job and have to attend many events so I often multitask.\"\n\n<strong>What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily</strong>\n\nWhenever we have time we are reading all reports, participating in relevant social events. I think the main key of success is not to stop when there is no more funding, we finance all our fees right now but we don't want to stop. My opinion is that one should never kill a project when the funding is over.\n\n<strong>What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</strong>\n\nWe need real partners who would be ready to share the impact of City Bugs in their communities. CityBugs could be a mapping tool for e.g. drugs with a user based content, mapping the areas where they sell drugs or all the cafes with vegan food, bicycle accidents, etc.\n\n<strong>What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</strong>\n\nWe could help with digital strategy, everything to do with digital and social enterprise development, creating social impact. We are European Youth Awards ambassadors - can help with contacts and networks from WYSA.\n\n<strong>Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work? Who currently supports it, how and why?</strong>\n\nWe pay for the website hosting, technical support as our platform is integrated with Facebook and Google, if they change something the website won\u2019t work properly. We also pay for the day to day programming support, Facebook ads, international events participation costs, meeting partners abroad, etc.\n\n<strong>Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere?</strong>\n\nInternationally there are lots of ideologically similar projects, e.g. open source platforms like Ushaidi project - from Nigeria, open source platform. Ours is more flexible as we have created it all by ourselves and it is local.\n\n<em>I showed Hovhannes<a href=\"https://milrir.crowdmap.com/\"> Mi Lrir Initiative </a>(an initiative of Armenian females against street harassment - the story is coming up soon) website which has a mapping tool as well and he told me they use Ushaidi as well and they will try to collaborate with the girls.</em>\n\n<strong>Important players affecting the work? (locally and internationally)</strong>\n\nWe are completely independent, nothing really special affecting our work. Government maybe, social media development, change of mindset of people which is the most important. The prizes we win does not affect our users, so our aim is to have a tangible impact on our users and community.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/612e403e1139b96180a03c7725bdadf255541b9a.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<strong>Long term perspective: any Business or sustainability plan?  </strong>\n\nOur plan is to have partners in different cities and build lots of different projects on our platform for social good. We hope to sell this platform abroad for other communities (we have already implemented it in Toronto and Sao Paolo) thus earning the money to pay our expenses.\n\nWe are also working on the e-volunteers project - community building for activists to communicate and find solution to problems in their and other communities online.\n\nOur project is completely non-profit and is simply a citizen reporting tool - we got no ads, nothing to sell, no banners, it is our policy. We do not want to commercialize this project based on ads.\n\n<strong>What do you believe are the most important projects locally that are relevant to the work you are doing at this moment?</strong>\n\nI am a member of Global Shapers Yerevan Hub which is a part of World Economic Forum. There is a community of 10 people in Armenia hub all doing different projects - e.g. Orange financed building a library in Ijevan, TUMO - for orphans from regions to go to TUMO 3 times a week. I am a trustee of the Awesome Foundation, I am an expert for Kolba Lab and we are always supporting each other.\n\n<strong>How about the concepts of Collaboration .. and Mutual Support?</strong>\n\nWe always need to involve and mix people in the projects - from other projects and countries. Our advantage is that CityBugs does not need a space - it is all based on users\u2019 development.

However, unfortunately, this is not the mindset of the many Irish citizens at the moment. Apart from a select few controversial issues, there seems to be a general sense of apathy towards taking active roles in addressing our societal problems and creating a better future for Ireland. As far as I can see, this is mainly due to a combination of:</span>\n\n<span>- distractions of modern life</span>\n\n<span>- inadequate political and sociological education, and a lack of cultivation of critical thought in our school system</span>\n\n<span>- a feeling of disenfranchisement due to a series of corrupt and/or incapable governments</span>\n\n<span>- lack of easy-to-use infrastructure for the public to communicate their opinions and desires to government and have those opinions and desires reflected in legislation.</span>\n\n<div style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<span>While the distractions of modern life may live on, the group I work with \"Grassroots Ireland\" looks to tackle the other three issues.</span>\n\n<span>We are a grassroots, community-led movement that aims to empower people to become active citizens through providing simplified education opportunities and resources on useful topics such as politics, sociology, law and economics, so that people can understand and begin to shape the systems that govern their lives.</span>\n\n<span>This, along with the promotion of critical thought and positive mental and physical health, we believe, will naturally breed community development and social progress.</span>\n\n<div style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<span>One project we are currently working on in this regard is direct/liquid democracy software that will act as a platform for debating, voting and also as a resource for relevant information and simplified summaries of existing and proposed legislation.</span>\n\n<span>The plan is to spread the application nationwide in an open-source manner and generate enough interest and demand from the public that the government have no choice but to adopt it, or an improved form, voted on by the public.</span>\n\n<span>In our society convenience is often considered to be king. If we make it as easier for people to educate themselves, develop well-informed opinions and give them a means of expressing those opinions, this will lead to increase in confidence, and a desire to participate in the democratic process.</span>\n\n<div style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<span>Some other projects we are working on at the moment are:</span>\n\n<span>- A community hub that will act as a caf\u00e9 and safe physical space to build a community and active citizenry around, for educational talks, wellness classes of all kinds, meetings of community groups and just somewhere to encourage the discussion of important issues</span>\n\n<span>- A community garden and vegetable growing co-op.</span>\n\n<span>- A renewable energy co-op</span>\n\n<div style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<span>While it would be great if we could release the direct democracy software and everything would sort itself, we are not banking on it. We realise that people can be skeptical of any kind of change and also reluctant to accept any more responsibility than they already have.</span>\n\n<span>So, as a grassroots organisation first and foremost, we hope to use the above social enterprises to provide working alternative models on the ground in our communities to show them that there are better and fairer ways of doing things.</span>\n\n<span>We believe that through social enterprises like the ones above, which are scaleable and replicable, we can work with and change the systems that exist from within. \u201cHack the system\u201d, as they say. I\u2019ve recently attended An \u00c1it Eile\u2019s pre-unMonastery event in Cregg Castle and see even more opportunities for positive change and connections between the many initiatives in Galway and beyond.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-13 14:15:54", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 09:29:28.885900", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1606, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32992, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 45, "raw": "<b>The \"two things\" issue</b>\n\n@Costantino\n\nWe'll make sure we do.

This expresses the feeling of balance and dynamics in the term 'edge-riding'. Initially we looked for\u00a0one powerful image, but gradually we found that the very many possibilities of the double tangram better fit your organization. We therefore propose to make a so-called \"animated logo\". This can\u00a0digitally be used on the website but also for a newsletter or on facebook. The animated logo consists of a number of applicable tangram shapes which change from one into another.</em> Find out more about their work at <a href=\"http://www.rossellab.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">www.rossellab.eu</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ellenvedder.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ellenvedder.nl</a>\n\n<strong>Motivation:</strong>Our move in setting up a poll was intended as a sign of respect and engagement towards our fledgling community, the message being that we \u2013 as we do an exercise of wiki policy \u2013 are prepared to accept external input even on the way we look. The poll is meant to give us an idea of where our fledgling community wants to go in terms of look and feel, but we make the final decision. The reason being that in building Edgeryders, the team is constantly navigating a complex space with many many stakeholders involved- from individual participants to representatives of national governments. To any given design challenge there are an infinite number of possible solutions and we believe in the power of the crowd - the more input from the more diverse a participant base, the smarter and better the end result. It's not the same as design by committee, which I (Nadia, creative direction) do not believe in at all - but it's about opening the space for a conversation with the community when there are several possible directions to move in. We selected Ellen and Rosella's submission because it communicates more about what the platform actually is about and concept is scalable and can be used as a framework for producing more visual content for the platform. Also it is legible and easily distinguished. The form can easily be adapted to suit different implementations of the site's visual identity. Finally it was pushed to the top three by the community without much campaigning and resonated with the team.\n\n<strong>How Edgeryders will use it:</strong> Although we cannot commit to using it as the official Edgeryders logo, we plan to include elements of the concept in the final site.\n\n<strong>Featured contributions </strong>(in no particular order):\n\n<div style=\"display:block;margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/VictorMarkedge_final1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-772\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/VictorMarkedge_final1.jpg\" title=\"Print\"></a>\n\nby Victor Mark\n\n</div>\n\n<strong>Description:</strong> <em>The logo represents walking the edge between two worlds, the old and the new.

The first group of edgeryders is in Matera as I write this: [havartu], [Matthias], [Bembo Davies], [pacheca], [Noemi], [Rita O]... the list gets longer by the hour. <strong>Living On The Edge \u2013 the unPilgrimage is actually happening</strong>.\u00a0\n\nI am superhappy, and very much looking forward to it. I am also a little spooked: <strong>we built together this thing from the ground up over the last four months, working together with no budget, no command structure and in many cases without having ever met before</strong>. Please, take a moment to consider the awesomeness of this, and let it hit home.\n\n<strong>What happened is essentially this: we went out and said \"ok, let's do this. We have nothing to offer except ourselves\"</strong>. From then on, the whole event crystallized as if by magic around this initial commitment. The lovely Matera 2019 folks offered a venue; people came out of the woodwork to propose sessions, offer hospitality, negotiate deals and scholarships, map cheap flights and long-distance buses for the benefit of budget travellers. A <a href=\"/t/title-missing/2037\">program</a> emerged, alongside with a welcome and hosting committee, a range of services including conference wi-fi, graphic materials and even physical activities such as morning yoga for unPilgrims. At some point along the way, the people of Matera began to treat LOTE3 as a venue to meet up and discuss what they are interested in doing, sharing it with friendly strangers from all over the world. I am especially looking forward to the meeting of the Edgeryders community with that of Matera 2019, working locally to make their city the European City of Culture in 2019 (see, it's even got <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-vs-mt2019-flyer/2089\">its own flyer!</a>). Soon, action was being planned alongside talk, like in the <a href=\"/t/pasta-party/1839\">Pasta Party </a>(where we all, led by Materan cooking lore, make, cook and eat our own pasta), and in a <a href=\"/t/guerrilla-knitting/1860\">guerrilla knitting attack</a> (where we all cover a bridge in knitwork \u2013 wait, did I really just write \"cover a bridge in knitwork\"? ). As we worked, we improved our way of working by inventing new formats for collaboration, like the super-successful weekly <a href=\"/t/fast-forward-through-community-calls/1222\">community calls</a> and the <a href=\"/t/why-be-proud-of-the-twitterstorm-where-does-it-all-go/2048\">Twitterstorm</a>.\n\nI was involved from the very start, and still find it hard to wrap my head around it. I stood in the midst of it all and watched this strange, beautiful thing grow around me and get more complex and multifaceted by the day. I like to think I understand social dynamics leading to collective intelligence and all, but actually seeing it happen is an experience I will never forget. Each and every post, comment, tweet, phone call, design work, hour spent traveling has been a gift from one of us to all of us. <strong>The overall result is this: we have organized a killer conference without any organization</strong>. We have not bought it as a service, because we did not have any money. We built it ourselves. We own it in a way that normal people going to normal conferences never will. Plus, we have done this with incredible efficiency, getting a lot of mileage out of very little and even enjoying the luxury of not having to scramble at the last minute, because guess what? organizations break down, but <em>we are a network</em>, and networks simply re-route activities around the point of failure and carry on. This is common good production on an amazing scale, people. I am incredibly proud of us, and humbled by the generosity shown by each and every person: thank you all, from the deepest of my heart. And that includes all that will not make it to Matera, but helped in many ways those of us who will.\u00a0\n\nWhatever happens in Matera, we have made it this far.

The life of an activist is not easy, and I wish there was an activist manual (as suggested by Arthur Doohan's excellent mission report).

If each human being cared about climate, I think that it would make wonders. So don't give up on your dreams. Continue to care, and continue to look for your place under the sun. When the frustration gets too high, yell. I do a lot of yelling in my car, you know. It feels good and it releases frustration. Usually, after I've protested by yelling demonstrations (to Life), I receive answers, or an opportunity shows up.

They hadn't changed how the business was run, they just changed how they counted the\u00a0 money as turnover.\n\nIt meant that they were making it explicit about how their customers had been ripped off, while it was a monolithic state-run enterprise, but they didn't change anything, except the pockets that the money was going to. Now they were a monolithic private enterprise. With a physical monopoly on the existing telecoms infrastructuire of the UK....\n\nIt's been improving, but the local ISP's and co-operative ISP's have had to fight tooth and nail to get BT to provide the services that they've been contracted to do. In terms of exchange access which BT are legally required to provide, in terms of rural digital exchange upgrades, and in many other ways, BT have been dragging their heels about letting other players into the market.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an engineer and techie, i'm more interested in efficient solutions than most people.\n\nAs someone who worked in the music biz, i'm always looking for the ways that people can be ripped off, because if you don't have all of the loopholes nailed shut, then it WILL happen.\n\nAnd don't get me started about Hollywood accounting...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote, i didn't say anything about how the co-operative was going to be RUN, i was only saying that they need explicit clauses about how it should be OWNED.\n\nI've seen the studies from China that showed when it was a state-run model, you got lots of free-riders, who didn't put their share of the work in, because they weren't directly benefiting, both on the ground doing the labour, and higher up the hierarchy.\n\nIt was only when the peasants were able to sell direct to the market and profit for themselves, that the state farming enterprises were able to function effectively.\n\nThat was the real secret behind\u00a0the economic miracles of Hunan and Shenzen.\n\nHarnessing people's inherent self-interest efficiently.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat i was trying to create was a rule-set that would mean that the longer-term self-interest, would win out over the short-term quick buck.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere was one attempt to try and privatise a housing co-op, while one friend was living there. To paraphrase what he said at that particular meeting. \"Yes, we could realise a quick profit by moving out and selling the buildings, but if we still wanted to live in London, we'd end up paying commercial rents. The share of the money that we'd each get, would cover one year's commercial rent. Which is why we have the minimum length of membership being one year.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt doesn't mean that i'm approaching the idea of co-operatives dogmatically as an ideology. Here in the UK, the simplest and quickest way to start a co-operative, is to use a limited company as a legal structure, with rules that set it up so it behaves according to the co-operative principles.\n\nI just want to have explicit guarantees built-in from the start, so that they can avoid the routes to fraud that have already taken place.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo misquote Kim Stanley Robinson, \"Do you want real change, or do you want business-as-usual with a different set of faces in charge?\"\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-27 16:45:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.317413", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 672, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22891], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4824, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 4791, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Ok all,\n\nthanks again for your careful reading and suggestions, I will take care of integrating these in the final document.\n\nI've discussed with Marianne Fonteyne earlier today, and I now have a better understanding of the process.\n\n-- I will submit the GA documents (part A + part B) Friday at the latest.

The global informational era has tumbled down the one dimension social paradigm that structured or characterised post-war Europe. Especially now in times of economic crisis, with austerity measures and a retrenchment of the welfare state, what YOU CAN DO matters more than ever.\n\n<u>Confronting the academia with reality</u>\n\nFor young people University should not be mere a place of intellectual torment. Conversely, it should be an environment stacked with opportunities at every step in terms of skills development.\n\nInternationalising education matters as it makes a statement. You prove to yourself (1) <em>adaptability, </em>(2)<em> resilience</em> and (3) <em>maturity</em> by willingly making a step away from a comfortable life at home. \u00a0So, be bold and go study abroad or take a semester in another country for it will pay in return through more than just a degree.\n\nPeople like to imagine themselves working for multinational companies and travelling as part of their jobs. Others wish to shape the world, work at the UN or in the diplomatic service. In either cases acquiring (4) <em>cultural awareness</em>, i.e. understanding other cultures, and (5) <em>cultural marketing</em>, successfully promoting you own, are of paramount importance if you wish to avoid 'civilizational clashes'. One of the assets which will get you the desired position anywhere on the globe is demonstrating intimate knowledge with the respective cultural background. Another asset represents (6) the <em>foreign languages</em> \u2013the sky\u2019s the limit here \u2013 you know, after all, you do need a means of communication with the others.\n\nSo, pick a cosmopolitan university and the rest will unfold by itself.\n\n<u>Degree skills</u>\n\nMost people fall into the trap of translating faculties into grades and acquired knowledge. Remove hierarchy from your vocabulary and substitute with <u>network</u>. You don\u2019t need to dig yourself a trench into one specialised filed. Contrarily, gain as much knowledge from different domains and make career changes when you feel like it, otherwise you might be arbitrarily forced to do so. All degrees develop (7) <em>transferable skills</em> such as critical or logical thinking, the capacity to synthesise information and so\u00a0forth that can help you make a transition.\n\n<u>Must haves</u>\n\n(8) <em>Time-management</em>, (9)<em> communication </em>and (10)<em> teamwork </em>skills are the bottom line in any job, but they\u2019re all basic things we\u2019ve been developing since we first entered primary school. The whole trick is to be aware of them and eloquently illustrate them, regardless if it\u2019s for a job or yourself.\n\nTherefore, to conclude, if you ever need a reality check and fell put off by not knowing what you can do, take a pause and think it through, it\u2019s much easier than it looks.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-04 15:10:57", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 17:15:37.396102", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 516, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22034, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 4843, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>LOTE5</b>\n\nYes it is my plan to come.\u00a0 Very much looking forward to it.\n\nI looked at FuckUp Nights awhile back - very cool project.\u00a0 I have certainly had my share of them, although not all in a business sense..\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-16 21:14:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.780085", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 2.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20415], "is_liked_by": [2201, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20656, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2065, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>hold the press</b>\n\nNoemi \u00a0thanks for this welcome encouragement.\n\nBen and I are tweaking the Track 2 program at this moment. \u00a0Will you accept revisions in 20 minutes time?\n\nBembo\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-23 10:14:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.994438", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33085, "user_id": 1672, "topic_id": 2308, "post_number": 31, "raw": "<b>Upload Icons</b>\n\nHi there,\n\nI uploaded the altered icons into\u00a0https://github.com/edgeryders/unmonastery-graphics account have a look I like some feedback :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-21 01:40:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.579916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8438, "user_id": 3664, "topic_id": 805, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I am out of words to explain how amazing the idea is.

Everyone seems to favour a co-produced session over a fixed teacher pupil relationship. Reflecting on LOTE1, I was reminded of the session Smari suggested 'can the internet build big things' \u2013 a lot of people turned up, Smari didn't have anything other than the title to structure the session - but it turned into one of most fruitful sessions\n\nIn recognising the potential for the high density of smart, capable and willing people planning on attending LOTE3, it seems logical to me to lay out some of the fundamental questions and building blocks that have yet to be built for the unMonastery in the form of skeletal session proposals, for others to run with. I'm not proposing to run or facilitate each and every one of these, what I'm suggesting is there are very able facilitators within the community that have the desire to contribute to the project, this is the most straightforward way in which I can imagine this happening.\n\nHopefully by merging the conversations that have been happening around unMonastery into a series of potential sessions, there will be sufficient appetite for developing each of them further prior to the conference.\n\nBecause conversation is often easier than delivering quantifiable outcomes, I've laid out a provisional structure of each session, which goes something like this:\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tOutline / Rationale.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tKey Questions the session seeks to answer.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tReference Points (existing projects and concepts that are relevant)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOutcomes (Actionables and real usable stuff)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tNeeds (What does the session require in order to happen)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tIdeal Facilitator (Each session focuses on differing areas of expertise, thus a specialised knowledge base on the part of the facilitator can greatly improve the quality of the session)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b>Here's links to the sessions I've outlined and uploaded so far: </b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/future-thought-the-unmonasterys-200-year-trajectory\">Future Thought: The unMonastery's 200 year trajectory.</a>\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/juristiction-and-the-unrule\">Juristiction and the unRule</a>\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/infrastructural-implications-of-the-unmonastery\">Infrastructural implications of the unMonastery</a>\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/replicating-unmonastery-pattern-languages-and-unmonastery-in-a-box\">Replicating unMonastery: Pattern languages and unMonastery in-a-box</a>\n\nWhat can unMonastery learn from the ancient past?

The movement arrived from Rochdale. Before then, except for some exceptions, rural life was based in individuality. Cooperation, on the one hand, allowed rural communities to survive. On the other hand, communities generated a democratic methodology to decide. In spite of that, things have not been so nice. Some people of each cooperative have had more power than others and democracy has not been so clear. In conclusion, even though there have been some successful episodes, crisis periods have been really difficult for rural areas in Catalonia. At the end, cooperation, as it has been applied, has not been the final solution.\n\n\n## ICT4RD, another opportunity for rural community\n\nNowadays, when I go to rural areas to speak about how ITC could improve rural life, everybody mentions collaboration. My research, in fact, focuses on how that process is possible thanks to ITC. Technology allows collaboration, linking interests, as Network Society works. For that reason, I guess rural areas have another opportunity in Catalonia, at least, to work in a different way, far from individuality. Despite that, the results of my first investigation were not good enough. Individual producers, in general, are using better ITC to improve the way they launch their products in market than traditional communities. However, that would not be strange if the communities did not work well. But there are some good reasons to believe things could be improved:\n\n1. Virtual communities have a new approach to participation. Maybe, that is closer to Rochdale facts than traditional cooperatives.\n\n2. Technologies are beating geographical gaps between rural and urban spaces.\n\n3. <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/\" title=\"Open Source Ecology\">Open Source Ecology</a> links <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab\" title=\"FabLab\">FabLab</a> concept to rural life. Farmers can make their own machines (by copying); even more, they can create (and share) their own discoveries.\n\n4. <a href=\"http://www.transitionnetwork.org/\" title=\"Transition Towns Network\">Transition Towns Network</a> shows another way to approach to consumption (sustainability or ecology, to name but two, are important values).\n\n5. Consumers want to control origin or business related with products they consume. (The People\u2019s Supermarket, for instance). That urban community is willing to spend a few hours of their time and a little quantity of money so as to know product origin and marketing benefits.", "created_at": "2012-06-08 08:09:39", "updated_at": "2018-11-02 17:40:42.308017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13297, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2528, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>We don't mean to create problems! </b>\n\nHello Christina \u2013 whatever works.

There is a reason why so many anarchist theories begin by saying \"education, education, education\", that being that in order to create a fair society of free individuals one must teach them to be critical and to want to be free. But for me, education is not brainwashing. Every society uses education to introduce the values it considers valid in children, and every society will do that forever. Thus, we are all \"brainwashed from birth\", here in Europe, in North Korea, in Japan and everywhere else. And in a sense we will always be brainwashed in this sense, as it is utterly impossible to live in a society and not be permeated by its values to a certain extent.\n\nSince I consider work an important part of my life, defining work as the old Marxist definition of your time dedicated to doing something productive, but employment utterly unimportant (employment being the exploitation of your work potential to create surplus for someone else), and I don't follow set timed structures (I have no idea if I would relate to the 8-4-4-4 schema you present, 4 hours of family life is a downright scary prospecrt for me), I think I'll go for freedom here. You, and everyone else, should be allowed to do whatever the damn they please with their lives. That is, in a society with some critical thinking, real freedom. The social covenant we live in does give us choices and yes, they are mostly cosmetic (please choose the right or the left path to reach exactly the same place), but here the main problem is still education. Most of us have not been educated to question the status quo and to think it unmovable (the current crisis scare climate would be a laughable example of \"society destroyed by its economy, nothing we can do\" if it wasn't so clearly becoming an actuality).\u00a0\n\nSo, to wrap things up, yes, I do think change is possible, but it will be at best generational. Any intent of change within ourselves will be biased by the society we grew in, and thus ultimately insufficient. In order to carry out the change you propose, we'd need these -so to say- \"deprogrammed\" people to become in their majority school teachers, and with a bit of luck in a couple generations we could achieve a fairer society. That, of course, will seem insufficient to all those that want the revolution overnight, but hey, nobody said life was fair.\n\nAgain, that's how I think that works, maybe collapsonomists have already developed a protocol to change the human being overnight.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-30 06:44:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.597476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 524, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20481], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28311, "user_id": 2321, "topic_id": 3352, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Meeting in Matera</b>\n\nHi Natalia,\n\nyes I do speak Italian, actually I am from Italy!

I am left with at least one practical note and one more theoretical one.\u00a0\n\nThe practical note is of most relevance to the present discussion. Let's agree we don't want transactional logic to penetrate everything in Edgeryders. Start by positing one edgeryder \u2013 call \u00a0her Alice \u2013\u00a0with a project, for example organizing a physical meetup. Suppose the person actually has a client, and a little money. There are two ways that she could compensate individual edgeryders helping out:\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>nonmonetary kudos</strong> (for small things such as resharing, retweeting etc. to put the word out)</li>\n\n<li><strong>material compensation</strong> (for larger quanta of work that entail taking responsibility, for example being the floor manager for the event).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nEconomy App can track case 1 by \"thank you vouchers\", as you suggest. But there is a catch: such vouchers need to be denominated in currency. And time is the one thing most of us are very careful not to underprice. So, it looks like this: I donate, say, one day of my time to Alice's project. It's a real donation: I don't expect to be paid. But numeraire means I have to track, and put a price tag on it. I am a freelance consultant, and\u00a0consider myself a pretty senior one. One day of billable time\u00a0goes for, what? At least 500 euro. Of course this is not the way my time is normally sold: I typically work with retainers, in which I sell \u00a0a package of days over a year or so, at a heavily discounted rate, by I am not comfortable putting my own price in at less than 500 euro a day. After all, this is how I make my living: it is my privilege to fix my own price, I don't want any client telling me \"Hey, I saw you working for 100 euro a day that time on Edgeryders!\". You know how freelancers like to say \"work for a lot of money, or for free, but never for cheap\"?\u00a0\n\nProblem is, at this point Alice is looking at a 500 euro gift. If collaboration works, there are probably many more people like me. It is very easy to pile up thousands or tens of thousands of euro as \"sweat donations\". What is the psychological impact of putting a price tag onto it? It could be negative: the poor Alice is overwhelmed by running, say a 10K euro operation on 10K euro of gifts. Even though we are explicitly making donations, she feels in debt. On the other hand, it could also be positive: she could turn onto her client and tell him \"look! for 10K euro, you got 20K euro worth of high quality labor, as my community found the work was worth doing and put in 10K worth of work as a gift. This is the magic you get if you do good work and do it with me and the Edgeryders community. It is the premium for meaningfulness of what we do\". What do people think here?\n\nAs for case 2, material compensation, on Edgeryders, could certainly take the shape of barter. But I am guessing cash would work better in most cases! Let's stay with our example: Alice wants Bob to take responsibility for floor management doing the event. Maybe both Alice and Bob are using Economy App and could seal a network barter deal, but this particular economy is not liquidity constrained, because Alice\u00a0<em>does</em> have a client and some money: so, the Economy App's comparative advantage is not there. Also, there is a tax issue: at this point, Alice has an incentive to get an invoice from Bob. Paying an invoice with a mountain bike is not illegal, but there is a chance that the tax authority will come looking if you have an invoice and no bank transfer to show for it.\u00a0\n\nConclusion: whan you move the Economy App from a local context, you lose the ease of \"Alice, who has a bike, wants Bob's skis;\u00a0Bob wants Charlie's drawing table; Charlie wants a bike\". While quanta of labor help close barter deals of material things, when labor is the main thing being exchanged the system seems to lose some of its edge with respect to a dual system made of gifts and monetary compensation of labor.\u00a0\n\nAnd here's my little bit of theory: I think you misunderstood a key part of Ostrom. The clear boundaries between who has access and who does not have it are an\u00a0<em>outcome</em> of a functioning commons management institution. The a priori of common goods is that they are non-excludable: in fact, non-excludability coupled with rivalry in consumption is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good_(economics)\">the\u00a0very definition</a> of common goods.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-26 11:41:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.311297", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 852, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11443], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19279, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5030, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Spreadsheet please!</b>\n\nThis enables us to send a customised template quickly today.

We start at 9:00 on both days.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>PROGRAM</h2>\n\n<strong>What happens on Day 1?</strong>For some years now the Council of Europe has been active in local deliberative processes involving diverse stakeholders and is currently building a network of European cities which sign the Charter of Shared Responsibilities as a commitment to engage with their citizens to help implement projects that contribute to increasing well being in societies.\n\nWe start with a facilitated discussion on how can interests and incentives be aligned for projects in diverse corners of Europe to be noticed and augmented so that they reach maximum potential in terms of: 1) reducing social exclusion, inequalities and poverty and 2) in doing so using highly deliberative and inclusive processes. Participants will then split in smaller groups to get to know people in the room, to explore what resources we actually have in the community, who is doing what and how we can support each other's projects. (Collaboration Mosaic).\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/local-action-heroes\">Discuss this challenge with other participants!</a>\n\n<strong>What happens on Day 2?</strong> This session is meant as a prototype of citizen collaboration that takes on board the full complexity of designing policy, rather than a dumbed-down version. Parallel sessions are formed. Each one focuses on one of the policy recommendations that were a result of Edgeryders. A member of the community takes responsibility for facilitating each one; an invited guest from the policy world acts as expert-in-residence. Each sessions tries to hammer out a \u201chow-to\u201d to make its goal achievable, focusing on the nuts-and-bolts of policy making to dodge hidden traps, legal incompatibilities, financial restrictions and the like. At the end, each session presents its approach and main findings. Here is a provisional list of topics, facilitators, and guests:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Rewiring innovation policy. Facilitators: Kat Borlongan and Philippe Verstichel.  Expert-in-residence: Prabhat Agarwal, European Commission \u2013 DG Connect</li>\n\n<li>Supporting bottom-up social infrastructures that regenerate human potential. Facilitators: Ilaria D\u2019Auria and Vinay Gupta. Expert-in-residence: Justyna Krol, UNDP</li>\n\n<li>Cracking the unpaid internships enigma. Facilitators: Charanya Chimbaradam Expert-in-residence: (t.b.c)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/policy-heroes\">Discuss this challenge with other participants!</a>\n\n<strong>\n\n</strong>\n\n<strong>What happens on Day 3-4? </strong>You want to do something,but don\u2019t have money? In Edgeryders you have a network of international collaborators who could help you do the work, and vice versa,  if the community were developed to facilitate and support this. We want to leave \\#lote2 with a working prototype of a new project which 1000s of people from all over the world are going to actively help one another get something started and keep it going to affect positive change in our local environments.\n\n<strong>What\u2019s happening?</strong> Join the EdgeRyders team, and 100 of your new friends from all over Europe in a two day peer-to-peer open format unconference where people will present their own projects, find collaborators and friends, and get a chance to meet and spend time with all the people they have met during the EdgeRyders activities.

Coupons are backed by time, and there is no such thing as \"fiat time\". So, whereas a financial system based on money can just expand at will, one based on time cannot. In the real world, we constantly experience inability to buy time, not because the price is not right but because the supply is so limited. You are a case in point yourself: Edgeryders would love to buy more of your time, but you just would not sell it to us. This is no threat to Pay Coupons, but on a theoretical level I wonder if it could ever be an economy-wide system, or if it can only live in niches.\n\nIt seems that this a system that works in practice better than it does in theory.

D'abord, j'en ai trouv\u00e9 dans des livres. Cette discussion avec Michel Filippi a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s formatrice pour moi. Cependant, ce n'\u00e9tait pas encore une communaut\u00e9 de personnes avec la Kundalini. Au mois de mars, j'ai d\u00e9couvert l'Institute for Consciousness Research. J'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9diter leur compte Twitter peu de temps apr\u00e8s, et l\u00e0, je croise beaucoup de gens qui vivent avec le processus.\n\nIl y en a parmi eux qui sont plus avanc\u00e9s que moi dans leur d\u00e9veloppement, mais je parviens \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre tous les jours aux nombreuses questions des utilisateurs. Moi qui ne me croyais pas si \u00e9clair\u00e9e sur le sujet, je me rends compte maintenant que je saisis pas mal de choses, que la plupart ne voient pas. \n\nJe m'\u00e9tais r\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00e0 ne pas associer mes nouvelles activit\u00e9s quotidiennes avec Edgeryders, car il ne semblait pas y avoir d'autres participants qui comprennent de quoi il s'agit.\n\nCela me fait plaisir de pouvoir discuter avec d'autres participants de ces questions. Je connais maintenant des gens avec la Kundalini qui habitent en Californie, Washington et New York, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, en Ontario et Qu\u00e9bec au Canada, au Royaume-Uni, en Italie, au Mexique et en Argentine. La communaut\u00e9 s'agrandit un peu plus chaque semaine. \n\nJe ne suis plus seule. Il y en a plein d'autres comme moi. C'est un sentiment extraordinaire que de pouvoir croiser ces gens tous les jours. De pouvoir leur dire \u00e0 mon tour qu'ils ne sont pas seuls. De les aider \u00e0 comprendre ce qu'il leur arrive. \n\nIl en arrive de partout. Chaque jour, ICR gagne une centaine de nouveaux followers. Le compte Twitter se d\u00e9veloppe \u00e0 une vitesse fulgurante. \n\nJe ne pense pas que les gouvernements se rendent compte que les citoyens se transforment, qu'ils sont en train de muter en une autre forme, qui leur conf\u00e8re une vision alt\u00e9r\u00e9e du monde. D'abord cette vision se d\u00e9veloppe \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur puis s'\u00e9tend aux r\u00eaves, et finit par modifier la vue et m\u00eame l'ouie. \n\nIl y en a qui pourraient penser que tout cela ne sert \u00e0 rien. Mais ce n'est pas le cas. Ces transformations, ces modifications \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle, nous conduisent vers l'\u00e9volution humaine. Cela n'aurait pas pu \u00eatre observable il y a quelques ann\u00e9es. Mais gr\u00e2ce aux m\u00e9dias sociaux, nous pouvons avoir un meilleur aper\u00e7u. Avec une base de donn\u00e9es rassemblant les exp\u00e9riences mystiques, il y aurait une vision encore plus precise, les utilisateurs pourraient \u00e9changer entre eux, la cueillette de donn\u00e9es aurait lieu, des chercheurs pourraient analyser et \u00e9tudier les donn\u00e9es, des s\u00e9quen\u00e7ages d'ADN apporteraient des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 nos questions. \n\nEn quelques mois, je suis devenue rapidement la co-leader mondiale de cette communaut\u00e9.

I remembered attending the various <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/0/38785/Arts--Culture/0/A-year-of-ElFan-Midan-in-Egypt.aspx\">Al-Fan Midan</a> festivals here, monthly music carnivals first launched two months after the fall of Hosni Mubarak and held until September 2014. Now, a construction crew was trimming the grass and laying a concrete path as part of an <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/WriterArticles/NewsContentP/1/132029/Egypt/Renovating-Cairos-Downtown-Contested-visions-of-th.aspx\">ambitious state-sponsored plan</a> to renovate downtown Cairo headed by the Cairo governorate. As my memories subsided, I hailed a cab to travel the last mile to Ibn Toloun mosque, wherefrom I planned to walk to Megawra. \n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/077812832d3ea5425e9572859cae492a942c3f0f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\"><br>\n\nMegawra had recently moved to the al-Khalifa region in Old Cairo, a historic pocket of domes and shrines for the family of the Prophet Muhammad within wider Islamic Cairo. I entered the al-Khalifa Community Centre to meet with Dr. May al Ibrashy, who set out to explain to me what Megawra was about.  \n\nAfter years working as an architect and later as an architecture professor, May had started MEGAWRA as a means to promote discussions &amp; cultural programming on the social &amp; creative aspects of architecture outside the confines of university education. Her educational background lies in architecture and conservation. In <a href=\"http://www.egyptindependent.com/megawra-brings-cairos-young-architects-together/\">February 2012</a>, the initiative moved to an office located in the Ard al-Golf area of up-scale Heliopolis. MEGAWRA started there as a co-working space with a library, an exhibition space and a lecture space. It <a href=\"http://megawra.com/about/\">describes itself</a> as a \u201cplatform for holistic debate on the field of architecture and urbanism with a focus on it as art, theory, praxis and cultural heritage and its role in promoting sustainability and social responsibility in the built environment.\u201d It moved to al-Khalifa in 2014. \n\nOrganisationally, MEGAWRA the cultural space is part of a wider structure. It is operated by  the Built Environment Collective, an Egyptian NGO registered in 2011 to manage some of the spaces\u2019 activities, and the al-Khalifa Community Service centre. The lowercase <a href=\"http://megawra.com/residency/\">Megawra Consult</a> is an architectural firm established by May in 2014. It provides MEGAWRA with technical assistance, while handling tenders and professional consultancy and conservation projects. The scope of MEGAWRA also includes various projects and partnerships with their own unique names, such as <a href=\"http://atharlina.com/en\">Athar Lina</a>, a participatory conservation initiative. Or the <a href=\"http://megawra.com/research/\">Ain Shams Neighbourhood Initiative</a>, a research and development programme run by the University of Ain Shams.\n\nIn 2012 May secured funding from the Danish Egyptian Institute to start a research project in the al-Khalifa area. al-Khalifa street is one of the richest streets in Islamic Cairo in terms of the age of its heritage sites and their respective religious significance: The Shajar Al-Durr Dome, Mashhad of al-Sayyida Ruqayya, and the shrines of Atika and Ja'fri. Athar Lina, as the project is called, translates into the `monuments are ours`, and the first phase consisted of multiple workshops and discussions surrounding the theme of ownership and utilisation of monuments.\n\n \n\nA common theme was identified: Most Islamic monuments are neglected and actually a menace of sorts to their communities. Overly protective heritage preservation laws prevent the community from interacting or using the monuments and carry harm in form of increasingly strict zoning, parking and adjacent construction limitations. This in turn turns the areas directly surrounding monuments into a `No Man\u2019s land`; historic monuments eventually turn into garbage collection points. Such was the case with Shajar al-Durr Dome, a square-shaped burial mausoleum named after the Sultana of Egypt in the 13th century who played a crucial role in defeating the Seventh Crusade. \n\n \n\nThis first round of talk was followed by action. The second iteration of Athar Lina launched the Athar Lina School of Art and Heritage; a series of sessions around raising heritage awareness through drama, art and craft lessons. The third iteration saw the rehabilitation of the Shajar al-Durr Dome and its adjacent building; which eventually turned into the al-Khalifa Community Service centre. It is here that MEGAWRA moved to from its original Heliopolis office. \n\nThe move has many benefits: It cements the centre\u2019s dedication to heritage conservation and care-taking through its presence; interaction with the community is institutionalised through buying up supplies locally and working side-by-side to the community served. Trust in the centre is established; while the centre gains an understanding of local dynamics. A vital component in a community used to regular rhetoric of unfilled development and restoration promises.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8df7fabd2a3e630f741c0a24d3b0a62d429e0161.jpg\" width=\"374\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nAl-Khalifa Community Service centre building ownership status is unclear. The building was constructed in the 1920\u2019s as an unfinished mosque. It was converted to a community health center and operated until its closure sometime in the 1990\u2019s; it remained closed ever since. \n\nThe keys to the building were with a nurse as ownership was shared between a clinic and a traditional tent rental business, called Farrash, who used half the space as storage. The business owner claimed his grandfather to have built the mosque back in the day; a historical cross-reference revealed that his grandfather had been the contractor of the 19th century building previously occupying the space to be which was replaced  by the current unfinished mosque in the 20th  century. \n\nThe custodian did not possess formal ownership papers of the building which he used as a storage space over the last years. He offered to and actually vacated the premises when confronted with a request by Megawra, and their desire to refurbish and re-open the space.\n\nToday, the centre is run jointly by the aforementioned Built Environment Collective NGO and a committee of local community residents. With the space established, the centre started to experiment with different models of utilising the space for the communities benefit: \n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Could the Athar Lina School of Art and Heritage Project be revived and contribute to community education?</li>\n\n<li>Can the al-Khalifa street realize its touristic potential through awareness campaigns documenting its rich heritage?</li>\n\n<li>Can a sustainable solution to the areas waste problem be found and implemented?</li>\n\n<li>Can it contribute to community health?</li>\n\n<li>Can it support local knowledge exchange?  </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\"I find these experiments to be the most valuable learning resource\" May said. Conservation is a costly affair, and naturally grant-dependant. No mechanisms for adaptive re-use of conserved heritage sites exist in Egypt, making self-sustained conservation a legal impossibility. As the al-Khalifa Community Service centre is not officially listed as a monument, it escapes these limitations.  And it thus serves as an example for alternate modes of working, and the importance in ownership for successful projects. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Education</h3>\n\nToday, the restored al-Khalifa Community Service centre is a safe haven for children. Previously an off-limits space surrounded by garbage, it is now open all daily for children of the community to gather and spend time in. May believes this to give the children a sense of connection to their monuments from an early age; the binding of the all-so precious childhood memories to heritage. A concept that had gradually been lost trough time. The centre also hosts daily summer classes and biweekly winter classes with the Athar Lina team teaching heritage, art, crafts, Quran, reading, writing and sports. Most classes are hosted by volunteers, a mix drawn from the community as well as from the wider MEGAWRA network.  \n\nCurrently, the school is relying on an innovative model for funding its activities. It offers paid guided tours to the al-Khalifa area, including surrounding monuments such as the Ibn-Toulon and the Gayer Anderson museum, to international schools based in Cairo. These International schools host students from wealthier parents, who can afford paying a fee in exchange for these one-day field trips. May calculates that organizing ten such field-trips would cover all material and operation costs for the al-Khalifa summer school for one season. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><span>Tourism </span></h3>\n\nThe al-Khalifa Community Service centre hosts regular city walks, organised walks in the al-Khalifa street which stop by all monuments and heritage sites within the area. This generates some foot-traffic to the area and tests the waters for utilising the touristic potential of the al-Khalifa street. \n\nYet, the rather dilapidated infrastructure situation leaves venturing to al-Khalifa a niche visit for tourists in the present time.  An ongoing <a href=\"http://www.zoomaal.com/projects/dayinkhalifa?ref=31225433\">crowd-funding campaign</a> hopes to raise funds to support the wider activities of the al-Khalifa Community Service centre. \n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/328cf976d450bbfecd6d2dd06b50bec2058efed1.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><a href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8df7fabd2a3e630f741c0a24d3b0a62d429e0161.jpg\">Health</a></h3>\n\nA main purpose to restoring the al-Khalifa Community Service centre was for it to regain the former status as a community health centre it enjoyed up till the 1990\u2019s. Originally, a donor was found who promised to fund a salaried General Practitioner to regularly hold visitation times in a specially renovated medical room within the centre. Yet, this particular experience failed after just 4 months. The primary problem lies in the doctor coming from outside the al-Khalifa community: Issues arose around the fixed visitation times and different time perceptions of the Doctor compared to the al-Khalifa residents. Visiting during a pre-specified 4 hour window is not compatible with the perception of time amongst al-Khalifa residents, who are more flexibly minded. Trust could not be established with the Dr., whose visitation days soon went patient-less. \n\nTwo problems persist: First, the low socio-economic classification of the al-Khalifa area means that there are no local doctors who could man the health unit. Relying on doctors from outside al-khalifa is a practical necessity. Second, it is difficult to create an economically sustainable perpetual funding model. Token visitation fees collected in the previous experiment cover only a fraction of total costs; and raising them to market-prices would deter all demand for the health unit. Currently, the Medical room sits unused until a more suitable model can be implemented. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Knowledge Exchange</h3>\n\nIn perhaps the most interesting activity within the al-Khalifa centre, around 20 participants from an architectural background (academic &amp; applied) come together every Friday for 4 months with 3 local al-Khalifa carpenters to exchange knowledge and practical skills. There is no fixed curriculum, rather participants decide collaboratively on what to learn. For many of the architects, this presented the first opportunity to work directly with wood. The activity is completely self-funded by token fees collected from participants at the beginning of the programme to cover material costs; the carpenters allow access to their tools and workshops. \n\nAs the programme progressed, around half of the architects dropped out, as well as 2 of the 3 carpenters. Failure to maintain the weekly time commitment is cited as the primary reason. The entire programme and its administration is now handled completely by the remaining carpenter, Sayyid Atallah. Sayyid is now preparing the second iteration of the Khalifa Exchange, as it is called. \n\nI had met Sayyid 2 years ago in a round-table discussion of how to revive the Darb al-Labbana area. Darb al-Labbana lies at the south-western fringe of Historic Cairo under the Citadel, a medieval islamic fortification originally built by Salah al-Din in the 12th century, and is another hotspot of concentrated islamic heritage sites: It lies next to the Madrasa of Sultan Hassan and the al-Mosque of Rifa'i, both major visitor-attractions. It includes more than 10 registered historic monuments such as a 15th century hospital, Sufi complex and multiple 18th century residential structures with outstanding architectural ornaments. \n\nWith the government preoccupied with maximising revenue from historic sites, such a place does not really exist in Cairo. The Cairo governorate has no vision or plan for Historic Cairo. There exists no institution tasked with the improvement of Historic Cairo. This lack of vision is reflected in long-declining numbers for cultural tourism, where it is now estimated to contribute no more than 6% of touristic activity. \n\nBack then, an architect come business entrepreneur had grand dreams of developing such under-utilised areas, and surrounded himself with like-minded youths. Sayyed, who was born in the area surrounding al-Khalifa, was drawn by a deep desire to work for his community. He had a decade of experience working in carpentry, and a stable income stream therefrom. Yet, the dilapidated state of his physical surroundings left him yearning for more. He started attending meetings, and eventually took part in a workshop sponsored by Athar Lina, and thus came across May, MEGAWRA and the al-Khalifa Community Service centre. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Reflection</h3>\n\nAs I left the al-Khalifa area, I started comparing the restoration of the al-Khalifa Community Service centre with the restoration of the Abdeen Gardens. Both represent two different approaches: The bottom up approach of May lies in stark contrast to the Cairo Governorate led project. The al-Khalifa Community Service centre is slowly amassing more and more community members in its activities, such as carpenter Sayyed Attallah, and is pursuing activities that are at their heart people-centric. Abdeen Gardens meanwhile are a potent symbol of the states\u2019 pursuit of beautification, a policy born out of rejection of the dilapidated state of most of the cities infrastructure. Yet, implementing the policy coincided with the decline, and eventual ban, of the Al-Fin al Midan festival. The same questions Megawra hopes to discuss posed themselves: Who owns these public places, be they monuments or gardens? Who protects them? Who improves them? Who puts them at risk? \n\nI wondered wether Sayyed could ever be part of the downtown Cairo revival project the way he became part of the al-Khalifa Community Service centre. \n\n<em>Edit 1: Incorporated some detail changes suggested by the Interviewee.</em>", "created_at": "2017-08-01 22:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-04-27 07:54:18.005222", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2486, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 1029.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 2565, 3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32440, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 2051, "post_number": 53, "raw": "<b>Fine with me, 22.30h!</b>\n\nTiago and Caroline,\n\nFine with me, 22.30h!\n\nMeet you on hangout usual link.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-22 16:05:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.222260", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32439], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 856, "user_id": 3681, "topic_id": 823, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Believe in human nature or not!\n\nA few years back I saw a movie with Kevin Spacy, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment, \u201cPay it Forward\u201d. The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\n\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\n\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\n\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\n\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down. That insignificant gesture of kindness might have saved his life and of other people who might have reacted the same way to him or with fear. Or for just ignoring him.\n\nThis is a project that we would love to see in practice really soon and maybe in this activity that you are organizing we might meet the right people or find the proper way to do it. Maybe this would be something to introduce in the scholastic curricula!\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-30 22:25:12", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:30:17.899825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 828, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 940, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 907, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey Edgeryders, Alberto and Nadia are participating in different events around Europe.

For the younger generation who may have not had the presence of grandparents or the presence of older generations creating an influence in their life this is an added value for them, it connects the past, present and future in one conversation. Whether you\u2019re at either end of life- there are similarities.\u00a0\n\nThere are tremendous benefits of these connections. There is a lot of talk to help older people, but perhaps they can help the young. It's the experiences of life in a multigenerational, interdependent, abstract community that, more than anything else, teaches us how to be human. The older generation often is faced with isolation- which in turn creates the backdrop for cognitive decline. We all know that. If we can improve the standing of older adults in society, and nurture what they can bring through to the table, then we can achieve a better community with a better quality of life for all ages. With their practical knowledge, some may use the term wisdom, gained from experience, and because they carry with them a whole world lost to younger generation, they may well be our greatest social capital.

I like that definition. So in more prosaic form, it's seeing the opportunity to do something good, and doing it? And yes, there are ample opportunities within ourselves, and nobody can be a leader who has not gathered experience in working there. Here I agree. But then, there are also ample opportunities in the external world, also beyond the family and neighborhood.

People get to know the value of the group by this kind of exposure and are more likely to take active part in it.\n\nTo this end I always think of how speakers are urged to use humor to get the message across. Standup Comedy has two parts, the first part is 'standing up', the second, comedy. To engage people fully our grounding has to be firm, from there, the flow is important. The same applies when networking the networks. Understanding this is key. For the reason of\u00a0its being possible at all (which it is, being conceivable) this implies that the method of connecting the initial community is not directly content specific, what I mean is that its not the stuff but the stuff between the stuff that connects people and this is even more important in making that a creative arrangement. What becomes important is moreso the infrastructure, which is built on\u00a0values and information flows.\u00a0The success of the 'product', in network terms,\u00a0is not a product but the relation of a value associated to a purpose.\n\nGiven that 'meta-bullshit', as Petros would lovingly say ;) , there are some core things that we can start to do. I have mentioned the Centup and Flattr model (thanks Alberto for filling that gap), and how it can be used to generate funding circuits by rerouting 'donation'\u00a0funds through culture and the arts into societal change organizations and events. (You could even swing funding for this one , worded right, on a community basis)\n\nJasmine was working with Ele\u00a0on DIY days, Ele works as a writer for Good.is who umbrella Centup. Good.is have recently started a new venture called 'Goop Open' which could be a route in, and Centup itself just got donor funding enough to give a free dollar to a bunch people on the system to get them into it. (hence my thinking about the funding, I wrote to Good.is on behalf of ER before and they are open to future collaborations of this kind.)\u00a0The Good.is people have a large readership or their 'newsletter' which is populated by writers like Ele who are working on their own initiatives.\n\nThink about FastCo, people love it when they get in their newsletter/publication, this is another way to work it. Set that as your ultimate manifestation goal.\u00a0Make it a weekly featuring content from the community, not only original content but content that gets 'scooped'\u00a0from other sources. If you encourage this kind of behaviour: that people use the facebook page to publish articles promoting balance in\u00a0community awareness, and then if there is good stuff, you ask the poster to write a 5 - 10 sentence intro and scoop that for the weekly. As it grows, cultivate the partnerships with others working in the same way, share content and weave the communities further in this way.\n\nAnd thats in addition to the use of media, we need more digital video media. A\u00a0track at Lote might be developed just for this. Competing for attention is easier\u00a0if you make it accessible, engaging, informing, fun, and amazing. -\u00a0Leverage the Remix culture and the creative commons, the\u00a0digital video community, the streamers from activist circles. Its clear that the value structure in general is the same, the processes are the same, some have learned tricks others dont know yet, lets get these folk talking.\n\nIn this case then, with both digital video content, written content, collaborative content, you start to cultivate a community by reaching to their hearts as well as their minds, to the sense of community as to the individual sense.\n\nI know these are how-tos, but I figure it helps, I'm in a certain position as I am, I can only do what I can do and this is it. We need some who can see, others who can listen, others who can love, as many as possible those we trust...there are those who reflect and those who react, put them in the same room and you get the best possible outcome. This is not a prisoners dillema.\n\nBy the way, I reckon I'll be the far side of the pond during Lote, I'm up for contributing as I can, but things are taking me elsewhere physically at the moment. Just so ye know.\n\nAnd before I forget, this was published today:\u00a0<a href=\"http://crisisobs.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Opinion-Article_9_May-2013-Avramopoulos_Konstantinidis-ENG.pdf\">http://crisisobs.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Opinion-Article_9_May-2013-Avramopoulos_Konstantinidis-ENG.pdf\n\n\u00a0</a>Matthias, Alberto, Vinay, Doohan, Demsoc (Andrew right?)\u00a0and Asta might have a look at this for a possible track.

Platoniq have never believed in living off a service in Internet so they live off offline services through workshops, consultancy for social enterprises or cooperatives - develop tools on Internet and these tools bring them reputation and that is the base of the business which is giving services to public administrations, which is hard right now in Spain, and also to private entities.\n\nGoteo is the result of two years research on alternative economy models based on Internet - P2P credits, microcredits etc. Goteo is based on crowdfunding and crowdsourcing with open DNA, only helping projects to be founded if they have for example, open design, free software, open hardware etc concentrating on these new business models. More than crowdfunding it's more like micro credits which are paid back in the form of educational packages, code, design etc.\n\nOpen licensing is totally integrated in the Goteo platform so any project using it has these licenses right from the start. When a person helps a project through Goteo, they are helping to open up processes - an example is an <a href=\"http://www.goteo.org/project/zapatos-open-source\">open shoes project</a> which is not just about buying shoes but putting money to \"liberate\" parts of the process like the design so everyone can build their own shoes.\n\nPlatoniq always have two approaches, online and offline so Goteo was conceived without code at first and this influenced the final design. It was really co-designed with workshops and other processes - which means it has more features and is much richer than other \"similar\" platforms. This is the capital that Goteo brings with it and is also where the money comes from, from workshops not through the small percentage they get from the platform. The business model is selling services around it which is a common thing with many open practices.\n\n<strong>Sprints &amp; lemons</strong>\n\nThey moved from Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca in part because Susanne from the Platoniq team is originally from there and because it is nicer to live there. They have a garden where they produce their own tomatoes and lemons etc. and turn to the Internet when they need to know how to do something or share practices with other ecological producers. Before opening their new office they were spending half of what they spent in Barcelona, even though they had a free office there. Previously they were working with people full time in the Barcelona office but now they do sprints, coming together to work three days a month in a very focussed manner.\n\nThe crisis has produced a schizophrenic situation because there are lots of institutions that want Platoniq to help them develop participatory projects - they have less money than before and they think that participation will be cheaper and the users will provide the content. It's a big mistake they have to fight. 50% of money they make is from institutions so it has been affected a lot by the crisis - if before clients were taking a year to pay, now they are taking two. However they are doing more workshops as crowdfunding seems to be one of the alternatives for projects to find a way of being funded. It's important to use this moment to show that open models are much more effective and not as obsolete as closed ones, Olivier says.\n\nPlatoniq have both online and offline networks and are taking advantage of the fact that Mallorca residents pay half price travel to maintain them - meaning they can go to say, Bilbao, and work with interesting people for a few days, something they couldn't do before. He thinks it's necessary for people to meet each other and have a sprint from time to time and concentrate on the things to develop instead of having an online to do list - sometimes it's good to be located somewhere and work with people for a few days and then to meet on Internet.\n\n<strong>Testing the limits</strong>\n\nA <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/06/07/spain-crowdfunding-against-the-impunity-of-the-banks/\">recent campaign</a> on Goteo to fund a legal case against the ex-director of one the crisis ridden banks in Spain has tested the limits of the platform - normally they have between 8,000 and 10,00 visits a day and with this campaign they had double that amount in the first hour, collapsing the server. So many people are fed up of the situation where banks always get public money whatever they do while there is no money for R+D, health, education etc. that they responded, he says. They had to change the server in the middle of the campaign and the idea was to get \u20ac15000 in six days, and they got it in 24 hours and if there hadn't of been the server problem, they would probably have got it in 3 hours. It also created the schizophrenic situation of using a bank payment platform to go against the banks. It's a very interesting sociological case to investigate Olivier feels, being, he thinks, the first political/social campaign done through crowdfunding, and therefore a very interesting citizen evolution in his opinion.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 16:49:25", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 10:38:22.341404", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1003, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21239, "user_id": 2468, "topic_id": 5957, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>fine for me!</b>\n\nPerfect!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-03 23:09:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.086984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17827, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1117, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>No criticism intended \u2013 just an observation</b>\n\nHi Benjamin, good to meet you. :-)\u00a0\n\nI meant no criticism \u2013 I could not resist making the point, the aesthetics are so obvious. Unlike you, I did not ask around for feedback around the relational side of this ER experience. Personally (and\u00a0<em>only</em> personally) I find the roughness quite liberating. In the LOTE conference, someone had the idea to do a session called \"Dark sarcasm\". The whole point was to venture\u00a0out of one's comfort zone, in areas like system collapse, YOYO vs. WOOO etc. You were sure to get verbally abused for saying stuff like \"we could use solar\" unless you were familiar with the math\u00a0(how many Kw per square meter of state-of-the-art solar panel?); and when somebody got sniped, everyone else would cheer (including, often, the person being abused). It was very refreshing: we could turn things around in our heads, be crazy and creative in suggesting things because the nutty stuff would be immediately shot down by the others. It was a tough environment for ideas, with strong evolutionary pressure \u2013 hence rapid progress. That someone (Smari, I think) got it right: if you don't criticize an idea for fear of hurting the person \u00a0that suggests it, you are missing learning opportunities. Plus, once you are out there trying to start some crazy project, the bad guys will throw all of those criticitisms at you \u2013 and your idea will have an underdeveloped immune system to fight them off with.\n\nThis is by no means a characteristic of Edgeryders alone.\u00a0At CCC, the conference spurred by the Chaos Computer Club \u2013 possibly the most impressive hacker conference in Europe \u2013 MCs introduce Q&amp;A sessions as follows: \"Don't thank anyone and don't say who you are, we don't care. Just ask the question, then sit down.\"\n\nThis might sound horrible and mean, but it just saves you so much time. Very soon it sinks in that that's the way things work, so you stop taking it personally.\u00a0And in the end, you come to expect from your friends and respected peers to go for your throat in debates: better they do it in the seminar room than life doing it in the field!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-21 14:27:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.489707", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 397, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16145], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32945, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5163, "post_number": 31, "raw": "<b>Just come</b>\n\nAnd talk to Noemi.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-25 23:01:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.783953", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32940], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17012, "user_id": 1673, "topic_id": 2391, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Yes</b>\n\nThank you, Noemi,\n\nyes, this would be the way to go.

Actually @trythis was the inspiration for the Rasoberry Pi local media servers after the Nepal earthquake last year, and this way also for Pocket University. Lots of inspiration coming from that guy :-) I'd be interested to utilize a small casting / pocket university like setup for teaching better coffee farming in <a href=\"https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hansapur,+Nepal/@28.0295096,84.4467343,14676a,20y,41.63h,62.8t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x39953fa2e0beb76d:0xeb467b0ef0d2342b!8m2!3d28.1652914!4d84.6322156?hl=en\">Hansapur, Gorkha, Nepal</a>.

Just a small project for now, with a friend from last year going there around next week and then again in February. The problem is obviously getting the coffee farming content together, in Nepali \u2026\n\n<strong>Edit 1:</strong> For extending smallcasting to two-way communication, it would of course be perfect to have a small cheap MP3 player with recorder. But does not exist as far as I know. Feedback recording via mobile phone is possible for &gt;80% of people in low-infrastructure regions, but of course voice quality is an issue then. Most times, I get back to using old-ish smartphones since they are available for &lt;15 EUR used in Europe. Battery capacity is an issue of course \u2026\n\n<strong>Edit 2:</strong> Two hardware inspirations for @trythis which I found for Pocket University: (1) there are 10-20 MP3 player models which can be fitted with an <a href=\"http://www.rockbox.org/\">aftermarket open source firmware</a> \u2026 of course good to mod / extend the player.

I am also part of the 99%. Upper Space started as an experiment to utilise the popularity of street art as a form of social agency. We operate in the largest gallery in the world - our streets; our public realm. The Upper Space started as an organic creation - no rules, no structures - as volunteers worked together with others knowing that we needed to do something to counteract the social, environmental and spacial justice issues that we all care about but not knowing what shape or form this solution would take. So now 2 years later we have the Upper Space, a not-for-profit community interest company that seeks to use creative dissidence and empowerment methodology to directly engage with social, environmental and spacial justice issues within the UK and Abroad. The Upper Space operates within a non-hierarchical, horizontal structure with members from artist; academic; community and public networks. I spend my days walking a divide between the culture that I dream about and the spectacle of culture that is my reality. Sometimes this makes me feel very isolated - even from close friends, as when you choose to engage with these issues that seem so incredibly complex and oppressive and when our supposedly democratic channels for political and social representation fail to mirror the ideas and wishes of a generation then your ability to influence feels so small and diminished. When these democratic channels fail to represent the wishes of our generation it is our duty as citizens to pursue more direct channels of empowerment. So to counteract this enclosure, I spend my time in the Upper Space. In light of these feelings it is so very encouraging to see initiatives like Edgeryders to emerge from the enclosure, and speaking on behalf of our members, Upper Space is ready and waiting to share and help develop these collaborative ideas.</em> \u2013 <strong>Barney, UK</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3cd87b8f6f787976c8f7f35400e39d0c03e3d95a.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"100\"><br>If to be an Edgeryder means to think outside the box, can\u2019t stand idle and passive, revolt, volunteer, manipulate technology, be polyglot and globe-trotting, if that means to feel part of a community, whether it\u2019s a digital,\u00a0 virtual or physical community and rise up these times of crisis: than I\u2019m an Edgeryder and there is a big community of us all around you! Edgeryders have to face challenges as balance and freedom, flexicurity and glocalisation\u2026and are not afraid to argue, run risks and take action for the ideals they stand for! This means to be personally engaged and connected to significant output in order to build a shared vision of how we can work together to achieve a positive transition for everybody in a right way! I\u2019m here, ready to start to meet this big community of people that can inspire each other!</em> - <strong>Irene, Italy</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am interested in Edgeryders because I think people need as many access points to each other, to the communication necessary to build understanding, common goals and efficient pathways to achievement, as possible in our increasingly connected, interdependent world. The anonymity engendered through poverty, exclusion, and lack of opportunity has not disappeared, but been increased by the burgeoning anonymity of a crowd-sourced popularity on sites where people can share digital indicators of success and wealth- or the lack thereof. The crisis-point markers of dislocation, non-involvement, or the possibilities of non-peaceful responses to societal dysfunction are also more evident, and more immediate, through online networks.<span> </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">So to be involved in a proactive, multi-sourced project which embraces the conditions of the world we live in, the needs and aspirations of all levels of society, and invites the participation of all members of the local-regional-world community, regardless of age, education, culture, is a wonderful opportunity. Members can bring as many ideas and skills to the \"table\" as possible, can build the concepts of citizenship which can bring us through the transition from a disparate, even desperate collection of communities, corporate, government and non-governmental entities, to a world where the rights of humanity, of all the millions of species of earthlings sharing this planet, can be recognized, upheld, and conditions of life improved to optimal sustainable levels. Knowledge, experience, communication and involvement are the key. I hope people of all origins and skillsets have the opportunity to participate, contribute, and move together to our interdependent future.

Koshy, Creator- Founder Autism for Help Village Project Trust, India</strong> \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn what way are you an Edgeryder? <em>An explorer \u2015 of beauty, consciousness, empowerment, structures of technology and open governance \u2015 I intertwine a creative spirit with a passion for human progress. An experienced web communicator, project manager and analyst, I excel at managing complex flows of information and believe in the power of collective intelligence. My sense of observation helps me to assess internal and external needs of businesses and governments. For several years, I\u2019ve been passionate about open government. It has mostly meant observing other countries develop initiatives while being utterly disappointed for not putting my shoulder to the wheel, since Quebec is not yet an open government.\u00a0</em> Why part of the Edgeryders community?\u00a0 <em>That each one of us has the opportunity to attain the highest vision of who she/he is: shouldn't it be the goal of every State? Every flower in the fields tries to grow as straight and as high as possible, to hatch all the splendor of his beautiful petals. It's the same for human beings. We have within us a force (empowerment) that drives us to transcendence. Each person is unique and wonderful. The Edgeryders recognize the potential of each, try to identify problems and seek collective solutions to eliminate barriers to development. An orphan of open government, until this new type of governance is adopted by Quebec, I'm so passionate about this and I believe so much in its potential for society that I do not want to wait a second longer to participate. I like how the Edgeryders show optimism, pay attention to solutions, and seek collaboration to determine the \"right\" priorities for development. I wish us good luck!</em> \u2013 <strong>Lyne, Canada</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>People at the fringes of different fields or spaces, who are able to cross between them and bring ideas or information to both, I think, are edgeryders. I live in a little hexayurt on the border between IT, a world made of open source, open hardware and creative commons projects and accomplishments, and the neighbouring world of sustainability, green-ness and the building of resilience and mutual support in local communities. I think there is a bright future in teaching people how to make use of the huge resources we have at our fingertips, to actually solve day to day problems in our communities and families around us. Just across the river there is also the world of art, creativity and self expression. So far, these worlds have few bridges, but I hope that they are growing, and I've seen how inspiring it can be to all kinds of people to break open the world around us and see that we can actually fabricate it ourselves. Why be part of the community? I love to find out about new ways to do things, or to build on existing knowledge and especially to find ways to inspire people who are faced with crumbling expectations as a result of the financial and ecological situation on the planet. I feel a responsibility as well as a calling to bring these concepts to wider audiences.</em> \u2013 <strong>Ale, Spain</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1ef39428425813e16840c9924aabbce2a7e27a45.JPG\" width=\"283\" height=\"360\"><br>I am a web editor and a mother of 4, aged 22, 20, 16, 14.

I wrote my PhD thesis about European Currency Unit in the 80's, when nobody could imagine that the Euro would take the place of national currencies. I think that social networks and web communities are a worth new way to experiment a broader citizenship in UE.

I faithfully and passionately covered this radio show extensively in 2009 and part of 2010. Every week, I was tweeting live about everything that was discussed at the show, both in English and French, and the following days, I blogged in French about the invited guest(s) and the issues discussed at the show. I did this for many months, hoping that the information about open government, which was produced only in English, would one day cross the barriers of languages, and reach the ears of French-speaking citizens and policy makers. I was hoping that this knowledge about open government would be understood by those who do not speak English.\n\nI really enjoyed the collaboration with Adriel and will always remain grateful, because through him and his guests, I learned a lot about open government and the tremendous efforts of citizens and government managers to implement it. I was, after all, a chosen student, attending the School for gifted newbies of professor of Aracalm (one of Adriel's many virtual identities).\n\nBut it came to a point where my eyes would suddenty be flodded with a stream of tears, as I was hearing about all the wonderful projects and initiatives being carried elsewhere, while absolutely nothing was happening at my place. So I had to stop listening, because the pain was getting too hard to bare.\n\nWhen I met Adriel Hampton in person in Edmonton, in October 2010, he gave me a boost of energy. He told me, from the height of his stature (he is two heads taller than me), \"<em>Be bold!</em>\". These two words had the effect of thunder and lightning on me. They gave me wings and the courage to propose a bold opengov project, an hybrid multilateral partnership to unify Francophonie around opengov issues.\n\nMy project has not been successful. Risk aversion took over it and I was finally told that \"<em>the project does not meet business criteria</em>\" and that \"<em>there is no solution</em>\".\n\nBut 3 weeks later, the United States and Brazil jointly launched the Open Government Partnership. More tears flowed down my cheeks, on September 20, as I watched more than 40 countries sign the opengov declaration on my computer screen, as this event was streamed live. At least, I was comforted for the relevance of the ideas proposed in the project.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, I joined the fantastic Edgeryders team of the Council of Europe. Because all the doors had been closed on me, I let others try to walk in the direction I had pointed. They created <a href=\"http://democratieouverte.org/\">D\u00e9mocratie ouverte.org</a>, a we-blog, set up at the beginning of 2012 by lobbyists Jean-Francois Gauthier (in Quebec) and Cyril Lage (in France).\n\nThey organized a barcamp meeting in Paris in April 2012 (<a href=\"http://parlement-et-citoyens.fr/parlement-et-citoyens\">GouvCamp</a>).\n\nI am thankful that for months, Allison Hornery has been closely following the evolution of opengov in the Francophonie world. She was reminding me from time to time, that she was observing what was (not!) happening. When she proposed a first bilingual edition of Gov 2.0 Radio, I was totally thrilled by this proposal. It had an illuminating effect in my mind, as I immediately saw the show's influence extend its action to all people and all languages\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe first multilingual edition of Gov 2.0 Radio was an interview of <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/jeff00720\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gauthier</a> (an Edgeryders participant) a lobbyist consultant from Loran Technologies, wrapping up the GouvCamp, which took place in Paris on April 10, 2012. Allison asked a series of questions in English, and as co-host, I repeated approximately the same questions in French. The interview conducted in French, however, was much more complete and detailed, as I had more time with the guest to go deeper and discuss, not only about Quebec and France, but the overall situation encompassing all countries of the Francophonie .\n\nFrom the beginning, I believed in what Gov 2.0 Radio does, in its mission, in its influence, and its active role to identify and support change.\n\nNow that this first multilingual edition went well, there is an opportunity to repeat this experience, and slowly build a multilingual programme, from which opengov and innovation can expand, in the long run, in all languages and all countries around the world.\n\nIf you have suggestions of non-anglophone guests, passionate activists, government officials, organization managers, innovators, thinkers, etc., building our future, please, do not hesitate to share your recommendations!\u00a0\n\n<span><span>I send a big hug of gratitude</span> <span>to Allison</span> <span>and</span> <span>her partner</span></span> from Cofluence, John Wells.

I have a slightly (but importantly) different formulation. We are a collective intelligence platform for building the Open Village. Of course, Open Village entails, say, wikis on how to remove the parchment from Nepali coffee. But the difference is there: it is collective action, strung together by a common narrative. And that means...\n\n<strong>Mapping to users and what they want.\u00a0</strong>... that we serve first and foremost users of type 2. This is not a stretch: it is what happens already. The most thriving, enthushiastic corners of edgeryders.eu have always been the flagship project groups.\u00a0\n\nSocially, being part of a team that is building something is very different from being a user of a question/answer website. Humans love being in teams. It provides them with an additional motivational boost to keep coming back to the website. It makes a small conversation with 10 people feel cozy and focused\u00a0rather than lonely. @Matthias , you once told me that your blog has quite a lot of visits: it contains great instructable, so people search for \"how to XYZ\" and Google sends them to your blog. They read and go their way. Almost no one stops even to say \"thank you, that solved my problem\", let alone joining your effort.\u00a0Additionally, all other things being equal,\u00a0focused and \"fringe\" websites are better at creating community than generalist ones: they serve a relatively small group very well, and that group repays them with fierce loyalty and great friendship.\u00a0\n\nOf course, you can in principle build a question/answer website (or a challenge/response one). That would be Quora (\"ask anything, collective intelligence will answer\" \u2013 quite similar to \"a platform for open-source everything\". But this only works at humongous scales.\u00a0Quora has been burning cash for seven years (160 million in VC investment) and climbed to 100 million unique visitors per month before it could even start talking about monetizing. Profit is not even remotely close.\u00a0\n\nThat brings me to the <strong>interaction style</strong>. I submit that making the site feel like a lower-grade Quora would be a mistake. We know this. People come for unMonastery. People come for OpenCare, or OpenVillage. People don't come to Edgeryders as they would to StackOverflow, to ask a well-framed question about a specific proble they are trying to solve. They come to find like-minded people and be part of their work. So, I think the higher-level entity of Discourse (categories) should be framed as projects, or actions, or something like that.\u00a0<em>Then</em>\u00a0building the project will entail, at times, writing careful wikis, and\u00a0<em>those</em>\u00a0will be picked up by Google, which will send us traffic. But hopefully, people passing by will find a thriving small community with a sense of purpose, and some will stay. As for the hardcore OpenVillagers, they will find reinforcement of the narrative: \"we are building the OpenVillage. I am in a team with @johncoate and @Nadia on forgiving conflict resolution methods\", or whatever. This is very, very different from \"matching my question with an expert who has the answer\", because most people have no clear question. They are looking for partners, friends, coworkers, comrades. Humans. Not information.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI have a hypothesis. It's just a hypothesis, but I though it through and I ask you to take it seriously. This: the \"encyclopedian\" approach of EarthOS is one of the reasons why it did not catch up. It was undersocialized. It was a library of Alexandria, without Hyapatia. It implied that the reader's role was to RTFM. Good for highly motivated hackers with a clear goal (if I can't get my code to run, I just want a solution that removes my roadblock, I don't want to discuss!), bad for people who are looking, as Matt poetically put it, \"for their tribe\".\u00a0\n\nSo how do you order knowledge? Same as ever: with <strong>tags</strong>. We can even make this a thing: \"help reorder and maintain our body of knowledge! Make things searchable! Here are guidelines, click on this button to pick a random topic and tag it\" (kinda sorta like OpenEthnographer). But I think it is important we give people the ability to participate in the OV \u2013 which has a ten year time horizon: very delayed gratification, pretty hard for most of us \u2013 by participating in a smaller, shorter project like OpenCare or OpenInsulin or Future Makers. By the way: not too sure of pseudo-hierarchical tags.

This post is reporting on our work and what it means to be\u00a0in service of community as much as in service of the\u00a0client, in this case Galway City Council. Another\u00a0post will follow introducing some of the people and projects we met, but first: how we did it and what we can offer openly\u00a0as\u00a0learnings.\n\nAs the city was racing as a candidate for the title, considerable engagement had already been initiated: a number of speak outs, public meetings and workshops were organised to surface people\u2019s vision for Galway 2020 and ideas for how to fulfill it. As it happens when an administration opens the door, <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2013/02/04/building-policy-oriented-communities-for-the-european-scale/\">creativity and innovation come in</a>. Our mandate going in was to ensure the edgiest ideas out there don\u2019t fall off the grid because of lacking capacity to bring them in, or because they are not championed by established organisations.\n\n<strong>The community engagement process we ran was inclusive in entry, through a set of shared rules, but selective in exit, to make sure the city can take responsibility for delivery. </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We met with grassroots groups: artists, ecologists, alternative arts (in dance, theatre), or producers of growing festivals; we proposed a template to send in project outlines and offered to help turn them into bid book amenable projects.</li>\n\n<li>We proposed to the Galway 2020 team a programme called \u201cThe Edge of Culture\u201d, to upsell what these creative ideas have in common: a potential for radically changing the local urban landscape and a potential for leaders to become the next generation of cultural operators.</li>\n\n<li>In order to make the projects more international in scope we reached out to members and projects in the Edgeryders network whose work was aligned with the Galway projects and invited them to partner up.</li>\n\n<li>We worked with Galway 2020 to filter ideas - looking at how well developed they were for the bid requirements and if the remaining work needed could fit a very tight schedule (this happened in May for delivery in May).</li>\n\n<li>It is noteworthy that the Galway\u2019s strategy has somewhat shifted during the period of our involvement. When we first were brought in, the cultural programme was perceived to be in need of more projects. So, we were asked to involve local actors at the edge to bring projects in, and, this way, enrich the cultural programme. As the work progressed and projects grew in numbers and quality, it was decided that there was a need to focus on <em>fewer</em> projects \u2013 hence the filtering phase described above.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat we delivered:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>11 projects birthed by alternative or non-traditional cultural operators (May - April); out of these, 4 projects should be included in the bidbook, whereas the rest are to be considered and local collaborations resumed conditional upon the city\u2019s win of the ECOC title</li>\n\n<li>8 formal partnerships for the projects featured in the bidbook</li>\n\n<li><strong>As an inherent effect of having worked with diverse groups, we can convey knowledge about community dynamics, expectations and the social contract underpinning any public engagement process</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe would like to unpack this last contribution into key insights to accompany Galway 2020 team\u2019s work in the future, should it become European Capital of Culture 2020:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Recognising great ideas and finding ways to execute them if the city wins the title</strong>. We saw little differences in the qualities of projects submitted by local groups: most ideas were results of community conversations, with proponents skilled at convening local groups and collaborating on the ground. As opposed to being dreamed up by one single person, projects therefore speak for broader constituencies and could have a great return on community mobilization if they end up implemented (despite not getting featured in the bidbook).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tighter integration needed in the future between external collaborators and core team</strong>. There is an inherent information asymmetry when partners or consultants are brought on board. This makes it challenging to discover opportunities (how smaller projects might be fit in existing strands; how an urban project might be refitted for rural places); or to detect redundancy early on (similar ideas might be kept or dropped, creating competition losers instead of collaboration). Tighter integration would therefore increase overall efficiency by generating stronger projects - more briefing meetings, collaborative tasks, full access to historic documentation etc.</li>\n\n<li><strong>All eyes on social dynamics: network building as legacy of the ECOC process.</strong> During the final phase of the race, teams are naturally overstretched aggregating various pieces of work into a coherent picture which is the bidbook writing. The risk is losing sight of expectations: everyone who has been involved in Galway 2020 by attending an event, contributing an idea or engaging in a selection process expects to be informed or hear back, and rightly so. Our team was adamant about this and tried to mitigate risks of disappointment by keeping groups informed, even if only to communicate uncertainty. We also brought people together socially to make visible the returns of participation: they are connecting with each other. We highly recommend more investment in long term community building, by keeping work open and transparent to maximize support actions for Galway 2020.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2016-06-08 10:44:45", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:33.244072", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1029, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2569], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4134, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4101, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd72015a44f9c5200d943d92711f2e12a0ecc313.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\"><br>\n\nA big part of my family is Ethiopian. This is also the main reason I packed my bags and headed off to Addis Ababa\n\n... to participate in my beautiful cousins\u2019 weddings.\n\nMy cousin made clear I was expected to show up in a Habesha Kemis. So on arrival I headed off to Shiro Meda to find a tailor.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/172308219b7f26802191799083f24d739217aa31.jpg\" width=\"299\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nI liked it so much I ended up getting a second one made.\n\nThe wedding itself was a ball. With our family being spread across the globe it is rare for so many of us to be in one place at the same time. I really appreciated being able to spend time together in celebration of the most important element of a happy life... love.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9ed448321a237d3414a2bf16efc7fcffa94978a3.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\"><br>\n\nOn the ride to venue where we would dance and try to keep the groom from picking up the bride (yes, literally- tradition), we came into the topic of religion.\n\nI was asked about my religious beliefs which struck me as quite an odd question. .\n\n... Until I found myself in the middle of a massive Timket (Epiphany) procession in a different part of the country a week later.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa29e5bf3b34b6c3775bf6319ff165b60d80bd9a.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\"><br>\n\nThe same thing happened on numerous occasions in different parts of the country.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Religion is a big deal in Ethiopia. So is peace.</h3>\n\nSo Ethiopia is home to oh about 200 ethnic groups and around 80 languages. However diverse I knew the country was, in my mind always was associated with Christianity and Judaism... a long history that began over 2000 years ago. The Hebrew influence and identity is pretty clear when you wander around Gondar and Lalibela, especially if you dig into historical information about different dynasties that ruled and shaped Ethiopia throughout the centuries.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e4d7581b87da395964fd059143a38b34bb19a271.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\"><br>\n\nSo I was surprised to learn just how large a proportion of the population the Muslim minority is. Almost 40 percent, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And that the one Jewish person in the Bet-Israel village is the guy running the museum frequented by tourists on pilgrimages. Where is everyone?! Oh yeah. Pretty much everyone was evacuated to Israel after the massive drought in the 80s.\n\nI feel a link to this diaspora, all diaspora really. There is something those of us born with feet in many worlds discover sooner or later. That we are not one or the other, but something else.. ours are third, remix, cultures. Religion is one of those sensitive areas we have to develop mechanisms for navigating.\n\nWithin my family there are ties to several mega-cities of Africa and Asia where more than half of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Muslims, and around sixty percent of the world\u2019s 2 billion Christians, live. I was born and have lived in different parts of a Western liberal Europe not sure how to deal with growing tensions between different social groups.\n\nHere and there, what we think of as religious and or ethnic conflicts are often intimately tied to underlying conflicts over resources like land or water.\n\nRwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and the <a href=\"https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/25677/1/gupea_2077_25677_1.pdf\">pressure on land has often been put forward as an important factor in the 1994 genocide</a>. I cannot remember where I heard that in the case of Rwanda there were more intra-ethnic murders than between different ethnic groups... the genocide was partially fueled by the need to free up resources. If memory serves me, they had a system ( currently being reformed) in which all land would be passed on to the first son. Which left a class of landless, disenfranchised young men with no hope of accessing a brighter economic future unless some of that land could be freed up...\n\nIsrael and Palestine is another example. At the source of this conflict, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Rothstein\">Bo Rothstein</a>, lies mixing of religious rhetoric with what is essentially a struggle over assets. He claims that you would create the foundation for lasting peace by focusing on resolving the land/economic disputes with compromises for everyone (Swedish article): <a href=\"http://www.svd.se/opinion/brannpunkt/markavtal-kan-stoppa-valdet_3777014.svd\">http://www.svd.se/\u2026/markavtal-kan-stoppa-valdet_3777014</a>\n\n<span><span><span>Other examples of legacy injustice include (thanks <a href=\"/u/jaycousins\">@Jaycousins</a></span> ):\n\n<span>Egypt - land is divided amongst all children so within a couple of generations everyone has a tiny patch they can't profit from - the result is illegally constructed tower blocks on most of the rare and fertile land in Egypt and a lot of in-family tensions. </span></span></span>\n\n<span><span><span>Likewise In England or any other Western Country, the peasantry had their inheritance stolen out from under them long before the lords and merchants started robbing foreign soil. </span></span></span>\n\n\u2026 There is much to be learned from Ethiopian history about the importance of tackling inequalities in distribution of property and use rights for building lasting peace. Especially in societies where formal property laws and customary property rights arrangements exist in parallel. I believe some of those lessons are also relevant in societies where land rights are secure but ownership of property is highly concentrated.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Fixing legacy injustice: Reforming dysfunctional property laws and peace between ethnic groups</h2>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b7c6df2dcd490cfff2c18615a1910e2069282b86.jpg\" width=\"299\" height=\"500\"><br>Justice is a prerequisite for peace. While the murderous fascist regime known as the Derg got a lot of things wrong, they did push through land right reforms.\n\nPrior to the civil war against the old feudal order (Haile Selassie, also known as Ras Tefari), the Muslim population was excluded from being able to access land as they were passed along hereditary lines. So your family had to own land in order for you to have hope of owning land. This was the Ristegna system.\n\nThen there was the Gultegna, the nobility, which were granted the right to a fat chunk of the surplus from the land tended by farmers. Basically a rentier class that contributed little or nothing to the development of the country and life of their fellow Ethiopians.\n\nBoth were upended by the revolution and land redistributed and finally nationalised. Why?\n\nOne of the persistent calls for social justice in the revolution, also during the Derg period, was \u201cland to the tiller\u201d. All the different interest groups got behind this reform as a fundamental requirement. The military dictators could not back out on this demand as they would loose legitimacy amongst the soldiers, many of whom hailed from the southern parts of the country where the problems of unfair distribution of land was particularly strong for historical reasons.\n\nThere are still problems, and new ones. Ethiopia is also undeniably doing a lot better than many of the other countries in the region- my impression was that there is a fundamental belief that things are improving, also for those at the wrong end of the power spectrum. Clearly the picture painted depends on who you ask but I could see for myself that e.g. infrastructure is much better in many parts of the country than it used to be.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c08fb7c790b42fd792251b59221fc35aedc4a223.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\"><br>\n\n<strong>Most of all people are very aware of how fragile and important peace is</strong>. The story of a popular revolution co-opted by a military regime that then did its best to murder an entire generation is still fresh in the collective memory. I am reminded of this every time I hear any talk of revolution: the move towards a western style liberal democracy is not one that Ethiopians I spoke to value highly. Rather, it is economic rights and development that seem to be at the heart of their concerns.\n\nIf we are to achieve peace at home, we need to think about how we tackle legacy injustices against people in different parts of a globalised world. The central pillar is property law and ownership. As Ethiopians learned, it makes sense to start there and not let up till an acceptable solution is reached.\n\nThere will be losers. However if they are taking up so much space that it threatens the ability of others to survive. Well, they... all of us, may end up losing a lot more than excess capacity.", "created_at": "2015-02-13 10:22:57", "updated_at": "2020-11-04 14:28:45.815468", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1487, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 188.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1450, 5, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28323, "user_id": 2280, "topic_id": 3476, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>danohu</b>\n\nBrilliant,\n\nunfortunately I cannot come to Berlin for the presentation but please be so kind and send me the presentation.\n\nMany greetings\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-16 15:15:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.127076", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11119, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3492, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Participants page is unpublished for privacy reasons.</b>\n\n<a href=\"/knowlab-participants\">Here's</a> where you can help edit.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-19 16:01:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.383121", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7773], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1498, "user_id": 74, "topic_id": 1465, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I don't usually have regrets.

The reason being that we both are part of a movement to make health- and social care accessible, open source, privacy-friendly and participatory.\u00a0\n\nIt turns out that, when faced with care challenges, communities rise to meet them. By doing so, they step outside of our current paradigm, one of provision of care services by a combination of the state and private business. This changes the game completely to one of decentralization and reciprocity.\n\nInitiatives such as\u00a0Diy Orthodontics\u00a0and\u00a0Diabetes Pumps\u00a0are just the tip of the iceberg. In Benin, Jean Paul Doussou has run an impressive grassroots initiative to improve cardiac health using a Facebook group and Edgeryders-like community management techniques. In Greece communities are going so far as to run a\u00a0shadow zero-cash health care system. In Dorotea, a small village in mid-northern Sweden, citizens have squatted the hospital facilities and started running health services for locals on a voluntary basis . Everywhere we look we are seeing a lot of radical experimentation. \u00a0\n\nWhich raises some questions\u2026\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><i>How do these initiatives manage to navigate the legal, administrative, and cultural obstacles to their widespread adoption?</i></li>\n\n<li><i>How do we ensure that the devices which keep us healthy are safe and that there is an acceptable social contract for the code that runs in our bodies?</i></li>\n\n<li><i>Do we even know\u00a0what we mean when we talk about care?</i></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese services and solutions often display an uncanny degree of efficiency. But they cannot easily be added to our existing care system. They are too strange: ad hoc, blurry at the edges, often existing in legal gray areas. Also many of them are small, very specific services run on volunteer basis. This has its challenges. One of which is providing continuity and coherence\u00a0over a long periods of time as we learned from our delve into\u00a0Stewardship.\n\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600\" id=\"doc_54620\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/263421647/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-nsc4DqPeVgaG5GC7o0G1&amp;show_recommendations=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Let\u2019s take the example of Dementia.</h3>\n\nThe goal in Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment is rehabilitation. This requires a lot of patience- figuring out what can the person can\u2019t do anymore, and identifying the right kind of tool to support them. If they have had a stroke and are weak on one side this may mean a cane, or a walker.\u00a0But equally important, you also figure out what can the person still do, about 98 % of people \u201cwant to live at home with dementia, so the goal here is to maximize the person\u2019s functioning independence and embed them in an environment that supports them.\n\n<strong>Right now Edgeryders is pioneering\u00a0a new initiative in which we\u00a0design\u00a0and test\u00a0a community-driven model for social and health care</strong>. We are doing this together with a number of partners which include the City of Milan (they've been looking in this direction for some time now).\n\n<strong>We start by finding and understanding some of the\u00a0care services that communities are providing - right now</strong> to people that the state and private business have let down. We then ask how we, as societies, would need to change for them to continue to exist, and to scale where possible. We are\u00a0discussing, among other things:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The economic truism that \"health care costs can only go up, never down\", and why that's a fallacy.</li>\n\n<li>The difficult relationship between care giving and management culture.</li>\n\n<li>Greece's shadow health care service. 68 clinics with no legal status, don't accept money and provide free health care to people out the public health care system.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>A makerspace in England with a diverse user base, where people find meaning (and income) through engaging with open technologies.</li>\n\n<li>a decentralized 9-1-1 alternative built for and by people who are not well served by existing emergency response services.</li>\n\n<li>How we (you and me and everyone we know)\u00a0can help tackle some of the messy challenges involved\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe cannot, and should not, do this alone. <strong>Edgeryders mission is to complement, no compete with,\u00a0existing initiatives and people doing important work.</strong>\u00a0So we are\u00a0supporting busy people active in community care space to join this common conversation. <strong>We fund people running existing projects\u00a0to monitor themselves and share their knowledge and learn from each other.</strong> If Helliniko had assesment that health economist could read they could have reached goal of influencing how public health system works. Their experience would be more legible and helpful to others who wish to set up similar initiatives elsewhere. Possibly even influence policymakers to change disfunctional elements in health- and social care systems: in Greece and beyond.\n\n<span><strong>Want to get involved?</strong> Check out the Op3n Fellowship Program at\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SqgtX2\">http://bit.ly/1SqgtX2</a>. </span>\n\n<span><em><strong>Don't hesitate to ask questions or for help with developing your contribution</strong>\u00a0- it's what we are here for.\u00a0\u00a0You can tweet <a href=\"http://twitter.com/edgeryders\">@edgeryders</a> or write to\u00a0<a href=\"community@edgeryders.eu\">community@edgeryders.eu</a>\u00a0 \u00a0(please use hashtag \\#op3ncare so we know what it's about).</em></span>\n\nMore info about the research project\u00a0<a href=\"/t/welcome-to-opencare/4858\">http://bit.ly/26JAEZv</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-02 06:29:32", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:38:48.610435", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1120, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31502, "user_id": 347, "topic_id": 5132, "post_number": 35, "raw": "<b>Groceries</b>\n\nI will land in Bruxelles Wednesday\u00a024th, so if the grocerie tour is late afternoon, i'm in!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-15 14:12:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.189581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31315], "is_liked_by": [2330], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17131, "user_id": 33, "topic_id": 1345, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Get that network-party started</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nHi Alberto,\n\nI\u2019m glad you agree with me! It seems to me as well that today theory to the layman has the same effect as kryptonite on Superman. Theory is NOT better than practice and vice versa. They have to remain in tandem, otherwise you loose touch.\n\nAnd as you pinpointed, it is indeed finding the theory you need. That\u2019s why I think a community of like-minded people could offer the necessary and relevant support. The Internet is a bottomless pit of information and with all the recent adjustments and customization on Google\u2019s part it becomes more and more difficult to find what you actually need when you need it.\n\nA perfect example of what a website could look like is barbelith.com. I am still in awe at the mutually beneficial discussions that arise from the activity of the users on there. And it\u2019s perfectly moderated so as to promote the productivity of the discussions and to prevent less serious users from intervening with disparaging comments. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a lot of people would find Barbelith useful even when it comes to finding the type of theories we are discussing now. However, the website is created by a closed underground community around LARP(live active role playing) games and it\u2019s pretty difficult to get in and contribute to the discussions, but you can still read everyone\u2019s posts without being a member.\n\nAnother possibility would be to visit the websites of different universities and check out the curriculums for the different courses that are relevant to you. Most universities have the teachers post the curriculums online in their respective course catalogues. At \u00c5rhus University for example, they list the main bibliography for each course under \u201cLiteratur\u201d. Here\u2019s an example of my search within the domain of business and social sciences:\n\n<a href=\"http://kursuskatalog.au.dk/#!mainArea=4\">http://kursuskatalog.au.dk/#!mainArea=4</a>\n\nThis is quite a nerdy tactic to employ, but nonetheless, it\u2019s a good place to start.\n\nIn Denmark and Germany for example the universities are free and open to all. This means you can go to lectures without being enrolled at the university. This would be another good method of finding theoretical suggestions.\n\nAnd, since we do live in a network society, I would also encourage really making use of that network. Don\u2019t be shy to ask people around you even if you don\u2019t know them well, maybe they know someone who can help, or how to point you in the right direction in another way. Send a message to that 235<sup>th</sup> friend you have on Facebook whom you never talk to but who just might know something useful to you. If all else fails and you do not have a network of people within the desired field, you can make a clandestine visit to the uni\u2019s Friday bar and share a beer with someone who can give you a hint ;)\n\nAnd once that circle of peers has been established in some way, I\u2019m suggesting that you use those people to contextualize your own experiences on the work market. Find people smarter than you who can help you understand what\u2019s going on and point you in the right direction. Even if they can\u2019t give you good advice, it really helps talking your perspective through with someone else. Their insights will help you look at the matter differently and that might just result in your own progress/peace of mind/enlightenment\u2026 they might not give you all the answers, but present arguments that might help you create a synthesis and better understand your situation.\n\nI hadn\u2019t heard of Dilbert before. Great that you mentioned it, I\u2019ll check it out :D\n\nThank you for your warm re-welcome.

Through the process I learned a lot about what is useful to people starting out with video, and I'd like to offer a more compact workshop at LOTE3 to help Edgeryders use video more effectively and efficiently to communicate our work and ideas. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">Following a suggestion from [Noemi], perhaps this could be a half-day workshop on the final day of LOTE, in which we could work on editing together our footage into a Making of LOTE video.</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">The workshop would loosely follow the structure of FLOSS Manuals' <a href=\"http://www.flossmanuals.net/how-to-use-video-editing-software/\">Guide to Video Editing With Kdenlive</a>, with some extra pointers about commonly used effects and techniques to improve quality and workflow.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">One difficulty with offering a video post production workshop is the lack of quality cross-platform tools. Kdenlive works reliably on Linux and occasionally on Mac. It's possible for people to run an Ubuntu LiveCD from a usb stick, I suppose. I can also offer support for people using Final Cut Pro on OS X, but I don't have experience with any Windows programs. Is there anybody else with experience working with other programs who might like to help with the workshop? Most NLEs work essentially in the same way, just with different names for tools and concepts, and maybe different ways of applying effects etc. So maybe we can talk about basic editing concepts and show how to apply them in different operating systems.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">Another key issue is that most problems in post-production can be alleviated with good organisation and planning before and during shooting. The most common problem in video post-production is not '</font><em><font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">I don't know how to use effects</font></em><font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">', it is '</font><em><font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">I have too much (poorly-planned) footage and don't know what to do with it</font></em><font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">'.</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">Whether shooting with dedicated video cameras or with cellphones, whether shooting every day or just a single 15min session, it would be ideal if those of us planning to shoot video could get together briefly at the start of LOTE as well. Some basic discussions beforehand would ensure that:</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">-we shoot with a clear idea of how the footage is to be used.</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">-our footage is relevant, high quality, and can integrate well with other video</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">-we understand what kind of B-Roll* makes sense, and how it can be used (*details, cutaways, inserts, whatever you want to call it)</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">-we know what / how much other people are planning to shoot</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">-where possible, we use the same technical standards (framerate, sample rate, picture size)</font>\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">-we all have a basic understanding of 'rules of thumb' for lighting, composition, audio recording. (even if we go on to break those rules!)</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">This can all be covered relatively quickly, in less than an hour. Having a quick meeting at the start not only means we work better together and share the task of documenting more evenly, it produces better quality footage and (MOST IMPORTANTLY!) less work in post production. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Source Sans Pro, sans-serif\">So what do you think? Would this be a worthwhile use of our time at LOTE? If anybody would like to be part of these sessions in any way or has any suggestions, please let me know!</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-23 11:41:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:09.201963", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1688, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8908, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 5216, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>This is lovely</b>\n\nMade my day :) not sure how much chopping we'll need on Friday, but we'll see.

More than anything else, a question that I had been asked after my presentation had stuck with me.  A participant suggested that the synopsis I provided hadn\u2019t really engaged with the theme of resilience.  My immediate response \u2013 which I believe, in one sense, is still true \u2013 was that, for me, the idea of resilience is fundamental to the whole Edgeryders project.  I\u2019m simply not sure it is possible to separate a discussion of resilience from the precariousness Edgeryders are faced with on a daily basis.    So, on the one hand, issues of resilience are a <strong>fundamental</strong> facet of young people\u2019s transition to a meaningful and active life simply because of the nature of our current socio-economic predicament.\n\nHowever, I think there is a second sense in which resilience permeates the Edgeryders project \u2013 and not simply because there is a campaign on the subject.  In fact, while the mission reports encapsulated with the Resilience campaign are certainly interesting and speak directly to the theme, they don\u2019t (as yet) produce a particularly coherent picture of Edgeryders\u2019 views on this subject.  (My sense is that this is simply a reflection of the fact that Resilience was the last thematic campaign to be launched, and it is my hope that there will be a new flurry of mission reports in the wake of LOTE and the Unconference.)  This second resilience \u2018thread\u2019 as I will call it is, instead, constituted by Edgeryders\u2019 activities as expressed across the project as a whole \u2013 across all the campaigns.\n\nIn this post, my intention is to draw out some of the ways in which Edgeryders suggest, through their mission reports, that they already possess the knowledge and skills required for a resilient future, as well as the means to propagate that knowledge and those skills amongst their communities.\n\nThe first, and perhaps most important, skill required for a resilient future is the ability to <strong>share.</strong>  Attempting to ensure equality of opportunity in a resilient future requires generosity with time, skills, knowledge and many other resources \u2013 and Edgeryders are demonstrably keen to play their part.  Of greatest significance, I think, is the extent to which Edgeryders\u2019 activities place at their centre shared basic human needs - shared food (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/so-how-else-could-your-community-get-its-food/mission_case/community-agriculture\">Darren\u2019s post on community agriculture</a> or <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/sharing-occupied-spaces-biological-garden\">John G\u2019s on a shared garden</a>), shared places (read here about Augusto\u2019s <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/we-create-games-urban-public-spaces\">CriticalCity Upload</a> game or <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-sharers/mission_case/housing-estate-nexus-commons\">Felix\u2019s description of the housing estate as a nexus of commons</a>), shared art, music or other cultural expressions (see Jeremie\u2019s report on his music event, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/le-molodo%C3%AF-partager-un-espace-et-d%C3%A9velopper-la-vie-cul\">Le Molodo\u00ef</a>) \u2013 and use these to bring communities closer.  For me, closeness means greater resilience \u2013 a greater inclination to offer support and think creatively together \u2013 and at the heart of this is effective communication.  In particular, if the successes of small ventures can be communicated outside of local communities, they can be copied and potentially act as propagators of countless other independent initiatives.  Here, Stefania\u2019s mission report on the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-sharers/mission_case/manifetso2020-urban-regeneration-project\">Manifetso2020</a> project is a shining example: this project uses radio to allow locals to promote their own projects.\n\nThe focus on engaging local communities marks the second facet of Edgeryders\u2019 activities that suggests, to me, that they are already working to build a resilient future.  There is a conspicuous <strong>place embeddedness</strong> in many mission reports, which not only reflects Edgeryders\u2019 own place attachments but reflects a commitment to invigorating those communities in order to encourage participation and collaboration.  A significant part of community resilience is about ensuring those who live there <span>want</span> to keep living there and are <span>able</span> to do so \u2013 it\u2019s about giving people a reason to stay part of communities through the provision of services, resources and a sense that they, too, can contribute.  Edgeryders have written about various community projects from <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/so-how-else-could-your-community-get-its-food/mission_case/community-agriculture\">community supported agriculture</a> to <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/practical-resilience/mission_case/experiments-resilience-small-uk-market-town\">Transition Towns</a>, where locals are involved in all levels of work \u2013 physical, organisational and governance \u2013 as well as reaping the rewards: food, community, skills, knowledge, trust and, above all, better resilience.  I can\u2019t help but think that having the opportunity to experience \u2013 or just get close to \u2013 an alternative living scenario might help bring the possibility of a better, more resilient future to life for those who sense the magnitude of our current socio-economic difficulties but feel ill-equipped to respond productively.  Edgeryders and their projects may have much to offer here as the success stories that inspire others within communities to act.\n\nAnd this is the third sense in which I think that Edgeryders are already demonstrating their skills for resilience \u2013 by acting as <strong>role models</strong>, hubs of knowledge, or co-ordinators of local efforts.  By communicating their own experiences and showing that someone has trod a similar path before, Edgeryders are well-positioned to contribute to the safety-nets that are essential to encourage others to follow their lead.  Importantly, this need not take the form of time- or energy-intensive community support.  Thejaymo asks in a recent mission report, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/so-how-else-could-your-community-get-its-food/mission_case/why-isnt-there-app\">\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there an app for that?\u201d</a> \u2013 and suggests that smartphone technology, specifically apps, could have a vital role to play in using the experiences of resilience trailblazers (like Edgeryders) to support those who wish to follow.\n\nTo wrap up, I want to return to my intention for this post \u2013 to consider how Edgeryders\u2019 actions might be taken forward in support of a more resilient future for everyone.  The mission reports in the platform are abundant with evidence of Edgeryders\u2019 capacity to share, communicate, engage and empower communities, and facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills.  This, to me, seems like a firm foundation on which to build a resilient future.  In closing, I want to make reference to Nirgals\u2019 mission report, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-june-conference/mission_case/fear-comes-unknown\">\u201cFear comes from the unknown\u201d</a> in which he makes an important point about the extent to which our current socio-economic structures leave most of us massively dependent on complex networks for essential things like food.  If there\u2019s one point that Edgeryders have been extremely good at making, it\u2019s that it is possible for us to take back some control and form our own networks that better meet our needs \u2013 and those of our communities \u2013 in ways that build resilience rather than dependency.  For me, this is really what Edgeryders is all about.\n\n(In addition to the mission reports posted under the Resilience campaign, I would also like to acknowledge the input of several mission reports from Caring For Commons in this post.)", "created_at": "2012-06-18 20:55:07", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 16:49:03.167166", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1326, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16780, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1915, "post_number": 3, "raw": ":-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-08 23:35:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.871291", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1353, "user_id": 398, "topic_id": 1320, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\"Many hands make Light work\". My father used to tell me this as we worked in our garden planting veg for the coming season. I misunderstood him, and to quote Robert Frost: \"That has made all the difference\".\n\nIn 2010 there was yet another suicide in our hometown of Birr in Co.Offaly. The reaction this time was stronger than ever before, this was the third suicide in less than three months in a community of only 4000 people. Its hard for people to see members of their community turn to such desperate signal sending, the message itself is bleak, and it forces us to consider the same question, is it worth it? And if so what can we do to make that as obvious as possible...to inspire the youth of even our most solitary environments with enthusiasm, challenge, and exubriance.\n\nPersonally speaking for a moment let me say that this darkness is no stranger to me. Having grown up in the same town it is easy to recognise the pitfalls that can trap and smother the growth of vibrant creative minds left to boredom. There is also the danger of social trends of self-harm as waves of darkened expression befall a community of young people. Its never a solitary incedent, there are waves of attempts, and multiple bleak successes. The message of which suicide becomes the signifier is clear, it is one of seperation, an utter isolation that arises as an individual's mindstate darkens into depression and stress through containing traumas both personal and collective.\n\nIn Ireland there is a lack of space. This may sound hard for many to believe, but while there is plenty of outdoor space, there is a stark lack of indoor spaces that can be used for public facilitation. It is no accident that the Irish are as famous as they are for their tendency to drunkeness. The 'public house' we now call the pub has been, for generations, the only social space in which people could come together beyond their own homes to share in community life. It is a foundation of modern Ireland more for worse than better. In biology there is an evolutionary maxim that states tha<em>t 'all organisms evolve according to adaptations made within and in response to their environmental context'. </em>It is clear that if our small island is to make progress toward upright and balanced behaviour we need to take initiative in providing a specific type of social environment to encourage resort to a more empowered and fuitful mode of social interaction. Without this kind of action all talk of 'public sector social innovation' as a viable alternative to public sector funding in the context of 'austerity' is just that, idle talk.\n\nThere is work to be done, and as mentioned at the outset: \"many hands make Light work\". The present has birthed a new kind of 'social innovation' . In the guideline to this mission it is clearly stated that the wheel, printing press, and internet are all social innovations. These things have something else in common also. They increase the connected nodes of a conscious system that evolves by the constant exchange and modification of information. Our power to, and rate of change will be in proportion to our utility of this 'information'. With the wheel people could travel faster to exchange goods, services, teaching, information. With the printing press this capacity scaled up a level birthing the rennaissance and the individualised and individuating human consciousness, the micro-daddy of scientific materialism. Now with the internet our capacity to exchange information has been scaled up to a degree synonymous with the birth of language. Change is accelerating as we connect and share our information. The old power structures of hierarchy, firmly established upon the temple of individuation, specialization, and singular concentration have found their position suddenly threatened...worse, the empire is crumbling. The misunderstanding of the purpose and function of individuation born of the scientific method, mechanised by the industrial/technological capacities that ensued, and birthing 'mother' of the misconcpetion of the accumulatory libertarian has come full circle in the rebirth of a homo-globalis.<em> \"The internet is here\"</em>.\n\nIn Ireland it is difficult to approach the old worldview holders with the message of the new. Generations of education at the abusive hands of the Roman Catholic Institution has all but utterly destroyed the viability of a sense of entitlement in our society. Clear ideas are judged and suppressed before given space and time to blossom. This creates problems. The doors of our youth caf\u00e9 'The Spot' opened last december. We had formed an unholy alliance with For\u00f3ige, a national youth organization famous for their understated association with the RCI (see above) in Ireland. We had the local support, this much was clear, 1500 people joined the facebook page that started the response action within one week...and this of a town of 4500 people. We needed a building, and For\u00f3ige also wanted to relocate from their space in the town which was set up to run the Garda Sub Project where For\u00f3ige work with young offenders in the town. Our fledgeling orgnization, without viable entitlement of its own, took legitimization by this association to an established institution. We organized funding from the Offaly enterprise board. On the condition of raising 25% we would be funded the remainder of the complete sum. Under the auspices of working for the community, to create a better situation for the youth community there we raised 12,500\u20ac in a short time and filed application to the enterprise board. On receipt of funding we completed renovations and moved into the property.\n\nIn a meeting with the For\u00f3ige official shortly after opening, members of our board of management, including the woman who started the project with the facebook page having had familial experience of the tragic nature of suicide, were told \"You have built us a new office and sitting room and now we have to let you sit in it sometimes\". Our hopes of support in our work were slightly damaged by this remark, as you can imagine. But only momentarily. I had also met with the same For\u00f3ige officer, head of the Offaly area, to propose a new initiative to create an online network of Irish youth caf\u00e9s so that the youth could have a hub online from which to organize and schedule their own events, create meetings, organize their own workshops and to create a connective space online where crowd-induced-innovation could work to generate from among their best and brightest a better and increasingly self-selective and stigmergic mode of activity. His response was ironically typical of the institution for which he indirectly functioned: \"We wouldn't want to give the wrong kind of people access to children\".\n\nDivide and conquer comes, as all things do, with a natural and equal opposite. To each 'solv\u00e9' there is 'coagula'. To connect and empower has always been the understated work of social innovations. It would seem that while 'man' has 'his' ideas, consciousness has other plans. Our successes in the coming time will come from our ability to recognise this and work in accordance with it. I wish us many such successes. Unfortunately, if we go the route of specifically 'human' failing by choosing to try to counter the evidenced and true spirit of the time we are bound, on chaotic waves for shallow and rocky waters.\n\nWhile in India getting treatment for a sickness I developed through imbalance in Europe I forged some connections with local NGOs in the Rajastani province. I connected with artists and youth groups, tradespeople and many individuals. Looking at the society there, in the textile and trading towns especially, it became clear that the west bleeds the East of its value. We buy cheap and sell expensive in accordance with the fidicuary duty by which we are 'legally bound' to our souless incorporated person-as-master. From streetside sellers to computer programmers of the best quality in the world, we outsource our consumptive needs to the east, raising our profit by their loss. It was so evident that I became stirred to use this mechanism\u00a0 as best as it could possibly be used.\n\nWe in Europe are now facing 'austerity'. This is in part due to the actions of the stakeholder interest in the EU, of private entities in receipt of more than four times the EU's annual GDP in private profits, private enterprises which were themselves seeded by european funding to begin with. The tail is most definately wagging the dog, this much is beyond doubt. Also beyond doubt is the illusory nature of the global financial system and the threat posed by our misled tendence toward our own consumptive destruction. The system requires a ReseT.\n\nLooking at the growth of youth caf\u00e9s in Ireland it was clear that they could be connected. There is at least one in every county and by linking them they can obviously reduce costs by sheduling tours of classes, group trips and so on. It is clear that the action makes sense, irrespective of the fears stated by For\u00f3ige. Fears get often get in the way of doing what is right. In India I purchased, at a fair price, goods to the tune of some 72 kilos. Inside were khadi schoolbags (1.50\u20ac) many note books from small and handmande recycled paper (10cents) to large leatherbound with prints (3.00\u20ac). cards, bookmarkers, furnishings for the youth cafe, beanbags, wall hangings etc, and a number of cultural art-works from local artist\u00a0 'Kikasso' with whom I conducted a video interview and agreed on a Skype meeting for the Irish debut exhibition and sale of his work. In total I invested 400\u20ac. I posted with a shipping company and to date nothing has arrived. It is almost one year now...I am not hopeful however I am told that one can be surprised in such situations.\n\nI am not taken back by this...it didn't work out. That doesn't mean it won't work. A \u20ac3 schoolbag, indeed all cheap functional goods fit to need and purpose will find a buyer. Because we are an NPO we would not pay taxes at customs for the goods by virtue of Irish tax law. The profit involved is about 900% and this is selling the goods very cheaply. The aim is to use this innovation to have a dual effect. In the west our poorest are still wealthy by developing standards. The poor by working with the poor can leveage their respective transnational situations and find economic relief which can enable their focus and creating a better life for themselves and their families and by supplying their need with cost effective and easy solutions.\u00a0 It may not have worked out this time. But this model will work, and due to the vast disparency between economic conditions the model will work toward creating a balance in the lives of our respective sociaties bringing our people in Ireland a little further out of the reach of the stresses related to poverty and providing services and experiences through funding which otherwise would be unavailable.

It is a way to show people that energy convservation applies equally to a symbol of value as it does to any other form of energy. More in one place means less in another due to the fact of this conservation...<em>\"it is not right to want what another cannot have by virtue of their own labour and effort\"</em>.\n\nYou may ask what comes of this for me? It is part of a self-centred notion of consciousness that this question\u00a0 always comes first to mind, this is 'normal' to the mindset produced in the west. I teach dance, object manipulation of all kinds, basic beatboxing and freestyle rap...anything I think resonates with the young will to creation, I have enough to survive, my connection with thee material world is tenuous at best and so I don't need much. It would help to have enough to ensure that efforts are not dwindled in obscurity or missed on account of insufficient challenge, but what can I ask for knowing the condition others live in? I read somewhere that giving a child a toy to play with can make the difference between a life and no life. This is true, and we don't need material toys, we have bodies and minds and great spirit. The problem is we often don't recognise it in ourselves...it is reflected in our interactions with others,<span> one</span><em> Self inter esse reflecting. </em>(inter='between' , esse='beings') Many hands make Light work. I thought I misunderstood when someone told me this meant that a heavy thing is made light by many people attending to it.

Note that going through the Economy App network barter code that we released so far is not a worthy investment at the moment: that code is our first (working, but really slow) prototype. We later implemented a much more mature version. Now my teammate Daniel is finishing the interface and implementation of that implementation, and we will release that code open source again when we're done with it (ask me in at most four weeks if I forgot).\n\nSome initial feedback for the ideas you have:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Trust building mechanisms.</strong> As I understand it, you propose an advanced and efficient system for gauging and building up of trust for trading. That sounds promising, since we definitely need a trust-building mechanism in Economy App (and so far only use a \"one to five star\" scoring of sales, similar to how they do on ebay.com). The simple star-based mechanism of course has the advantage of being ... well, simple ... saving the users from needing to learn any new concept (which would hinder voluntary adoption of the software). But explaining a feature is of course also something about a good user interface. So if you have ideas / sketches for the user perspective of the automated trust building feature, I'd be really interested :)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Vouchers.</strong> Your idea would indeed solve the issue of wanting a security until the shipment arrives, and also the additional problem of how to handle product returns. (Because for B2C sales over the Internet, the option of returning a product for any reason is mandatory in most European countries. Which is a big issue, as we don't want to, and can't, reverse a whole loop / network barter deal with maybe 60-100 people on average just because <em>one</em> person wants to return their stuff.) However, adding currency again into the equation (or trust-based P2P debt) also creates new problems. Some of which I found out about when doing the interview \"<a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/interview-struggling-with-crisis-in-spain\">Mental and cultural aspects of struggling with the crisis in Spain</a>\" on my blog. Means, debt between people knowing each other can be a cultural no-go, and local currencies can be an issue for voluntary adoption of a new software again. Anyway, I'd like to hear your opinion if and how one could route around these issues using your idea of vouchers.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Voucher, again.</strong> Just remebered that we also thought about vouchers lately, resulting in a proposal for a feature in a later version. I am just going to copy&amp;paste the feature proposal here, hope it's understanable with so little context, and maybe it inspires some more ideas in you (let me know!):\n\n<em><u>Vouchers, to redeem in brick-and-mortar shops.</u> The brick-and-mortar shop would offer vouchers for sale on the online barter platform, and customers can purchase them as usual, either completely in barter or partially in money (and even the latter is attractive compared to buying in the shop for all in money).\n\nThe special thing about these vouchers is that they are treated as fluid (non-atomic) products, and thus can be used by the deal finder as \"filler\" material, leading to more deals being found. This also means, however, that there indeed has to be a special feature for this: the individual transactions should not be a voucher each as they are possibly just cent amuounts, but the user should be able to obtain vouchers from this \"accounting\" system in desired amounts, to spend when shopping. These vouchers would use QR codes or similar technology to be redeemable automatically at POS terminals in the shop. They could also be cryptographically signed by the issuing shop (using an API call to the shop's website, which also would track balances of the shop's barter customers and would confirm with the signature that the customer is eligible to this voucher).\n\nThe vouchers would be spent by showing a printed version at a POS terminal, or by generating a voucher exactly for the payable amount right on spot, then showing it on the smartphone's screen to be scanned at the POS terminal.\n\nIn effect, these vouchers enable buy-now purchases in brick-and-mortar shops. And that in a better way than when using the \"buy-now, partially in money\" on a smartphone right in the shop: because there, one never knows before what kidn of offer one will get, and a good offer (like: 90% in barter) that was available right before going to the shop can be gone when getting to the cashier. This unpredictability regarding how much money one will have to spend, combined with the need to spend at least some money in every purchase, makes this alternative impractical.</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOn another note, have you looked into <a href=\"https://ripple.com/users/\">Ripple</a> currency transaction system? Tech-wise, I find it very inspiring (and the only reason we decided for bartering instead was to work around the cultural implications of debt.) Ripple has a P2P trust system, expressed in credit lines with credit limits that you extend to your \"friends\" according to how much you trust them to pay you back. Using that system, any currency and other unit of value, including local currencies, can be routed across it. Before the current Ripple.com system got started, there was an open source project by the same name, with a very similar concept, now known as <a href=\"https://classic.ripplepay.com/\">Ripple Classic</a>. If you want to experiment with Ripple.com, let me know and I'll send you 30 XRP for free.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-28 23:50:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:40.503522", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1010, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1675], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22712, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1245, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>Moi-nous</b>\n\nI really like your \u201cWE\u201d.\n\nI use a different word, 'oneness'.

Where I can from, as late as the 1950s the mythical (communist) mayor of Modena <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfeo_Corassori\">Alfeo Corassor</a>i engaged in a textbook regulation activity (no public money was spent) in the face of huge unemployment. Here is the story in a nutshell: Modena (small city of 180,000) ended the war with an economy dominated by large companies that did most of their business working for the military. With peace, their business vanished overnight and the workers found themselves unemployed. Corassori and his collaborators bought agricultural lands (against loans); urnbanized them (town planning regulation now allowed construction of buildings) and sold it back \u2013 way under market price \u2013 to small entrepreneurs wishing to acquire a workshop-plus-home situation, which was the kind of building allowed by the regulation. Even if cheap, urbanized land was more expensive than agricultural land, and this allowed the Town Hall to repay its initial investment. Thus Villaggio Artigiano Modena Ovest was born (<a href=\"http://www.villaggioartigianomodena.it/index.php/il-progetto/ieri/la-storia/\">history</a>, Italian), soon to be imitated all over my native Emilia Romagna region.\n\nCorassori did not really find small entrepreneurs. He seems to have created some. Legend has it that he showed up in person at the home of skilled factory workers, made unemployed by the implosion of the large military contractors, and told them more or less \"You've got the skills, the brains and the integrity. We believe you can succeed in starting your own business. So do it!\".\n\nAnd now, my home office in Brussels is a variant of the same concept \u2013 less the inspired town planning!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-06 07:04:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.842426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23084], "is_liked_by": [115, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31948, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Heads up: travelling on the 19th</b>\n\nNo flight from BXL on the 20th!

Some concepts that could be useful for you for the \"We live here\" project.\n\nIn my previous comment I already critizised the notion of \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\". I feel they do not describe very well the \"reality\" of participation, as they say something about who is the leading organiser of an exercise (or the one paying the bills :-) ), but not much about its nature.\n\nI think the notion of \"top-down\" vs. \"bottom-up\" could be complemented with the notions of \"inside out\" vs. \"outside in\", which somehow suggest the intrinsic logic that characterize a participatory process or initiative. The first case: \"inside-out\" would refer to the usual PR (Public Relationships) Participatory exercises, where those who have power, the ones \"inside\", are \"going out\" for a while to interact a little with the rest, hear a bit, say a lot, pretend to care, get legitimation, influence... but then come back in, where the logic of power and decision making hasn't changed. And then... the decissions are taken, in most cases, the ones that were already planned.\n\n\"Outside-in\" refers to the case where you make the frontiers \"porous\", to allow those outside to get access to the political structures. We are thus speaking of real processes of \"political development\" <em>-understood as \u201can interactive, public decision-making and learning process, within and between government and civil society, based on power creation and dispersion\u201d [1]</em>, a process that usually only happens when an important share of the elites realises that it is in their own interest to progressively incorporate into decision-making some previously excluded groups, as a way to create the new forms of \u2018shared power\u2019 deemed necessary to cope with societal challenges.\n\nThis is a view of civic engagement that is really oriented toward inclusiveness. You are bringing in those that are out. Not necessarily they are to stay there, or take the decisions... but since you are inviting them, and they are able to see the way it looks \"inside\"... it is not that easy just to do 'whatever', once the participatory process is considered finished.\n\nWell, I am just thinking out loud. :-) But somehow... what characterizes \"Edge-Ryders\" is precisely that it has an \"Outside-\u00edn\" approach. The EU is inviting outsiders, edgeryders... to come in and eat with them. Let's hope the project ends as a big success and it triggers some \"political development\" in the EU... because it is much needed!\n\nYou mentioned, Anthony, the term \"middle-out\". Somehow... again making a joke like that \"from-the-middle-and-around\", we could think of \"Inside &amp; outside to the middle\" :-).\n\nSo... I think I wrote already too much.

I don't think I have read anything by you before. You make some excellent points, particularly that of artists sharing some of those stress-inducing working conditions with non-artists. You mention art workers; where I come from (Italy) there is similar talk around freelancers.\u00a0\n\nTrained as an economist, having been a professional musician for several years in the 1990s, I looked up economic literature about the arts. The intuition most relevant to your point (and the whole thread) is this: art is defined by economies of scale in consumption. It works like this. Imagine you like classic two guitars-bass-drums rock music. Well, that technology scales really well: you can enjoy a rock concert in a bar with an audience of 30 people, or in a football stadium with an audience of 80,000. The costs of giving a concert increases in the size of the audience, but much slower than the ticket revenues. If you double your audience, your profit does not double: it goes up fourfold, or even tenfold, depends on where you start. Markets with these characteristics are called winner-takes-it-all: they produce few superstars, with everyone else doing badly (Rosen's <a href=\"http://www.ppge.ufrgs.br/giacomo/arquivos/ecop72/rosen-1981.pdf\">classic 1981 paper</a>). While stars tend to be very talented people, it is simple to build a model that takes performers with\u00a0<em>identical</em>\u00a0characteristics, and then makes one or a few of them superstars, and discards the others. Initial lucky breaks are reinforced by the success-breeds-success dynamics. We need a hairdresser every ten blocks, because people go to different hairdressers. But very few stars, because we all watch/listen to/read the\u00a0<em>same\u00a0</em>ones.\n\nNow, you\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0do not want to work in a labour market that makes superstars. Whoever you are, probability says that you are almost certainly a loser in the race.\u00a0That's extremely stress inducing.\u00a0But artists do work there. And so do others, as you point out.\u00a0\n\nTentative conclusion. Maybe it's not creativity that is stressful: it's the characteristics of winner-takes-it-all\u00a0labor markets, including the one\u00a0for\u00a0artists. Implications: hard call. I fully appreciate that being creative in your spare time is limiting. But so is being poor, scared and stressed out. My own choice was relatively easy, given that I was obviously no artistic genius, and other things interested me just as much as music: I got the hell out of it after making it to midlevel (gold record in a secondary market such as Italy), but not to stardom\u00a0:-)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-08 18:04:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.948076", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 475, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32092], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29510, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4724, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Warming up together campaign</b>\n\nI'll just leave this here:\u00a0https://goo.gl/ZJ6PgI\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-26 15:08:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.457274", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4631, "user_id": 2703, "topic_id": 4598, "post_number": 1, "raw": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-BtrzYME2Y\n\n_Hello Guys,_\n\n_Let me share with you this case study: \"Zero Zbel Xperience\". Conducted by Mamoun Ghallab, a young moroccan entrepreneur 30 yo. He's now very famous among the youth of different neighborhoods in Casablanca. Every week he goes to a neighborhood and motivate young poeple and even families to reduce their domestic waste._\n\n_I let you discover his experience through this interview._\n\n\n### How did you start?\n\nZero Zbel Xperience (\"Zbel\" means \"Trash\" in Moroccan Arabic) is an initiative based on a personal challenge I launched the challenge of living by producing zero waste, and I gave myself five months to achieve that, between August and December 2013.\n\nZero Zbel Xperience was born from a simple observation: in Morocco there is no separate collection of waste, almost no recycling infrastructure and the waste ends up in nature or at best in uncontrolled dumps. Therefore, I have chosen to show how each citizen can act to its own level to contribute to the sustainable development of Morocco.\n\nSo I created a blog and my initiative relayed via social networks.\n\n\n### What is the current situation?\n\nZero Zbel Xperience has been underway since August 2013. The key project phase lasted six months, from August 2013 to January 2014, and since January 2014 the project and its results serve as tools for public awareness.\n\nFrom August 2013 to December 2013, I adopted the following approach:\n\nI started to weight my monthly \"usual\" waste production: In August 2013 I produced 12Kg of waste. Then I explored for 4 months the possibilities to reduce my waste. In December 2013, I weighed my garbage again to make a final diagnosis: after the experience I was producing more than 500 grams of household waste per month.\n\nThe solutions that I found concerning how to go shopping (avoid over-packaged products and find alternatives), reducing waste (including food), composting of organic waste (making a composter), manufacture of home hygiene products etc..\n\nIn addition, I wrote on my blog several articles on social issues related to waste: for example, made a report at the heart of the largest landfill in Morocco to highlight informal channels to manage our household waste.\n\nFrom January 2014, I basically responded to requests to give lectures and lead workshops.\n\nI also developed a repository for organizing events for a \"zero-waste\" process and a tool for assessing those events to deliver a \"zero waste label\". I thus voluntarily helped organize the first \"zero-waste\" event in Morocco with a group of 25 youth.\n\nThe results of the experience so far are:\n\nThrough this experience, I managed to reduce my production of 96% of household waste.\n\nAlso, in raising awareness, the results are:\n\n* My accounts on social networks are federated around 15000 regular followers;\n* I have published nearly 40 articles on my blog, which attracted 26,210 unique visitors;\n* Media benefits were as follows:\n\n    * About 20 articles (print and web)\n    * 4 passages on national radio\n\n* I speak regularly at conferences and workshops:\n\n    * Intervention at the TEDx conference Casablanca 2013 (video above)\n    * 5 lectures at universities in Morocco\n    * 3 interventions at the \"MEDCOP 21\" in Marseille in June 2015 (workshops and conferences)\n    * \"Sustainability Lab\": monthly workshops with NGOs enactus for capacity building of student groups bearers of social entrepreneurship project. The content of the workshop is inspired by the conclusions and philosophy of Zero Zbel Xperience\n\n* Contribution to the organization of the first \"zero waste\" event in Morocco: Casablanca TEDx 2015, the 3/26/2015 (600 participants).\n\n* Other ongoing collaborations around the \"Label Zero Zbel\"\n\n\n### Who is involved: Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skill levels, partnerships?\n\nI lead the project alone so far. Occasionally, I supported many people individually (logistics / technical support, consultancy etc ..) and some targeted partners such as:\n\n* Enactus Morocco: around \"Sustainability Labs\" mentioned above\n* TEDx Casablanca: Partner \"Label Zero Zbel\"\n\n\n### Short / Medium Term Projection: \"I believe that to achieve x, we must do it through z\"\n\nTo develop further  awareness actions, I think I should develop communication through videos media, Internet and why not through TV channels. For this I need a partner who can bring me the technical expertise to create videos.\n\nTo develop the \"Label Zero Zbel\" I am creating new partnerships:\n\n* Partnerships for artistic and cultural events are mostly for Moroccan associations;\n* Partnerships with enterprises, including a round tourism and sports a future major project in Marrakech now \"Surfin'Marrakech\".\n\nTo develop more partnerships, should increase the visibility of the label, including creating a dedicated website. Also, I plan to propose the \"Label Zbel Zero\" for the organization of MEDCOP 22 and COP 22 to be held in 2016 in Morocco.\n\n\n### What are your main goals / why you do this?\n\nInitially the objective this initiative was twofold:\n\n1. Prove that all Moroccans can reduce their production of household waste through simple gestures, even if there is no sorting or recycling channels organized in Morocco. For that it was necessary:\n\n    * Proving through concrete results that this approach is possible;\n    * Identify good and replicable practices adapted to the Moroccan context.\n\n2. Raise awareness about our environmental impact every day especially among young people, relying on the experience and its results conducted by young people.\n\nCurrently, to push the initiative further and expand beyond the simple individual practice, I developed a repository for  \"zero waste\" events, backed by a label: the \"Label Zero Zbel\" .\n\nMy current goal is to develop this label and maximum common use for various events.\n\n\n### What do you enjoy more about your job and what you like least?\n\nI lead this project because I am fascinated by the problem of awareness and respect for the environment because I am convinced that countries like Morocco must create their own models of development. The philosophy of Zero Zbel Xperience is to do is simply to seek palliative solutions to environmental problems, but rather to treat at the source. Priority is given to the impact reduction at the source, before looking for solutions to manage our negative externalities.\n\n\n### What types of tasks you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily\n\nI do not make special regular duties. I manage my blog and continuously associated pages on social networks, and work more intensely when I have to accompany such events or workshops.\n\n\n### What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?\n\nI would need partners to:\n\n* Legal support to formalize the registration Label and intellectual property issues related to it.\n* Development of awareness through video media\n* The development of a new website\n\n\n### What help can you give to others and under what conditions (assuming no money is involved)?\n\nAll I do about Zero Zbel Xperience is a volunteer job.\n\nI can bring my help to other non-profit organizations through sharing my expertise in environmental matters for example via a support and the adoption of an environmental impact reduction approach in the conduct of their business.\n\n\n### What do you produce / What is your offer?\n\nMy offer consists of the advising for the adoption of an environmental impact reduction approach, particularly around the issue of waste.\n\nI offer this service for free to NGOs and other non-profit organizations, and I could look forward to sell this service to companies for example.\n\n\n### Products or services you produce now?\n\nI produced a repository of best practices for the adoption of a \"zero waste\" approach and an evaluation grid for awarding the Label \"Zero Zbel\".\n\nI also offer to my partners more visibility about my actions via my blog and my social networks.\n\n\n### How are you going to lead your project? What are the steps? Technologies or processes used?\n\nThe next steps are:\n\n1. Develop necessary partnerships for:\n\n    * legal support to formalize the registration of the Label and intellectual property issues related to it.\n    * the development of media awareness video\n    * the development of a new website\n\n2. Launch of a new awareness campaign web\n\n3. Propose the label to new organisms to generalize to the maximum zero waste approach\n\n\n### Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work? Which currently supports, how and why?\n\nUntil now the costs are minimal and I take care of them by myself.\n\n\n### Existing Alternatives: Who else is doing similar or related work / offering similar things- locally or elsewhere?\n\nLocally, no other kind of label exists.\n\n\n### Significant actors that affect your work? (Local and International)\n\nNone\n\n\n### Long-term perspective: a business or sustainability plan?\n\nShort term: I am currently conducting administrative procedures for the formal establishment of the Zero Zbel Association. This will further formalize the framework.\n\nMedium term: A partnership with the Ministry of Environment for generalized zero waste approach to all official events is the best way to ensure broad impact and legitimacy of a good label.\n\n\n### Transport and logistics?\n\nNone\n\n\n### Law and policy directly or indirectly affecting your work?\n\nNone\n\n\n### What is the concept of pooling resources mean to you? Also on the concepts of collaboration and mutual support?\n\nMy entire action is based on sharing, collaboration and sharing of individual efforts to generate a positive impact for all.\n\nThe essence of the message of Zero Zbel Xperience is that convergence of small positive individual actions can be a radical solution to serious problems such as waste management in Morocco. Citizens have the power to change things on their own, it suffices to show that change is possible and that it is beneficial for all.", "created_at": "2015-06-27 13:12:19", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 16:17:22.079519", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1577, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 216.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 1935, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1262, "user_id": 267, "topic_id": 1229, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I've always been curious. <span>Intellectually curious. </span><span>Find out how reality works, understand the laws and mechanisms, reassemble the pieces to build new and present new future.</span>\n\n<span>But the theory of reality is very different from its practice.</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/ff7117f7d4ffded4cda31122f0a37f370b147ea4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n<span>A model student until college I spent years and years before obtain the degree, at the ripe age of 35 years. </span><span>Almost all my fault, but still I cannot understand the real cause. </span><span>Maybe it has to do the university environment, archaic, old style even if rigorous and valid. </span><span>Electronic engineering is not experienced as a continual discovery but as a series of increasingly difficult obstacles to overcome.</span>\n\n<span>Maybe depression has to do. </span><span>Perhaps one cause, perhaps an effect.</span>\n\n<span>At 33 years, two exams after graduation, change of university, the same city, Rome, but a different way, closer to my ideal, to learn and experiment.</span><span>Eight examinations in a year and a half, scoring very high degree. </span><span>Oh well. </span><span>But perhaps I need to change first.</span>\n\n<span>In the meantime, I collaborate with an international festival of independent cinema. </span><span>Experiences and knowledge that are mixed, the feeling of being useful.</span>\n\n<span>After graduation, I know it's late for me. </span><span>Some experience in software houses, a stage for the APAT (Governmental Agency</span> for Environmental Protection).\n\n<span>But my desire is to work by exploiting my hunger for knowledge, my willingness to hybridize technology, science, art and culture. </span><span>I read. </span><span>I enjoy reading. </span><span>Fiction, poetry, essays. </span><span>From Balzac to astrophysics, from Lernet-Holenia to neuroscience, from Keats to palaeontology, by Stieg Larsson to the theory of networks.</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/583ea7107384071cb6c2cb05384593c441f5cdb7.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\"><br>\n\n<span>In 2006 I opened a blog, I began to study and observe observe the Web, its dynamics, its philosophies, its instruments. </span><span>I like the universe of possibilities it offers, the ability of interaction that allows people introverted like me.</span>\n\n<span><span>I find</span> <span>the strength</span>, <span>the charm</span> and the </span><span><span>potentiality</span></span><span> <span>of the</span> <span>communities</span> <span>thanks to the experience</span> <span>of <a href=\"http://progettokublai.ning.com/\">Kublai</a></span></span>, an initiative of the Italian Ministry of\n\nEconomic Development - Department of Development Policies.

We started looking into care beccause, frankly, it keeps getting in the way. We\u00a0are always trying to build something (an online community, a consulting business, a space for life and work... ). Building is hard, and normally underpaid because no one wants to pay for the costs of coordination and the risk-taking phase when you are building, but the thing you are building is not yielding its expected benefit because it's not finished. So people keep burning out, or having to take long breaks, or otherwise dropping the ball. That affects everyone else, is unfair on the tougher people who keep grinding it with less support, and fragilises everything we do.\u00a0\n\nThis is ust my own personal \u00a0take, mind you. But me, I am too much of an economist not to see the efficiency gains of involving everyone, being super-flexible as to the form in which different people contribute. The Reef has a calming, burnout-preventing\u00a0effect on us simply because being in one live-work place allows us to support each other in more ways. If I am exhausted, or pissed off, I can share whatever I do to flush the ad stuff out of my system: if I feel like cooking a meal I can offer you to cook for you too (or help me, if you feel like cooking too). If I feel lik going for \u00a0run or a long walk I can invite you. It costs exactly nothing. But occasionally it will be just what you need: taking a break, regenerating a bit. We have already noticed how we are working fewer hours, and cutting out exactly the worktime where we are most stressed or tired \u2013 the worktime that does not produce anything.

I have always been in the top 5% of my class, but mostly as a result of conformity and self-discipline. I always, unconsciously, knew I have to get somewhere. Which is why I tend to compare myself with who I was at a certain point in my past and with others in order to keep a record of where I am on the road to \u2026? And that precisely is my dilemma: on the road to what? </span>\n\n<span>After obtaining a BA in Communication and PR I started to analyze what I had been doing those years and what was it that I wanted to do next.  Once you graduate from university, people expect you to jump right into the market. It turned out the field simply did not suit me, for reasons it would take too long to enumerate here.  I figured a large part of my problem would be solved if I could just find what I really liked. So I decided, based on my extra-curricular activity, the fact that I was always being recruited by professors to work on projects, as well as based on the role models I have that I want to be a researcher, preferably an academic one, in political science. I learned how to analyze and integrate social data, I went to conferences, got in touch with scientific communities, wrote a nice MA thesis, but to be able to, for example, find out the calculus of voting, it takes decades and you risk of ending up being mediocre.  Anyway, embarking on that means I would have to get a PhD, start writing seriously and most importantly, publish! But like probably most things in life, I find out this is damn hard.</span><span> Especially if your standard for achievement is so high not even your professors meet it. So go find other models and an educational system that can push you where you think you want to be pushed. But that means calculating chances of getting in a prestigious university, competing with other people who in your mind are much brighter than you, and leaving behind other intimate aspirations. That is where I am now, attempting to make a decision: either being nothing but a professional with all my engines on and what I call home \u2013 the people I love, my hobbies and a comfortable life in which I perform little less than expected.</span>\n\n<span>In the meantime, I try to get around this using intermediate channels \u2013 voluntary work, internships \u2013 and building other types of experiences and relationships with work. But none of them are long term, so it is still me who has to decide eventually.</span><span> No matter how adulthood will turn out, I hope my transition will be a worthy one, but as seen through my own eyes and not the lens of a society based on all sorts of criteria \u2013 status, money etc.  My criteria at present is peacefulness of mind \u2013 a satisfactory balance between what I could have done and what I eventually did, with all compromises and regrets involved. Why aiming for that result? Because my mind wanders too much, I feel like I have to factor in all sorts of variables \u2013 personal aspirations, family background, societal context, opportunities, skills and experience I already accumulated and would not want to throw off the window for the UNKNOWN.. and that for me is the sweetness and sourness of transition. But at a certain point in life what I want is to only keep the sweetness and let go of sourness. </span>\n\n<span>Finally, I think this writing exercise is challenging because it requires introspection. Nonetheless, its effects can be highly rewarding because once you are done with it (the writing, that is, not the rest of it) you feel like you can officially begin to look for wonderful resources to help you learn how to make choices. I am here to do just that.</span>", "created_at": "2011-10-17 08:09:12", "updated_at": "2018-04-27 07:56:04.187838", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 755, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 40.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30168, "user_id": 119, "topic_id": 4748, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Some critique</b>\n\nBased on my personal experiences with these ideas, here are a few critiques:\n\n1. Do-ocracies are inherently dysfunctional\n\nIt's one of those ironic things that projects where you can \"work on whatever you think is important\" often are incredibly dysfunctional. You see enormous efforts strand somewhere 80% of the way to the ever elusive end-point. I think there are several reasons for this. Firstly, motivation is not equally distributed. Not in people and not in time. Which means that an \"ad-hocracy\" (which describes the situation more clearly IMHO) depends on people being motivated exactly enough at exactly the right time to be able to join specific (pivotal) moments. This means that people who arrive at the wrong time can be perceived as disruptive as they might \"just start doing things\", which might not be the unwritten group-consensus at that moment. Similarly, people who are for whatever reason (and this can be many things) not motivated properly when \"stuff gets going\" are left in the dust. You see these patterns in Edgeryders all the time btw.\n\nIf there is a clear external drive (e.g. financial motives as in Valve or perhaps a very clearly defined problem to solve, like the Manhattan project or building an off-ramp in Egypte), this might not be a big issue. However, if the goals are not 100% clear and fixed, then ad-hocracies tend to have an ever revolving door of disappointed volunteers/participants in its wake. Whoever does things not only determines what gets done and why it is important) but also when it starts and when it ends. The natural end of adhocracies is, when the people that do get \"tired of it\", and please \"can someone take over\". Because the underlying dynamic is that those \"people that do\" are essentially constructing exclusionary mechanisms all the time.\n\nAnother \"solution\" is to fix the starting point and motivation required to join (e.g. Burning Man), so at least people start off at the same moment with similar motivations.\n\n2. Rhetorical rationality is super-hard\n\nHumans are emotional animals. This is perhaps a clich\u00e9, but no less true and highly relevant in this context. What I've seen again and again is that cognitive biases, emotional thinking and the like are way more difficult to avoid than most rational thinkers want to admit. (I say this as a self-identifying rationalist.) The expressed wish to remove rhetorical fallacies from speech is certainly recommendable, but it is an incredibly small minority position. \u00a0The vast majority of people don't even have a clue what you are talking about, as they live in a world where rhetorical fallacies are the norm, rather than the exception. If you don't believe that, watch TV for an hour.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if \"ideal speech\" is - at the moment - attainable at all in any random organisation. Perhaps if it can be supported with fairly intensive classes on psychology and logic. I'm not sure if that is the goal of most organisations (\"point of human interaction\"), to be philosopher schools. Which in a sense, most monasteries certainly are.\u00a0Incidentally, a recent philosophy weekend was the first time where I've seen a true effort to approach \"ideal speech\", but even there, with highly trained and experienced philosophers, it wasn't 100%.\n\nThe second critique is that \"ideal speech\" requires quite strong mental faculties. Logical thinking is most of the time not intuitive at all and once you get to Bayesian logic, you've lost at least 80% of the population. So, in that sense, it is also an exclusionary mechanism. Of course, this is less of a problem if you only want smart people to interact with anyway and don't really care about the threshold to get in (example: ccc conferences). But it certainly makes the protocol fail for most organisations you see, where it would literally decimate their size.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-05 10:24:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.153388", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 682, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21379, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 4748, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Thanks Alberto:\n\nGot your invite into this\u00a0<a href=\"/t/process-map-2-generating-protocol/4266/5\">here</a>.\u00a0on a previous protocol mention, but any response\u00a0belongs in direct connection to this one.\n\nI quote your final paragraph in an attempt to weave two threads into one and\u00a0climb aboard in one place:\u00a0\n\n<em>Where we depart is mostly in that I emphasise interdependence from future and potential brethren, whereas most Matera veterans draw a line at the House and at the people who they can speak to over breakfast.

(little winky face thing here)\n\nI'd agree with you totally about unMonasticism starting with embracing a visionary behaviour, and that this is\u00a0definitely\u00a0nothing akin to an automatic membership in a\u00a0club as seems vulgarly celebrated by some of the colourful riff-raff that you (singularly) 've saddled me with \u00a0!!! \u00a0 If I appear to be on another side of some fence, it is perhaps because what I do is support the guys in the field no matter how stupid, soporifically slow, or wrong they may be. \u00a0This, I feel, is not your fort\u00e9 : (the impatience that accompanies being a genius ? little face thingy \\#2 - see below on ER constitutional flaw) \u00a0 That I start with this is perhaps because I\u00a0am\u00a0in the field, but more because it is my discipline, I work overly patiently with (often hopeless) people.\n\n<span>----\n\nYour breakdown of unMon operating principles is great fun.\u00a0 You flagged a while back that you had reduced the mass of considerations down to three key lines; I had thought to send an inquiry at the time as in the backspin of writing the Code/unCode document (our best yet), I\u2019d been tempted to scrawl out my grand list of essentials as an undeniable nineteen basics. \u00a0(Not that I'd remember a single one off the top of my head.) \u00a0These have remained under wraps. \u00a0A tricky moment for me has always hampered the process since pre-Matera: \u00a0I find it imperialistic to reveal my personal version of Rule; \u00a0I somehow want these things to be self-evident.\u00a0 I could play: \"I\u2019ll show you mine, you show me yours.\" - but recognise that to dare to publish even a modest 0.1 requires considerable bravery.</span>\n\n<span>I like the way you have consistently brandished the Protocol term - the fruits you gather are an example of what I call mining the metaphor -- enlightening as long you keep your eye upon the tenuousness of the initial equivalence.\u00a0 \u00a0I have long resisted this language because protocol does not resonate in the same realm for me as it does for say a programmer.\u00a0 I get caught up in the\u00a0<em>etiquette of international diplomacy</em>, and find the very idea stifling.\u00a0 Attempting to get to the bottom of your usage, I ran it by a professor friend in the concrete sciences; she sketched the binary choices model that feeds your usage. \u00a0I\u2019ll likely stick with Code as it implies personal alignment with honour and ethics -- not the least scientific, and mired forever in human foible, as they may be.\u00a0</span>\n\nThe flaw, of course, with Do-ism is when one is or seems to be acting on behalf of a \u2018we\u2019.\u00a0 He/she who does the work can call the shots on behalf of a great many people and create much discord. \u00a0Matera certainly suffered from thinly considered solo initiatives. \u00a0The balancing mechanism is the ability to listen -- this is a lost art etc. and takes infinite patience - the herd moving only marginally faster than its slowest straggler gets somewhere by allowing some members to be eaten.\u00a0 But in a humanistic community we don\u2019t really like the idea of cannibalism - one of our interviewed monks quotes Benedict on the wisdom of listening to the novices.\n\n<span>There is also such a thing as a\u00a0<em>/chronic doers syndrome/</em>, this is often accompanied by a propensity for calling shots.\u00a0 Suffers don\u2019t usually exhibit large amounts of patience for the meditative contribution of group process; to them it feels like cloying inertia.\u00a0 One of the key flaws in the Edgeryders set up is that most of us grew up being by and large the smartest person in the room at any given moment.\u00a0 This is inconvenient to say the least; it leaves us with diminished social skills.\u00a0 I bestow my presence upon them that would benefit from my wisdom - we needn\u2019t place ourselves in the position of learners, and have more than enough stimulus from the fireworks exploding in our own brains. \u00a0 But the active people are dependent upon filling the holes in their genius from the back - this requires more strategy and feedback mechanisms than applying yet more Doing...</span>\n\n<span>You\u2019ve covered some of this with being open to openness.\u00a0 But what this may boil down to is a capacity to being open about other people being less open than you\u2019d ideally like.\u00a0 A mechanistic declaration of openness becomes in practice rhetorical.\u00a0 The real work is to factor in whole, fallible people in your programming.</span>\n\nUsing truths to negotiate\u00a0<em>working</em>\u00a0together is one thing, but unMonks also live together. Truths in themselves can become pretty useless. \u00a0Revealed truths are something else again; but these need constant renewal.\u00a0 The feedback loop that is required is that\u00a0<strong>which can keep doing and shot calling choral</strong>.\u00a0 Father Chelsom said as much in your interview with him; in response to Maria\u2019s question about the function of the Rule, he said to support long term harmonious living.\u00a0 As I recall, he pooh-poohed our chances.\n\nTo program harmony will require us to dig deeper.\u00a0 There can be no unMonastery for Dummies.\u00a0\n\nIn my report of the post-Matera \u201cWanderings\u201d, I put it this way:\n\n<em>A protocol that supports *\u2018il nostro duro lavoro\u2019*, a life of service and an unCivilisation regime will have at least two sides.\u00a0 Part of it can be interpreted as constraints: *don\u2019t annoy people.*\u00a0 However, it is not an elaborate slight of hand to reverse these prohibitions; to read the same directions as how to best support one another\u2019s reemergence from a life of urban subjugation : *enjoy each other inordinately* (in a non-annoying manner.)</em>\n\nWithout challenging self-sacrifice, without renegotiating of the chemistry and rhythms of civilisation, without the visceral enrichment of spiritual camaraderie our circles will remain cramped and disheveled. \u00a0\n\n\"&gt;more later...\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-22 19:16:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.885502", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1364, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1038, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1005, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>#SC4SV is a global network investing time and specialized skills into enabling new projects when capital is scarce.</em>\n\n<strong>What is it?</strong>\n\nThe SC4SE fund is the EdgeRyders network acting as a capital fund. By putting time and specialized skills (like language or design skills) at the disposal of new small enterprises, we take what we have (skills, time and talent) and use it to fill in the gaps left by what we don\u2019t have: access to investments of financial capital. This is self-help into employment for a largely unfunded generation. We can help each other to help ourselves. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>Why is it innovative? </strong>\n\nTime banks encourage members to exchange labour. In these systems, participants\u2019 \u00a0time is used as \u201ccash\u201d - as an alternative to currency for small transactions. To the best of our knowledge, the transformative steps to turn participant commitments into a capital resource have never been taken.\n\nWe ask our participants to commit a few days per year to the SC4SE fund. This time is pre-committed to the fund; That means the fund can value the assets given to it, and assure the enterprises it grants support to that they will get the help they need to get off the ground, unlike time banks which require continual fundraising efforts.\n\nA SC4SE Grant consists of a given number working hours. Participants from our network collaborate to self-organize this support in the form most useful to the enterprise. Typical uses might be design, translation or project communications review. It could also be used for remote jobs like scouting locations or giving presentations in a faraway city when funding is too scarce to travel there yourself.\n\n<strong>How will it have an impact? How could we measure impact? </strong>\n\nPlease explain how your idea will have an impact on helping target people/groups move towards work or into new types of work. What is it about your idea that will achieve this? Please also explain how you will measure the impact?\n\nPlease provide your definition of your target group.\n\nOur measurable impact is creating jobs and projects which provide social benefit and employment. We can measure three things easily.\n\n1) The total number of hours committed to the SC4SE fund (the size of the fund)\n\n2) The number of hours of labour performed in support of our supported projects (the total of grants made)\n\n3) The number of jobs created (and other metrics as measured by these projects) by projects we choose to fund (the outcomes)\n\nHow much contribution the SC4SE fund makes to the success of a project it invests in is harder to measure. If a project had 10000 EUR of financial capital and 20 person-days of time donated, is a fair representation 1 person-day is worth 200 EUR so 4000 EUR of labour is 40% of the enterprise\u2019s initial capital?\n\nFor some classes of participant work (for example, translation) it might make sense to value the time relative to equivalent commercial services in this way. In other areas, where specialized resources like access to networks and deep knowledge of a local area are invested, the value might be harder to assess accurately. In those cases we could estimate of the financial value required to replicate the work done by our participants.\n\nOur target group is entrepreneurs, particularly social entrepreneurs, within Europe who cannot fund their new enterprises because of capital scarcity driven by the ongoing financial crisis. We would expect many of these entrepreneurs to be young. We would also expect many potential entrepreneurs to become active once the SC4SE fund allows them to prototype their ideas without too much reliance on banking credit.\n\nThe successful ones will, of course, tend to employ additional staff as their enterprises grow, yielding a second-order impact.\n\n<strong>At what scale will the idea operate initially and what are our aspirations for the idea in the longer term?</strong>\n\nThe idea operates on a pan-European basis as the EdgeRyders network has active participants in most EU member states. However, the decentralized nature of that network means that the majority of work we can undertake for enterprises we support must be performed remotely: translation, proposal writing, graphic design, software development, accounting etc.\n\nAs the EdgeRyders SC4SE Fund grows in size, it will become increasingly possible to pair entrepreneurs with help in their area.\n\nWe think it is very clear that the substitution of social capital for financial capital is going to be a trend long into the future. The \u201ccrowdfunding\u201d efforts like KickStarter have shown what a little financial support from a lot of people can achieve, but many of the most active young people don\u2019t have enough capital to support all the projects they would like to.\n\nWith 20% youth unemployment in many areas, one resource we do have is time. Turning time into employment is something of an alchemical miracle: we take what we have (young people with skills) into what we need (self-supporting projects.)\n\nDifferent kinds of co-support networks could easily grow up on the EdgeRyders SC4SE model, in specific geographies, or around specific kinds of support.\u00a0\n\n<strong>How could sc4sv be sustained over the next five years? </strong>\n\nPlease explain how you think your proposal can be sustained over a period of time. We are not expecting you to have a full plan for this yet. We are interested in what type of ideas you have to make sure that your idea continues to have big impact on helping people/groups moving towards work or into new types of work.\n\nThe SC4SV is inherently sustainable because it does not need a lot of money to run if the social contracts which haromise expectations and govern interactions between participants are solid. It really only needs means to exist for people to be able to invest in each other. As well as training and communication materials for member-driven outreach work.\n\n1) Decentralised structure in which operations mainly sustained and driven by community members for whom interests of the community are aligned with their personal intersts\n\n2) Fixed costs are tied to maintaining the online platform, social media presence and low-budget physical community events.\n\n3) Our network analytics data from year 1 of running Edgeryders indicate that fixed costs of managing the community do not scale with community growth.\n\nIn order to cover fixed costs we have been selling services of the distributed think tank of citizen experts and we can do more of same. Our idea is to fund the existence of a website and some community animaton with that revenue. The community currently consists of 1300 members (250 active): <a>http://goo.gl/y4xjL</a>. We intend on growing the community by an order of magnitude over the next three years.\n\n<strong>What are the most important things we need to have in place to make the idea happen? </strong>\n\n1. A functional, streamlined online platform. The EdgeRyders community has so far interacted through a platform deployed by the Council of Europe. With the end of the project (end 2012) it is transitioning onto a decentralised community-run space.\n\n2. A sustainable, fair, social contract. Great caution has to be exercised to make sure that unpaid volunteers coexist easily with paid staff members; that participants can move effortlessly from one role to the other; and that the resulting tidal pull does not break the community apart.\n\n3. A (small) amount of cash resources to seed outreach and propitiate interaction. Edgeryders has grown through steady work on social media: community members reshared website content, thereby driving website traffic and new signups. Two events (example: <a>http://epilogger.com/events/lotesxb</a>) have played a key role in cementing the community, driving buzz and harvesting ideas for social innovation initiatives (we know of at least three applications to this prize conceived at one of them). The cash prize would be treated as a seed grant to be matched with other sources of start-up funds. Given the distributed nature of Edgeryders and the social media traction of many of its members, crowdfunding is being considered.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-01-22 21:54:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:04.425813", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1424, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21148, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2830, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Still no joy?</b>\n\nOr have you posted somewhere else, <a href=\"/u/la_gaia\">@La_Gaia</a>?

Radical times call for radical solutions: unMonasterians practice lifestyle innovation to be able to support ourselves and our peers in \u00a0helping communities unlock their transformative potential and surface hidden, underutilised or wasted resources. \u00a0Regardless of whether the market recognises and acknowledges the value of our skills and positive contributions to helping our communities adapt.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nThe project is unique in that it draws from a large pre-established network of highly skilled and motivated individuals known as EdgeRyders. Edgeryders is an international community \u00a0of more than 1300 members \u00a0(of whom 150 are very active) that assembled itself in 2011 as a \u201cdistributed think tank\u201d of citizen experts advising the Council of Europe on European youth policy.</span>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6822247540112585\"><span>How will your idea have an impact?

The activities begun may continue in the hands of the local people alone, or new ideas may have begun to develop for a new wave of activities.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Impact will be measured using the \u2018prove and improve\u2019 model outlined by the New Economics Foundation. Impact must be understood in terms of the needs of the community, defining areas of potential impact. The unMonastery can then draw on a range of tools and measures, to tap into constructs such as wellbeing, social connectivity, skills development, enhancement of local social assets, and communal sense of purpose. Where possible, baseline measures will be taken.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Example:</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>One prospective location for the first unMonastery is Matera, in Italy. In this example a number of key social and infrastructural problems/opportunities have already been identified. Including the two highest costs to the local authorities; poor urban hygiene and a high population of stray dogs. In these cases the unMonastery would gauge its impact by reducing or eliminating these costs in real terms.\u00a0In considering potential innovations, unMonasterians will look to local conditions - such as Matera\u2019s large natural reserves of limestone and natural water - \u00a0to bolster the development of solutions to known problems. In examples such as this we will measure our impact by local residents\u2019 ability to replicate the innovations made on an ongoing basis.</span>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6822247540112585\"><span>At what scale will your idea operate initially and how do you think it can be implemented in another EU member state in the future? </span></b><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>This initial iteration will pilot the concept with a group of 10-20 core team members, plus additional short term residencies to support the core-team throughout the 6-12 month period. Providing the pilot is a success the intention is to continue for a further 12 months.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nThe unMonastery is structured conceptually with a view to being reproduced, the first month of the project is earmarked exclusively as a listening period, in which dinners and events will be hosted for the benefit of (and to meet) the surrounding community. In order to build strong ties with community leaders and develop a mature understanding for needs or social problems relative to a specific area, prior to proposing any interventions, this approach of not announcing a solution prematurely will ensure the project can \u00a0be adapted to any given locality.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nAfter 6 months, a selection of the core team will visit other towns and cities to produce scoping reports for new prospective sites. The unMonastery as a concept is designed to work best when there\u2019s more than one in existence so as to allow for the circulation of skills and working solutions to be enacted throughout a network of buildings and localised communities across Europe.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6822247540112585\"><span>How do you think your idea could be sustained over the next five years? </span></b><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The primary skillset the unMonastery is designed to develop is resilience, in its myriad of forms. The true litmus test for any unMonastery is it\u2019s ability to establish autonomy and self sustaining infrastructure during the first 18 months of its development. This form of resilience focuses on both infrastructural utility in the form of solar, water collection, permaculture, urban farming and other appropriate technologies, as well as effective governance models and community activities for building sustainable and resilient cohesion for the locality each unMonastery finds itself in.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nThe intention is to export and share the techniques \u00a0learned so that not only is the unMonastery effective and resilient as a reproducible model but that it gives to the community in which it\u2019s placed those same skills for dealing with unpredictable scenarios and ongoing sustainable methods of development.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nAt a very base level though, two issues raised earlier in this proposal are projected to rise significantly in the coming years; large amounts of unused or empty housing stock and a lack of provision for services due to cuts. In this context perhaps the more appropriate question is how will we sustain a decent quality of life without places like the unMonastery?</span>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6822247540112585\"><span>Please explain what you need to make your idea happen for example: money, office space, permissions, supporters or partners. </span></b><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>unMonastery has several fixed offers for buildings throughout Europe, as such the money awarded will be spent on these core areas: </span>\n\n<span>Telling the Story (est 3000) - We plan to create a \u00a0standalone website for telling the unMonastery\u2019s story as it develops with \u00a0videos, blogs and most importantly online courses to share the skills developed with a broader audience.</span>\n\n<span>Scoping Exercise (est 3000) - members from the core team will travel to prospective sites for 2 week periods to meet with local authorities to evaluate the viability of an unMonastery in proposed locations. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Network Support (2000) - as previously stated, unMonastery is a satellite project born from the EdgeRyders platform, the platform itself is currently transitioning from the Council of Europe to a decentralised community run server.

But I learned a point in the two job interviews that I ever had.\n\n<strong>Application story.</strong> It starts with me finding out a bit too late about that open position as IT and AV teaching aids technician in the computing center of an European university. It was just too late to send them my application in printed form, as desired - and I told myself, if the <em>computing center</em> does not take my e-mail application, they don't deserve their name and I won't want to work there. I also added a quick mindmap of ideas on how I thought to organize my future workplace.\n\n\u00a0 They accepted the deviant application indeed (point for them on my score!), and invited me to a face-to-face interview. There, to my horror, they took out my application <em>in printed out form</em>. I remember the moment of wanting to ask: \"You are a computing center, and this was once a <em>digital</em> document, right? So what?\" Lateron I got criticized for some impractical ideas on the midmap (me thinking \"Hey it's titled <em>brainstorming</em>, never heard about its difference to <em>plan</em>?\"). And finally, somebody complained about the small font size in the attached, now printed, mindmap PDF ... (me thinking \"Adobe Reader has zoom\"). In aspects of worktime and my proposal of combining job and a PhD program they were astonishingly flexible, however. Now I don't think that job a short interview helps any side very much, and proposed that I'd come one week for free to check out their company culture, and let them see what I can do. They said this could not be organized because of \"accident insurance issues\" ... well, that finally told me enough about their culture actually.\n\n\u00a0 I finally cancelled my application because the internal culture felt too inflexible and rigid after all. And I was confirmed three weeks later when I received a big letter from them, containing, lo and behold: <em>their printouts</em> of my application PDF. The trash bin would've been a better way for their relief ...\n\n<strong>How to test the employers.</strong> I did not have much of a hidden agenda with my digital application, attached mindmap, and internship proposal. But it all turned out in a way that taught me: such means are great to test your potential employer. Asking questions about company culture etc. in the interview does not help much - if they're after your qualification, they'll advertise their company to you. But challenge their behavior by the very style of your application, dare to deviate, and you will see from small natural reactions and insecurities how their mindset and the company culture is really working. You can test for several aspects, depending on your priorities. In my case, I checked how they deal with unconventional behavior, rule-breaking, and innovation. (Note, this procedure might not work if your only contact is with a human resources manager rather than your future supervisor.)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-17 14:00:49", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 07:18:14.355971", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 579, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20842, "user_id": 398, "topic_id": 1321, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Good to meet you :)</b>\n\nHi there Chara...\n\nFunny, is your name really Chara? In Gaelic this means 'friend'...very nice name!\n\nThanks for your message, its nice to meet someone here who has a wider eye for experiences outside of the box. Its a funny question...the one about what to be when one grows up. I had always thought <em>'I am what I am now, why would that be any different in the future?'</em> The human is a fully rounded being...rounded by each and every type of human experience, by all present and by all past and full of the evolving potentiality of an unlived future, if one can lease the small self in favour of the greater. Today, with specialization and the categorical method of verification adapted by the scientific materialist school of modern thought leads us to professionally categorize ourselves according to our activities. What if I do something else...am I a different person? Hahaha, of course not! Perhaps your taste for the new, and the different, and the inspiring comes from your deep seated knowledge of what it is to be as a conscious human being. There is a funny story about John Lennon:\n\n<em>When he was very young he asked his mother - \"What is the point of living?\" She told him, \"the point of living is to experience happyness\"...some years later in school the teacher asked young John \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" John said \"Happy\", the teacher replied \"I don't think you understand the question\" to which John replied \"I don't think you understand Life\"</em>\n\nAt the moment it is clear that the world is reviewing this core question of what it is to be? Is it an individuated experience or can it be something shared? Must we live as self-serving capitalists or is there a new uncategorical mode of life and behaviour that integrates enough working principles to properly serve all people within society. Of course there is this mode, it is nothing new, it is our human nature in its balanced form. If we understand our situation, between the individual will and the connective/collective experience then it becomes clear that to life a life of self-interest will be, and can be seen now as being a detrimental process if carried by the whole of humanity. we need to rediscover the true meaning of things...we can start at self-interest seeing as it is so fundamental to our motivation. Inter Esse means 'Between Beings' in latin and this is where the word interest comes from, something is of interest to us when it is held for consideration between us two, and so Self Inter Esse really means Self Between Beings and thus points to the actuality and the interpersonal responsibility we have as humans. There are old tribes from south America who used to greet each other with the statement ' I am another yourself ' . By this they held their communities in check against outgrowths of the individual will to dominate held especially among men.\n\nWell Chara, I am another yourself!

Shame on me, it is really interesting.\n\nYou are a true European, much more so than me, or all the people I know. For this: you are dealing with a quintessentially European problem, fratricidal war, and you are embarking on a path to an European solution, cooperation, understanding and defusing of statehood issues.\u00a0\n\nThe EU, of which now we are both citizens (congratulations, and welcome!) was born out the need to prevent the next war. The project was to accelerate economic integration so much that war would become impossible, unthinkable: you would be waging war on your suppliers, your customers, your children's educators, your colleagues. Any act of war would disrupt economically the aggressor as much as the victim. Let us never forget, when we see Single Market policies in action, that this is what we are talking about.\u00a0\n\nI am an European patriot. My country has been horribly ravaged by the last European war. It has been bombed and invaded. An entire branch of my own family has been exterminated by the Nazi SS \u00e9lite units, in retaliation for an attempt by anti-Nazi rebels tried to blow up a bridge\u00a0(they were among 23 civilians killed in one go because they happened to live closest to that bridge). Anything to stop that kind of stuff.\n\nAnd now, look. Germans are our brothers and sisters. The President of the European Parliament Martin Shultz, the son of a Wehrmacht soldier, visited the memorials of the worst Nazi excesses in Northern Italy (right in the region where I com from), and was welcome as a friend (these are his own words). And he is a friend.\u00a0\n\nSo, my heart is with you as you try to do your bit to reconcile Transnistria. It is a deeply European endeavor. To those that question your impartiality, you can answer that your dual citizenship makes you an EU citizen, and\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0makes you a partisan of economic and cultural cooperation as a safeguard against war.

Before heading home to Lima Zulu, I intend to go to the top of center point, a large tower with a panoramic view of London. I'd like to at least in terms of physical perspective emulate my experience of EdgeRyders in the city I currently reside. I'm not expecting clarity from this, I just don't think i'm quite ready to go home and continue with the work I left behind.\n\nI feel like for many of us this conference was fairly transformative, not in terms of altering intention or direction but the essential experience of meeting a group of 150+ individuals who came together with a shared understanding for geopolitics, complexity and the responsibility we each have in changing the course we're currently on. Coming at a time of increased global frustration and general paralysis, I think we all needed this.\n\nI experienced a colossal shift in my perception and relationship to the EdgeRyders project this weekend \u2013 prior to attending the conference I had felt limited by online communication, was perplexed by the network questions myself and Gaia were attempting to ask in our report and I couldn't quite locate the hook, the offer of EdgeRyders. I felt suspicious of it's relationship with an institution as large as the Council of Europe and was concerned with how my life experiences shared here would be used \u2013 I see now that the intentions are sincere. I can see that the conference was a representation of its internal limits, that the goal of <em>\u201chow Europe\u2019s young citizens could claim a stronger influence on our common future \u2013 and a larger share of the social responsibility that goes with it\u201d</em> laid out is one that can be taken up by working together. For this EdgeRyders has produced a unique burst of energy and the ideal network of individuals with which to approach the work ahead.\n\nPerhaps beyond this I can only identify small fragments of experience, things that instantly stuck out because they're reflective of emotions, solutions or pertinent aids to my current line of inquiry. It's my understanding from having run events with this level of intensity that it can take literally years to realise the full force and impact such a singular event of this nature can have.\u00a0\n\nI'll attempt to work to some kind of chronology in sharing my thoughts; during the first days of the conference I had a sense that I was witnessing the semi-naked levers of power in action. It surprised me the high degree of humility demonstrated by the policy makers that did attend. The frank honesty of Gilda Farrell in announcing the CoE was indeed a large slow moving bureaucratic machine, that it was something that needed to be addressed. It was clear that this was difficult territory for officials to participate in \u2013 confronted with a large group of young energetic, talented and highly networked individuals, gathered in a single place demanding answers; was obviously a new experience for everyone in the room.\n\nTheir very presence in this context seemed to cast them in the role of lightening rod for the rooms general contempt for those who currently hold power. Which struck me as problematic and indicative of the way much of us attempt to interact with power. The difficulty embodied in acting out the role of lightening rod can only have been reinforced by the twitter wall that hung totemically in the background of the conference, behind the heads of those speaking, a live testament to the real conversation taking place in the room and the multiple layers on which individuals were communicating - for the most part it seemed beyond comprehension.\n\nI became cognizant at this point that collectively, we in the room had already built; new ways of working, new spaces and new tools but it was the combination with this space that bought it into stark contrast with the goals expressed through the European project, which were historically exhaustive in ambition, regardless of recent struggles. Its vast scope and vision, for freedom of movement and peace in Europe set a tone and focus for the scale of the things we will need to consider building and maintaining going forward.\n\nThis point was further reinforced in the following days, during the \u201cCan the internet build big things?\u201d session and again during Vinay's Black Briefing session on Sunday with his articulation of an unstable \\#peacebubble in Europe.\n\nIt was also this session which hit me with a new fundamental consideration, in Vinay's statement \u201cif you do not understand international trade network theory, any attempt you make at radical political change will get screwed\u201d - primarily due to the current system which allows for the rerouting of resources, much like the passing of packets across the net. This is an epic stumbling block.\n\nOn the last day of the conference, early in the morning I bumped into Lucas, we walked together in the rain to \\#EdgeCamp, in that time he described the issues of \u201cDarks Mountains Pessimistic Little Brother\u201d session from the previous day. Individuals had taken issue with the seemingly sociopathic approach with which societal collapse had been discussed and the confusion summoned by the issues of ketchup and 'tourists as food' . He went on to explain he wanted to run a 'lateral thinking session for activists' that day, proceeded by a quick fire explanation of how lateral thinking can and should be used.\n\nIt struck me that this was a thinking process I have intuitively adopted, most likely through osmosis from those I grew up around but it wasn't until I had the process described to me in brain hacking terms that I could consciously reconcile this with my own mental process. This style of thinking has always been an uncomfortable sticking point for me, particularly in highly charged political discussion with peers. Moving forward this has given me an exceptionally useful framework with which to expand discussion, beyond reading all personal statements as components of a succinct ideological position but rather as a mode to advance past classic judgements which typically lead to stagnation in dialogue.\n\nThe thread that seemed to run concurrently throughout the conference for me was a question of narrative, in part due to on going conversations with those present but it was also articulated frequently by others I didn't know. We questioned whether we should seek to build a new grand narrative, what we would wish to articulate in telling new stories and how we could begin to execute on this in a way that's reflective of the highly distributed and decentralised way in which we now work together \u2013 again quite a task in itself.\n\nNadia remarked to me at some point during the 4 days that she felt she'd \u201cfound her tribe\u201d, I think that's a sentiment I share, never before have I felt such affinity with so many, compounded by a growing sense of possibility \u2013 I have no doubt that the collaborations that grow from \\#LOTE will shape the next decade of the work I do.\n\nThis seemed to be reflected in the way we actually worked together during and outside of sessions, at times this was entirely seamless - Ola later described this to me as perfect flow. After coming up with a plan for the Co-Monasteries over dinner, we went back to Nadia's to put together a document \u2013 our ability and the ease with which we set to work, found us finishing each others sentences within half an hour of working together. In reflexion the high degree of shared working practice with others for me was unique, I commonly work in this way on various projects but never before have these working methods gone so unspoken and resulted in such rapid results.\n\nIt seems we have all been cultivating similar practices in relative isolation.\n\nFor now this is the limit of my recollections, I'm back in London, in my bedroom, trying to restructure this post into something readable. I've spent the week catching up with friends, attending reading groups and trying to stay on top of neglected work. I've noticed in the short time I have been back that somethings changed in me and perhaps I can't fully locate it but the ideas and conversations I had during \\#LOTE have been flowing into everything around me.\u00a0\n\nI'd like to say thank you to everyone that was involved in organising, attending and making Edgeryders happen, you have achieved something phenomenal in bringing us together, in a way that cuts through a prevalent alienation, and you did this with sincerity and honest intentions. I have never witnessed such an act on this scale before.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-23 20:54:45", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 15:00:04.229368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1579, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3235, "user_id": 2199, "topic_id": 3202, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi from South Italy by ComprAssieme ( <a href=\"http://www.comprassieme.it\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.comprassieme.it</a> ).

This is how I perceive it as well.\n\nThe political class is endlessly sinking in bad behavior and cacophony without managing to hide his duplicity and incompetence. I sincerely believe that with this movement, some things have changed in the minds of many citizens --- in our collective consciousness --- This movement is still alive.\n\nI decode indignation as the expression of \"I\u2019ve had enough\" from many walks of life, regarding: 1) the steady deterioration of their economic situation; 2) and political leaders, unable to exercise control over the markets, especially financial markets.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes, an influential economist of the twentieth century, said about capitalism (in 1933): \"<em>Global capitalism and yet individualistic, is not a success. It is devoid of intelligence, beauty, justice, and virtue. In short, we dislike it and we begin to despise it. But when we wonder about what could replace it, we remain extremely perplexed</em>.\"\n\nThis declaration has transcended time without fading\u2026\n\nI have a certain malaise about the Occupy analysis we\u2019re seen lately. Some leave me skeptical. I am especially against the media mania which tends to formats everything, and a propensity to gaze on people and events with a marked <strong>superficiality</strong>.\n\nPersonally, I consider that the reasons to be an indignant are so numerous that one can hardly list them without fear of omitting some. Rage, anger, resentment, revolt are now present in most societies. They are mostly suppressed by fear, cynicism and individualism, but these are just waiting for the right moment to burst into the open.\n\nIn the upper echelons of power and wealth, business men and government officials adopted a low profile about this movement. It is so simple: let us have time pass and things fade away by themselves. They think that sooner or later, the movement will lose its momentum, it will be dismantled and it will show up in year-end balance sheets without adversely affecting the business.\n\nBut is it really, \"<em>business as usual</em>\"?\n\nLet us not lose sight of the reality of these young men and young women deprived of a future, in these nations stripped of an economy likely to offer no wages and dignity. Something important has taken shape in the minds of millions of individuals.

( including food production and machinery - see : http://opensourceecology.org ; and 18 000 pages on http://p2pfoundation.net + http://appropedia.org )\n\nA friend already bought a house in Leipzig, and can provide further details concerning costs. This house can also serve as an initial temporary base in Berlin.\n\nThe first step , with the Verein, is to buy one building. Once we set up the Verein - not for profit ( required to access a loan with Mieth\u00e4user Syndikat ), and buy the first 600 square meter building - in a livable condition ( we need at least 15 000 euros in cash, and can borrow 45 000 euros from Mithauser syndikat without / or very little / interest . A slightly more expensive building may reduce further the renovation requirements ) then we can also start inviting people to live there ( and or people can also set up their own Verein and buy their own flats for 1500 euros in cash )\n\nThe idea is to collaborate also with city related institutions, to redevelop certain neighborhoods, while creating economic activities ( in the form of cooperatives )\n\nIt may be possible to open up european wide partnerships under schemes mentioned in our last exchanges, such as\n[revesnetwork.eu](http://www.revesnetwork.eu/)\n[rights-poverty.eu](http://rights-poverty.eu/)\n\nThe first type of population I wish to attract are highly mobile, neo-nomads - who whish to create a base where they live part time. Very likely cosmopolitan neo nomads : artists of all kinds, programmers and various kinds of engineers and designers, natural building and permaculture activists, ... etc\n\nIt may be possible, if they are young people below 30 , and have a citizenship of one of the european countries eligible for a European Voluntary Service, to have volunteer living costs covered, with as aim, for example, to participate and learn from a local viable systems redevelopment scheme under peer production approaches.\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/youth/youth-in-action-programme/european-voluntary-service_en.htm\n\nIn my networks, we already have experience with such kind of \"neo nomad\" bases - see :\n\n[nomadbase.org](http://nomadbase.org/)\n\nWe can reproduce and customize such self organized hub in Leipzig, while also cconnecting it to other shared housing projects in Leipzig sharing similar interests and memes.\n\nI imagine each house to have its own internal governance - each house under a different not for profit ( or whatever non speculative ownership has been chosen by the people who bought the house )\n\nHopefully we can make sure people interested buy houses in the same neighborhood ( where more then half of the houses are vacant, with the possibility to connect the gardens )\n[/quote]", "created_at": "2012-07-11 16:27:46", "updated_at": "2019-11-25 10:38:34.029164", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 573, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19464, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1303, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Challenge?

I'm not exactly sure what Edgeryders is yet, but I can tell you what I'd like it to be: A social network of motivated and creative youths, getting together to co-create a better future. Step one would be a brainstorm of the biggest problems facing us in the future, and possible solutions to them. Step two: a clustering of these problems/solutions to create a top list, up for discussion through the social network. It would be awesome with a simple project management tool to get together in groups to start figuring out the problems, with the help of mentors. You could use the inside of the network like a CMS, with an outside view of these discussions in a beautiful/creative structure/layout. This solution requires an excellent web development team, not only technically but also ascetically. The next step would ideally be an in-person gathering of the top problem solvers to bring the solutions to fruition. The amount of attention Edgeryders gets depends on our ability to communicate its reason for being, and the problems that we are working to solve. I also want to once again underline that doing this in an ascetically pleasing manner will go a long way to grab the attention of the desired audience. I can't wait to start using it!</em> \u2013 <strong>Victor, Sweden</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-06 09:01:40", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 15:06:38.934504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 829, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32373, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 5078, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>Two more CSers agreed to host </b>\n\nOk so we got already 3 positive replies from CS community in Brussels.

I have communicated with our team here about the dragon dreaming exercise, and we were ready to move forward with it. Then the Transition Framing came into the discussion.\u00a0I would have been very keen in applying dragon dreaming, but I recall you saying we should not do it.\n\nWhat I think is more\u00a0useful now is to evaluate ALL workshops, not just on the basis of observations (because they are inevitably biased). As I suggested to @Nadia, I\u00a0believe the best way to do this is by\u00a0inviteing\u00a0the participants into the dialogue (they now have accounts on the blog). People know each other in Thessaloniki and there are possibilities\u00a0for these mutual contributions to evolve online and, later on, physically. Above all, our work here in Greece is not of the sort \"I come to deliver a workshop and then disappear\". We don't do that. What we do is to\u00a0evolve and empower these contacts, so when having to organise an(other) session, things look as easy as \"just booking a venue and a catering\". Which gives time to our (otherwise time-pressed) team to focus on other issues, eg. doing interviews.\n\nThis was the whole rationale of organising the workshop in Thessaloniki instead of Athens, because the city is smaller and the community is more interwoven. Sure thing, should we have done the workshop in Athens, we would have probably attracted a larger number of participants in the workshop. However, we would have missed the opportunity of organising a meet-up at the edge (cities other than Athens have less opportunities for such dialogues), with all the learning that comes from it.\n\nI am very keen in organising another workshop in Athens in December, and maybe there we can engage into different methodologies to build concrete synergies between projects. There are more communities in Athens with\u00a0access to funds, which delivered already some major projects,\u00a0so they have already more structure, and it will make more sense to have a prototyping session to investigate ways of scaling action.\n\nHowever, the brief I had at the beginning of the process is that we don't target communities of too much structure or connections with public authorities, etc. You understand these are the most \"idealogically charged\" projects that have very low trust for processes like \\#OPENandChange. Especially since they are connected with institutions like the McArthur Foundation, and even more where people start the workshop by saying \"we do this research for the European Commission\" four times, which as you saw, made a couple of people leave the venue before the discussion event started.\n\nSo, big lesson to be learned is the language and how messages are translated into local contexts, and how informed we are about these contexts\u00a0before we voice them.\n\nYou have also observed that although\u00a0the invitation was for 9am,\u00a0people turned up at 10am. One hour of valuable time wasted, that would have possibly\u00a0allowed to venture into more practical connections between projects.\u00a0Other people we interviewed during the week after the workshop, were mistaken that\u00a0the meeting was\u00a0at 9pm (evening)!\u00a0\u00a0But, this is life...\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-12 10:16:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.966368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 579, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18219], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31998, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 6096, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>It is necessary</b>\n\n@Rossana_Torri\n\nin my opinion it is necessary, at least to feel if partners' presentations go on seamlessly and within the determined time-frame.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-13 15:19:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.918218", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31917], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15780, "user_id": 2938, "topic_id": 4852, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\nThis sounds great, we will be getting an online version sorted pretty soon...\n\nWe'd love to link up with writers and journalists :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-19 18:43:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.635260", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3008, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 2975, "post_number": 1, "raw": "During the Spot the Future event in Tbilisi from the 24th till 26th, we of course need to eat in the evening. ideally we would love to cook food together, it strengthens collaboration and a community feeling.\u00a0\n\nWhat are we looking for?\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>group cooking</span></li>\n\n<li><span>social kitchens</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>\u200b</span><span>Let us know if you will take up this task to find something :)</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-13 13:06:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:16.466876", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 204, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25983, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2700, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Makes sense</b>\n\nMaybe we should also consider using only only one axis (east-west).\n\nI read somewhere that the gain of efficiency obtained using two axis is augmented by 5-10% respecting to a one axis system.\n\nUsing this site <a href=\"http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/apps4/pvest.php#\">http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/apps4/pvest.php#</a> it's even less.\n\nSo yes it would be really interesting to have a tool to calculate the efficiency respecting to the rotation (for both axis).\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-03 06:10:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.516461", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 96, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25971], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3339, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3306, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Introduction to talks and workshops proposed and selected by participants\n\nDate: 2014-10-23 12:20:00 - 2014-10-23 12:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2014-07-15 14:59:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.406922", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30398, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5957, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>One-on-one is useful</b>\n\nNone of the partner will want to listen to other partner's admin needs.

In Berlin, there is a group of young Philipino/Brasilian\u00a0artists called <a href=\"http://www.nowherekitchen.com/\">Nowhere Kitchen</a> who cook with surplus food. But there is so much more to it - they engage the people in chopping and preparing, but they take over the cooking process, so we do not end up with random, kind of awful food. Their recipes were stunning and combinations of tastes surprisingly delicious. The whole evening a guy was jamming to it some ambient/psychedelic stuff on guitar, and when the serving time came, they did a whole spiritual\u00a0performance before we started eating. I've been there, and some people from the street came around to join in. It was beautiful! And I think in such a delightful form eating leftovers can be dignified, and very political.
