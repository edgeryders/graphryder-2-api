Even from a purely technological perspective, it's not needed. What we'd need is data efficiency when we use the existing infrastructure. In the last 20 years, nobody cared about data efficiency in networks. It's always about more data throughput, without asking if the data we send still _means_ anything much? My guesstimate is that >95% of the data transferred does not mean anything. The exact same content and behavior could be transported with the remaining 5%. For example, we could remove all the bloated JavaScript of advertising trackers. Or (but that's a recent innovation) we could transition from JPG images to [BPG](https://bellard.org/bpg/) (astonishing side-by-side comparison [here](https://bellard.org/bpg/lena.html) and [here](http://xooyoozoo.github.io/yolo-octo-bugfixes/)) or to the (even better and completely free of patent nonsense) [AVIF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#AV1_Image_File_Format_(AVIF)).\n\nWhat 5G will enable is even more data bloat, and because bloated rather than size-optimized data is \"convenient\" on the developer side, that's what we'll get.", "created_at": "2019-06-04 12:44:52.088552", "updated_at": "2019-06-04 12:44:52.088552", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 235, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 144.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [54435], "is_reply_to": [54435], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2915, 4, 4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54543, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10059, "post_number": 10, "raw": "you guys should read this, very interesting breakdown of how Breitbart pushed the hillary email dicourse into focal point in run up to elections.

He has lately become intrigued by inequalities: what they are, how they are changing, what we can do about it. So, he started a group called the [Forum on inequalities and diversities](https://www.forumdisuguaglianzediversita.org/our-project/). The Forum recently released a report called 15 proposals for justice ([Italian only](https://www.forumdisuguaglianzediversita.org/proposte-per-la-giustizia-sociale/)), which is making waves. The report gives prominence to the consequences of technical innovation on inequalities and justice. \n\nSo, here is the idea. @nadia and I would like to organize a small meeting to look in more depth at the issue of how equality and justice are encoded in technological choices. Specifically, it would be interesting to look at the main technologies being developed in the NGI debate (blockchain folks, [decentralists](/t/10023), the fintech crowd etc.), and see how each impact on indicators of equality and justice. Putting in the same room technologists, economists and social scientists should allow for a more holistic perspective. For me, the interesting question is: **are some technologies more likely to lead to an outcome of increased justice than other technologies**? If there are, we might consider \n\nHopefully, we can provide some material to the people in charge of the next round of [NGI Open Calls](https://www.ngi.eu/opencalls/), and whoever is looking to fund new technologies that are human-centric, trust-enhancing and so on.\n\nWe are talking Brussels, October 2019.

I understand the EU missions in Chad and Mali as being stabilising, with a view to preventing deterioration in Libya and ensuing larger problems with refugee welfare in the Mediterranean. But Chad is a sovereign state - if it cannot be directly occupied (which I believe is completely out of the question) one has to accept that they exercise that sovereignty within some bounds. That probably means some autonomy in spending of monetary resources provided within the framework of this support.\n\nI'm going to go off on a tangent here, based on a conversation I had with someone last year:\n\nA potentially stabilising measure for the EU that could be of both external and internal use is the establishing of affiliate university faculties in African countries in the following way: universities which belong to a member state that has previously been a colonial power should not establish faculties in countries they have a previous historical relationship to. So for instance, a French university should not have a faculty building in Niger, and a UK university should not have a faculty building in Kenya.\n\nThis way one could potentially speed up education and knowledge transfer, but also help the EU deal with its current foreign policy coordination problems (which, among other things, are caused by different experiences of being a colonial power or not). If we're expecting further climate change in the EU, maybe a good first area to use as a test bed is agricultural technologies - African countries exist in a broader range of climate zones than the EU currently does, so mutual research in this area is beneficial not just for local residents but perhaps in future also for EU climate resilience. \n\nEstablishing real faculties is also a longer-term project than just dipping in and out with a fighter jet, and I imagine there're only limited way in which educational funds can be misappropriated.", "created_at": "2019-07-29 10:08:08.471489", "updated_at": "2019-07-29 10:08:08.471489", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 357, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [54689], "is_reply_to": [54689], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54591, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 10072, "post_number": 2, "raw": "How about something like this\n\n1.

Despite improved standards of living, poverty continues to be our reality - for youth and elderly, those living in cities and those on the countryside.\n\nThe economic and political reality of the generations before us has significantly changed and continues to change. \n\nWe feel anxious and unstable, resulting in a rise of alternative spiritual movements to help people cope.\n\nWe struggle with access to good, affordable care. We can&rsquo;t afford housing, and we can't afford to start a family.\n\nWe need to talk about it.\n\n**Wellbeing in Europe** is a community effort where people from different countries meet and share ways to being well in this day and age.\n\nWe need your help to set up a community event in November 2019 in the Czech Republic, which is part of a series of events happening at the same time in Poland, Serbia, Germany.\n\nYou'll organize, facilitate and attract participants from different socio-economic groups, educational levels, professions, ages to discuss matters important to their wellbeing and the state of their city, country, neighborhood, family.\n\nIn order to be successful, the event uses a methodology for online/ offline community building developed by Edgeryders: in short, connectors need to ensure that all the participants share stories on the project's community forum and interact with each other through the comments before and after the event. This creates an authentic and constructive debate to lead to a wide community research analysis, and will help us build a long standing network across different European countries.\n\n##  Your tasks will be:\n\nBEFORE THE EVENT:\n\n* Engage 50 people from different backgrounds in your village, town, city, country to join the community on http://edgeryders.eu, to share and post their stories on the community forum. The key topics for stories are: Healthcare and Social care services, Work and Prosperity, Spirituality and Morality.\n* Host a series of Virtual Cafes - online gatherings where people from other parts of your country and from other countries can meet and discuss together what they have learned from the stories that have been posted on the online community forum. The Cafes are announced on Facebook/ Edgeryders and other relevant channels, and the notes are posted to the forum.\n* Together with the people who you have brought into the online community and Virtual Cafes, produce the program for the local event.\n\nDURING THE EVENT\n\n* Ensure that the event is documented in writing and with video following the method and format you will learn by working with our international team.\n* Collect all the documentation material in one place and structure it well so that it is easy for those who could not come in person to participate in the discussion.\n\nAFTER THE EVENT:\n\n* Engage the participants to share their experiences of the event on the online platform\n* Write one article to summarise what happened, what was learned and your thoughts on the next steps, based on your experience.\n\n## How to apply\n\n1. Create an account on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/)\n2. Introduce yourself to the community by sharing a personal experience: [Add a New Topic here.](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/cz)\n3. Leave a comment to [3 community stories](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/) which are interesting and relevant to you.\n4. Register for our summer tour to meet the team and other community members and local partners: July 15th in Brno; July 17th in Prague /ADD FACEBOOK EVENT LINKS /\n\nWe will let you know about the results of your application by July 10th.\n\n## Estimated work time and remuneration\n\nThe contract is from July 2019 - January 2020, with 5000 EUR remuneration based on your deliverables. We estimate up to 3 days of work needed every week, depending on your own rhythm.   \n\n## Who are we?\n\nEdgeryders is a non-profit organisation living in symbiosis with an online community of thousands of activists, researchers, innovators, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. We believe that a smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other&rsquo;s work.\n\nWellbeing in Europe is part of a Horizon 2020 funded Research and Innovation Action under the official name POPREBEL. The project focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The research considers content collected through [http://edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/), subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.\n\nThe project is funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 822682 from 2019-2021. Other partners are University College London (UK), University Karlova, University Jagiellonski (Poland), University of Belgrade (Serbia).\n\n## How we will select connectors\n\nWe are looking for someone who speaks both Czech and basic English.\n\nWe will consider individuals who demonstrate an interest in Wellbeing in Europe; who are empathetic, curious and able to engage people from different walks of life in an authentic, constructive and respectful discussion about important topics.\n\nMost important, the connector is willing to collaborate with an international team and use online tools such as video chats for communication, engagement, documentation of work.\n\n## What happens if I am selected?\n\nYou will be working closely with the Edgeryders team to build the Wellbeing in Europe community conversation and the event series in your country.\n\nWhat happens if I am not selected?\n\nYou could get a 200 Eur reward for the story that you have contributed as part of the application process.

I am also queer and non-monogamous (polyamorous - since 5 years active and aware of it:)) - but exploring these things in my city and circles seemed so uncomfortable and difficult.

The MSCA project proposal does not need to be detailed in technical terms but some specification about the data collection and analysis would help. Do you think it feasible?\n[/quote]\n\nYes.\n\nThere are three possibilities. \n\nFirst: you generate your own data, getting the people that you are interested in to discuss on the Edgeryders platform. Advantages: GDPR/ethics compliant, in-platform ethnographic coding, support for SSNA via JSON APIs. In this case, you can learn about our approach to data (and copy whatever you want for your application in [this document](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencare-data-documentation/blob/master/Data%20management%20plan/Data_in_Opencare.pdf). Disadvantages: convening an online conversation is not easy, and you would have to do it yourself. We can set up a project space for you on the platform, and of course give you training and support, but you would be the only dedicated-and-paid person for the project.\n\nSecond. You find data that you can reuse, ideally in conversational form. In that case, the data will be what they will be. In order to code them, you need to either store them on the platform first, or code them with your own means. Advantages: no time spent in \"pushing\" an online conversation. Disadvantages: now you have to secure the whole chain of research activities (data protection compliance, research ethics compliance, import for compatibility with our software...). \n\nThird. You pivot your research into something that blends with existing ER research. For example, you could be looking at \"digital municipalism\" (Barcelona, Amsterdam etc. trying to step into the breach of technology regulation and infrastructure provision). This could become a branch of the #ioh study. In this case, you would be much more integrated with the company and its research team, and have access to its other activities, like communication and community management.", "created_at": "2019-06-08 14:17:42.724048", "updated_at": "2019-06-08 14:17:42.724048", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [54701], "is_reply_to": [54701], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55084, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10103, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Yeah @Jan the North Remembers \ud83d\ude01", "created_at": "2019-06-13 14:42:39.172045", "updated_at": "2019-06-13 14:42:39.172045", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55056], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54722, "user_id": 5173, "topic_id": 10105, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![meal%20together|666x500](upload://bVz6kNz9lCw0cewllGZavAsfa2W.jpeg) \n\nZdravo svima,\n\nJa sam Jelena, imam 28 godina i trenutno sam na master studijama u Londonu. Nakon \u0161to sam pro\u010ditala nekoliko tekstova ovde, pra\u0107eno nekim  refleksijama na moj \u017eivot u Velikoj Britaniji u odnosu na Srbiju, shvatila sam da je pitanje li\u010dnog identiteta vezano i za ono \u0161to bih nazvala nekim moralnim kodom, odnosno setom vrednosti kojim se vodim pri dono\u0161enju odluka na svakodnevnom nivou ali i u  klju\u010dnim stvarima u \u017eivotu.\nZa mene je moralni kod li\u010dni set vrednosti koji pre svega oblikuju najbli\u017ei ljudi u okru\u017eenju, porodica, prijatelji, kasnije u \u017eivotu posao, a tek onda neka \u0161ira zajednica, kao \u0161to je mo\u017eda nacija. Sve \u0161to do\u0111e posle tih prvih porodi\u010dnih inputa \u2013 kroz izlaganje razli\u010ditim prijateljima, obrazovanje, putovanja, to se posle samo nadogra\u0111uje. Za mene je dolazak na fakultet zna\u010dio iskorak iz jedne male i konzervativne sredine u kojoj je kod zajedni\u010dki, i  mogu\u0107nost da redefini\u0161em na\u010din na koji odlu\u010dujem \u0161ta je moj kod i kako se odnosim prema tu\u0111em moralnom kodu. Na fakultetu sam kroz razumevanje liberalizma do\u0161la do toga da je moralni kod moja individualna stvar, bez obzira  \u0161ta na nivou dru\u0161tva  biva manje ili vi\u0161e prihva\u0107eno. Na svom prvom poslu mi se potvrdila ta potreba da pratim individualno razumevanje mog koda, uslovno re\u010deno. Od svog poslodavca preuzela sam ono \u0161to mi je intuitivno odgovaralo i \u0161to sam smatrala vrednim nadogra\u0111ivanjem svog moralnog koda - odnositi se s dostojanstvom i po\u0161tovanjem prema svim ljudima bez obzira na to gde se oni nalaze u strukturi organizacije. Iako pona\u0161anje koje demonstrira poniznost ili oholost u odnosu na druge u zavisnosti od toga gde se oni nalaze u hijerarhiji definitivno nije deo zvani\u010dne nacionalne kulture,  toliko je zastupljeno da se gotovo o\u010dekuje od ljudi. \n\nU jednom  kontekstu konstantnih promena za mene je spiritualnost poku\u0161aj da ti, pored svega \u0161to ti se de\u0161ava na svakodnevnom nivou i svih tih promena kojima si izlo\u017een, sa\u010duva\u0161 te svoje core vrednosti, \u0161ta god da su one, i da se u svim tim situacijama i kontekstima koji su razli\u010diti vodi\u0161 tim istim vrednostima \u2013 tim svojim moralnim kodom i da te on u stvari usmerava kako da se pona\u0161a\u0161 u razli\u010ditim situacijama. Rekla bih da je **su\u0161tina spiritualnosti u dana\u0161nje vreme da promenjeni konteksti ne menjaju tvoj moralni kod.** \n\nMoje vi\u0111enje spiritualnosti nije mainstream u srpskom dru\u0161tvu. Pravoslavlje koje je dominantno u Srbiji nije uticalo na agnosticizam koji se kod mene kasnije razvio, jer je vera u mom najbli\u017eem okru\u017eenju smatrana li\u010dnim izborom, a ne op\u0161tim pravilom koje moramo da prihvatimo jer to radi ve\u0107ina. Ono \u0161to sam ja ustanovila, i zato i ka\u017eem da sam agnostik, jeste da ne\u0161to postoji, a mi to ne umemo da poimamo ili jednostavno ne moramo da defini\u0161emo. Ono \u0161to sam ja spoznala i \u0161to mislim da cenim kao vrhovnu vrednost u svom  kodu jeste prijateljstvo, pravi i su\u0161tinski odnosi sa drugim ljudima. \u010cist i iskren odnos koji traje iako \u017eivimo u eri gde se odnosi brzo grade, brzo raspadaju i \u010desto su jako povr\u0161ni. \n\n\nU tom kontekstu, kada razmi\u0161ljam o onome \u0161to se dominantno smatra po\u017eeljnim pona\u0161anjem ili prioritizacijom, verujem da se posve\u0107enost poslu i uspehu -  koje se \u010desto uzimaju kao  determinante po\u017eeljne dru\u0161tvene jedinke -   tako\u0111e nekako uguralo kao trend i deo novog moralnog koda. Nisam ni ja bila imuna na to \u2013 radila sam i po 16 sati, ali vi\u0161e zato \u0161to to volim nego radi konstantne optere\u0107enosti  uspehom. Me\u0111utim, i kad radi\u0161 ne\u0161to \u0161to te pokre\u0107e i \u0161to voli\u0161, burnout u nekom trenutku do\u0111e i natera te da preispita\u0161 kako da prona\u0111e\u0161 pravu meru\u2013 kako da svoj pomiri\u0161 sa  ostalim svojim vrednostima.  Jako je va\u017eno, ali i jako te\u0161ko prona\u0107i balans.\n\nIako \u017eivimo u jednom globalizovanom dru\u0161tvu, \u010desto poku\u0161avamo da narativno vratimo brojne teme u nacionalne okvire \u2013 za mene je to veliki izazov. Pri\u010dati o moralnom kodu u nacionalnim okvirima je jako te\u0161ko, naro\u010dito ako ne ose\u0107a\u0161 pripadnost tom dominantnom nacionalnom kodu.

But it's worth a try, you might get some people on board with interesting takes. \n\nNot sure how interested in civil activism are populist voters - but maybe the scene has changed over the years.

Maybe some specific focus also on the car industry and farming in connection with environmental issues and how there are different solutions proposed from different sites here?\n\n* far-right politics: Yes, AFD and Pegida are big topics. This is also connected to the topic of the big established parties losing trust and voters to both sides of the spectrum.\n\n* migration: Yes, however, the influx of people has slowed down which leads to the discussion going towards integration or how to live together increasingly, which leads for example to the topic of education which I will address later.\n\n* the rise of nationalism: I feel that this is not such a big topic in Germany even so far right politics are. It might be more relevant in Austria at the moment, but I might be wrong on that.\n\nAs raised by Inge and Nadia, they are mainly cut to address a part of the political spectrum to engage while the other part is presented as the problem. I personally agree with the notion that those right-wing political movements are a problem but depending on how diverse we want the discussions to be we have to also add other topics. \n*\n\nOne such topic for Germany that is always something people react across the political spectrum is:  \n### Big (global) cooperations and their influence on politics and everyday life\nGermany is very suspicious of companies such a Google and Facebook and for example, recently had quite some scandals with big automobile manufacturers.\n*\n\n\nAnother one: \n### The educational system and the differing chances due to different backgrounds\nPupils are still divided into 3 different school types at the age of 6, one leading theoretically to practical work after 9 years in total, one after 10 years to a career in craftsmanship or as a skilled worker, and the last one after 13 or 12 years to university. However, this system does not correlate well with modern work reality and has also been proofed to be very bad in terms of equality for students from different educational and economical family backgrounds. This effect of the background of the pupil connects also to migration and German as a second language and would be a viable topic to make posts on.\n\nIn terms of which platforms to use I am not sure.

Otherwise, it will become a bit of a messy and noisy place here as there would be small posts tagged with ad-hoc tags.

When it's all in a \"Web Content\" sub-category with a proper category description, that won't happen.\n\nIf you want to use tags and be sure they won't be re-organized or deleted in the future, I think there are two good options:\n\n* Use a `{projectname}-*` tag. This is a tag namespace specific to a project like POPREBEL and won't be touched by site admins. For details, see [our manual about tags](/t/-/6463#heading--4-2).\n\n* Introduce and use a new `webcontent-*` tag namespace, and document it in [our manual about tags](/t/-/6463#heading--4-2).\n\nBut in this case, instead of relying on tags I would propose you create one topic (referenced by ID in your software) with instructions in the first post and let people post their contribution as a reply in that topic. You can give them a formatting template like \"Start with a `## Heading`. Then one paragraph of text.\" Your software can then obtain the raw markup and render it as needed, using a URL with topic ID and post ID, like this:\n\n```\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/raw/10130/4\n```\n\nYou can of course use tags if you like.

Thank you for your vote in the discussion\n\nFirst and foremost, I must say that I am not an opponent of European integration as such. Likewise, I do not think our current government is against it. At the same time, however, I believe that the European Union in its present shape is an instrument of German economic and political domination. Much is said about European solidarity and that the smaller countries of Central and Eastern Europe should renounce some independence in its name. Meanwhile, a good example of how the countries of Western Europe treat European solidarity is the construction of the Nordstream II pipeline, which threatens the security of the Baltic States and Poland. Or the attitude of Frans Timmermans, vividly interested in the alleged threat of democracy in Poland, to the use of violence against protesters in France. A discussion about the rule of law in France? Of course not! It is France. We'd better talk about Hungary and Poland. Much to mention. Anyway, I think that the EU is in a serious crisis and needs remodeling. I am in favor of &quot;Europe of Homelands&quot;. About the contradictions of our and western interests: I believe that the basic contradiction is the attitude to Russia and the United States (Nordstream II, sanctions against Russia, involvement in Ukraine, American bases in Europe, the Chinese new silk route). In addition, I get the impression that for the West, our region is only a market and a reservoir of cheap labor - pseudo-colonial expansion space. This is in clear contradiction with the interests of post-communist countries to build an efficient and competitive economy. we should also mention the differences in worldviews. Shortening and simplifying: all leftist ideological initiatives will be treated with distrust in our region. Let me give an example: We **do not have** systemic experiences of oppression against homosexual people. Unlike many Western countries, where homosexual practices were penalized. That is why all initiatives of European institutions that support LGBT appear to us as silly  and unnecessary, even harmful.\n\nSo that would be enough :) it was interesting to speak in this place.

And of course you are right about some of the larger and better equipped countries being good at defending their interests within the bloc. But, as a native of a large but politically weak country (Italy), I find it would be perhaps more effective to insist that the power of states is _weakened_ within the EU, not strengthened. This way, Italians who are worried about something (say, Nordstream II or police violence against protesters) to make an alliance with like-minded, say, Poles or Hungarians. It would be \"one man, one vote\", with little room for states to block or veto ideas that have wide (but dispersed) support. \n\nYour idea of \"Europe of homelands\" was always present in recent European history (it was, for example, De Gaulle's battle cry), and I see it gaining traction. Maybe the reason why I am not fully convinced is that I do not trust my government very much. With some nice exceptions (the presidency of the Republic, the Bank of Italy, the Constitutional Court), Italian institutions have a dubious track record. EU institutions, for all their faults, seem to be more competent and less corrupt.

Mam drug\u0105 grup\u0119 inwalidzk\u0105 i w takim przypadku renta wynosi dziewi\u0119\u0107set z\u0142otych. To jest kwota poni\u017cej minimum socjalnego w Polsce.\nTak jak wspomina\u0142em wcze\u015bniej mog\u0119 p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 do pracy i \u201edorobi\u0107\u201d nawet drugie tyle. Jednak problem jest w tym, \u017ce oferowane prace s\u0105 najmniej atrakcyjne: dozorca, szatniarz, praca na zmywaku w restauracji. A ja sko\u0144czy\u0142em studia, pi\u0119\u0107 lat sumiennej pracy i pokonywania swoich s\u0142abo\u015bci. Setki przeczytanych ksi\u0105\u017cek, praca badawcza i mimo to jedyn\u0105 dost\u0119pn\u0105 ofert\u0105 pracy na dzie\u0144 dzisiejszy jest bycie szatniarzem.\n\nMy\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce to wynika z kilku czynnik\u00f3w: przede wszystkim z uprzedze\u0144 ale te\u017c sposobu w jaki traktuje si\u0119 osoby z problemami psychicznymi. Zanim poszed\u0142em na studia chodzi\u0142em do o\u015brodka dziennego. I tam ca\u0142y dzie\u0144 wype\u0142nia\u0142y nam nast\u0119puj\u0105ce czynno\u015bci: lepienie z gliny, de coupage, zaj\u0119cia plastyczne a dla ambitniejszych k\u00f3\u0142ko teatralne. Za namow\u0105 przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 postanowi\u0142em zrezygnowa\u0107 z tych zaj\u0119\u0107 i aplikowa\u0107 na studia. Jednak osoby, kt\u00f3re wci\u0105\u017c korzystaj\u0105 z takiej formy terapii nie zdobywaj\u0105 \u017cadnych praktycznych umiej\u0119tno\u015bci, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 przydatne w codziennym \u017cyciu. S\u0105 chowane pod kloszem i tam ju\u017c zostaj\u0105. Mi si\u0119 uda\u0142o, bo mam ogromne wsparcie w bliskich i rodzinie oraz naturaln\u0105 ciekawo\u015b\u0107 \u015bwiata i ch\u0119\u0107 do nauki. Mam poczucie, \u017ce wiele os\u00f3b, kt\u00f3re pozna\u0142em lecz\u0105c si\u0119 tak\u017ce ma du\u017cy potencja\u0142 jednak nie maj\u0105 jak go realizowa\u0107 poniewa\u017c nikt w nich nie wierzy i nie wspiera ich rozwoju intelektualnego.\n\nMoim zdaniem takie traktowanie sprawia, \u017ce osoby z chorobami psychicznymi jeszcze bardziej si\u0119 izoluj\u0105 od spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Widz\u0119 to po sobie. Jeszcze dziesi\u0119\u0107 lat temu cz\u0119sto chodzi\u0142em na wystawy, wernisa\u017ce, koncerty. Uczestniczy\u0142em w kulturze.

Edgeryders is an openended journey I have chosen to travel with people whom I love and respect for this very reason. \n\nIronically for someone whose work involves revolves around building relationships with new people, I find talking to strangers very difficult. It feels like there needs to be some kind of invitation to get started - sometimes the hosts introduce me to people but other than that I often end up in a corner somewhere until someone approaches me. Then there is the potential awkwardness if people think you are hitting on them :grimacing:. But mostly it's the psychological stress involved in putting yourself out there to be judged -even when you know you are extremely well prepared.\n\nThe  most difficult is purely social, when you just want to have an interesting conversation with new people. But the same goes with work related events - because of the travelling and preparation involved, especially if you are there to achieve something specific. I used to do a lot of public speaking for Edgeryders but have stopped because the return on effort is so low. \n\nYesterday @noemi @alberto and I got into this topic again. The topic started with our lamenting _flygskam_ Swedish for \"shame of flying (on airplanes). Conferences etc - what these physical events optimise for - knowledge sharing? you could easy do this via e.g webinars. Is it getting access to important information? In certain contexts that is the case, but I would say doing as we do via online conversations is much more efficient. So that leaves the social bit, which is the one thing event organisers rarely pay attention to: helping participants find and connect with the \"right\" people for them. Especially the introverts.\n\nOver the years we have built a unique Edgeryders format for events that are optimised for building deep relationships and collaborations, and great content designed by and for the community. \nSo far we have been doing this via our annual community gatherings which bring together members from all over the planet. What if we could somehow build on these lessons in making it easier to build many more meaningful and generative relationships in our local environments?\n\nThis is what we have come through conversations with @bob @marina Letizia Gambini and many more people in the edgeryders fam....\n\nWe want to do thee different kinds of events, you can think of them as a funnel with the top layer being very \"light\" on costs and coordination and \"distributed\", the middle involving some coordination but not much,  and the bottom being highly curated events with community members, partners etc.\n<hr>\n\n## Open Distributed discovery: Ephemeral communities \n<hr>\n<br>\n\n**PopUp Meetups at events organised by others.** These are pop-up encounters at interesting events spanning art, science, design, history, philosophy, technology, politics, sports, professional/project related stuff etc. \n\n**Concept is simple:** you pick an event you were interested in going to anyway, wear some kind of branded badge or bag or hoodie or sticker, and have the Edgeryders social media crew spread the word that people can come talk to you about something (your choice of topic) while there. \n\n**Ideally the topic should be matched to the event.** I.e only pick something that you are interested in and that you would like to chat with others about. With me it's easy, dance, performance art, wierd workshops about the latest wellness/fitness fad - anything about the body and I'm in (there's a reason I started a pilates studio). No preassure to write any posts or anything, Edgeryders just offers nice \"free\" support to meet new people around shared interests. \n\n**They fall into three categories:** Social,  Personal Development, Professional. \n\n**How do people join/participate:**\n* Buy the kit of well designed physical \"connect\" artefacts - covers cost of design, production and delivery of the kit.\n* Pick an existing event or tell us about a new one you want to connect at via a hashtag\nThe outreach team promotes the meetup at that event.\n* No forms to fill in, no names or emails in a database, nothing to prove or sell.\n* Maybe we can make it so that people can pay via crypto currencies or cash on location too.\n\n**What we need to realise this:** \n* A core group of nice people who want to help seed it (we need nice photos and bios for the \"who's behind this)\n* Great branding and a comms plan to promote the concept\n* Product design of the kit - ideally low impact, recycled materials - something you can add onto stuff you already have\n* A good local producer of the kit artefacts  \n* A Calendar of event descriptions that come in from different sources: hashtag on twitter/FB/instagram, and later...updates on websites, mailing lists, facebook pages). If they are aggregated in one place on edgeryders it makes them alot easier for us to sustain\n* Social media updates and partnerships with \n\n<hr>\n\n\n## Introductions & Connections\n<hr>\nEvents in conversational format held connecting the edges and the centre around a topic of current relevance to our strategic objectives and current priorities.\n<br>\n\n**1. Evening seminar and discussion:**\nThese are small, intimate events that bring together an insitutional insider with an edgeryder to introduce and discuss a topic/ question ntroduced/framed by Edgeryders. They convene people who have relevant experitise with divergent thinking and perspectives presented by practitioners with first hand experience of the topic. The discussions are aimed at sensemaking through deep discussion informed by data and first hand experiences of practitioners.\n\n<br>\n\n**2. OpenTable - TableOuverte - OpenTafel**\n\n_See what&rsquo;s on the menu. Call and reserve your place at the table. Have great food in great company._\n\nOpen Table is a secret supper club. A group of people who do not know one another meet over dinner having inspired conversation over delicious food in great company.\n\n* The hosts welcome the participants and presents a topic of cross-disciplinary interestingness spanning art, science, design, history, philosophy and more. \n* Everyone introduces themselves briefly and shares some reflections on the topic...before you know it the conversation is up and away. We have a lovely time together.\n* Each person covers the cost of their meal.\n* We all leave having had meaningful and inspiring conversations.\n\n**What we need to realise it:**\n\n* A core group of nice people who want to help seed it (we need nice photos and bios for the \"who's behind this)\n* Great branding and PR \n* Agreement with a couple of restaurants that they take opentable reservations once a month and cover the cost of the meal for the \"host and secret guest\"\n* Agreement with some friends and partners to promote them on their websites\n* Organise a couple of them ourselves inviting \"special guests\" from our network who will be in town\n \n`<br>\n<hr>\n\n## Deep Dives\n<hr>\n\n**1. retreats** _very generative relationshipwise but costly to organise_\n**2. workshops** _expensive to organise and we have had limited success in promoting these so far..._\n**3.

[I wrote up my experiences here about the first event ][oiot1], and [the follow up event here in 2017][oiot2].\n\n[amee1]: https://www.amee.com/\n[oiot1]: https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/2018/03/13/writing-up-iotmark-1-of-2/\n[oiot2]: https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/2018/03/13/writing-up-the-iotmark-part-2-of-2/\n\nIf you're short on time though, the TLDR version is that we had a _really_ hard time seeing how building IoT products in a environmentally responsible way, could be commercially viable in the current context because we are so used to shifting many of the costs of related to a service/product outside an organisation, \n\nI mean - we didn't even have a good way to capture all the bad in a single diagram or artefact, to really help us talk about which harms we wanted to mitigate first, let alone agree a some methods that smaller companies might be able to adopt, and survive. We figured it needed to be something accessible to them to be able for us to realistically propose it in the trust mark then. \n\n#### Finding some stuff via Isabel's work - MET Matrixes,and EcoCosts\n\nBack then, I wasn't really aware of any accessible framework to talk about the different kinds of costs incurred on humans or the environment, but through reading some of Isabel Ordonez's work, I've since came across some tools like [MET (material, energy toxicity) Matrixes - see the grid in that deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zZ_7KTfJM_6gKzI638yeyQY3k1PzHc2o7vQUkX1ij24/edit#slide=id.g57245d9f11_0_5), that at least let you start enumerating some of these costs for industrially designed products, and give some data to inform tradeoffs you might make, and [EcoCost][ecocost1], with some nice apps and openly licenced data you can work with.\n\n[ecocost1]: http://ecocostsvalue.com/\n\nThat said, these frameworks tend to be aimed at mass producted tools or services - where you typically couldn't change much about how you deliver a service to people after you've decided to ship something.

In general, though, there is a dominant one at any given time. Right now, though, we have a new situation: *two* large scale conversations are ongoing at the same time, the ones in #ioh (associated to the NGI Forward project) and #wellbeing (associated to the POPREBEL project). \n\nI have a hunch there is something to be learned by looking closely at what patterns form as we go. I do not have hypotheses to test (yet?), but I like to look closely at raw data. Today I made a plot of the number of posts per week of the two projects. The non-public workspace discussions are not included.  It looks like this:  \n\n![image|490x318](upload://3K0YEdC1MnTikJ00Xdzg5koGwD0.png) \n\nSome interesting POPREBEL conversations had already started in 2018 \u2013 I assigned those to week 1. So POPREBEL had a head start. An official POPREBEL platform space was rolled out in March, when NGI was still dormant; at the beginning of April NGI also kicked in, and grew a bit faster than POPREBEL until the past few weeks. At the time of writing, we have:\n\n|              | NGI FORWARD | POPREBEL |\n|--------------|-------------|----------|\n| **Participants** |          85 |       50 |\n| **Topics**       |          81 |       93 |\n| **Posts**        |         797 |      468 |\n| **Words**        |        111K |      87K |\n| **Pairwise interactions**        |        251 |      151 |\n\nNotice how the number of posts per topic is lower in POPREBEL (5.0) than in NGI Forward (9.8). POPREBEL also has many more topics with only one post, and no replies \u2013 maybe something for @noemi and @natalia_skoczylas to look into?  \n\nThe pairwise interactions row refers to the number edges in the respective social networks. Both graphs are similarly dense, with average degree =  ~3.\n\nThe new version of the networks looks like this:\n\n![image|690x427](upload://7ewp3qt8P9MjUSseuTTi4qejin6.png) \n\nRed edges represent POPREBEL-related interactions; green edges NGI FORWARD-related ones. Gray nodes represent people who are involved in both discussions. They are 16 in all. The graphs show me two things:\n\n* No singletons: everyone that has engaged has interacted with at least one other person.\n* A denser central group of nodes, where people are discussing with each other. \n\nA lot of the network is still kept together by community managers and engagement folks. Here is what happens if I drop just 8 users, that is `('nadia', 'noemi', 'alberto', 'hugi', 'johncoate', 'natalia_skoczylas', 'MariaEuler', 'mattiasx')`:\n\n![image|690x427](upload://bUtuAUaRuXqX5mb0t1zP92S7baL.png) \n\nOnly 109 out of the original 402 edges remain. Still, what remains is still a small world network, made up of about 65 users that are either free-floating or part of small components with only two nodes; and of 46 users that are connected in a giant component.

The session was hosted by the [Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN)](https://www.ctc-n.org/) to discuss key aspects of eco-village design from environmental and social considerations to the use of supportive technologies, with examples from Asia, Africa and Europe. A part of the presentations by the [UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int/) and the [INFORSE Network](http://www.inforse.org/), it was interesting to see the examples of grassroots projects led by the communities consciously working to preserve its traditions and natural resources: \n- Ousmane Aly Pame is the founder and president of a community-service organization [REDES](http://www.redes-ecovillages.org) in the Sahel region which saw a collapse of ecosystems and traditional lifestyles \u2013 _the elders have witnessed their paradise transforming in a lunar landscape in only two generations_. Eco-villages are considered to be the response to multiple ecological challenges. The eco-village hubs are inspiring other surrounding villages and raising awareness through educational and cultural activities such as theater and festivals.

But, farming have to compete for land and wateraccess with other activities. Where to find hectares of farmland near the cities and millions of cubic meters of fresh water to irrigate crops? And, how to fully exploit Urban Agriculture potentiality to produce positive social and economic impact on urban communities?\n\nJellyfish Barge produces crops grown in high ef cient hydroponics.

But I agree with @hugi that UI/UX development that's up to the standards of UX in one of our H2020 minisites would need additional money.\n\nSo it's the typical \"requirements changed while IT project underway\" story, and I did not see that coming :expressionless:", "created_at": "2019-09-02 16:30:59.766740", "updated_at": "2019-09-02 16:30:59.766740", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 204, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 77.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58431], "is_liked_by": [4022, 8, 1856, 3622], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59518, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 121, "raw": "Please forget about the voice based options within the limit of the current budget ;-)", "created_at": "2019-09-17 17:56:03.314758", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 17:56:03.314758", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59511], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59726, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 130, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:129, topic:10217\"]As I understand it, the API will be done soon.[/quote]\n\nThe API is ready now.

The difficulties start with the fact that there is no proper way to store such data in Discourse at the moment: you probably don't want to publish them together with the post that goes to the platform, but somehow \"hidden\". For that, we could create custom Discourse fields in user records and store the data there, but that's ugly as you'd need quite some fields and they clobber our nice an clean userdata records with all that structure that will be empty for most users. Putting all that data together into one user record field is less ugly in one way and more ugly in another. And then it's about how to keep this data safe \u2013 that's kind of acceptable if we hand that personal data to Natalia's research team and delete it from our database, though. It's additional admin work on our side, of course.\n\nBut there's a nice hack that @natalia_skoczylas could use to work around the issues from above. As far as I understand you use one fixed survey computer for this exercise at Biennale. In that case, just collect the data only locally on that computer, and only send the text content to Discourse. That's not much additional effort: the web developer would create records in the browser's local storage for the data that is not to be sent, together with the user ID of the corresponding Discourse user so that you can associate this data with Discourse topics during your research.\n\nWith that kind of solution, the potentially more sensitive data does not leave the survey computer and we (Edgeryders company) don't have to take responsibility for it. Works for me. (If you choose this way, be sure to take backups of the data from the survey computer once or twice a day, to prepare for the case when a user will accidentally wipe browser storage or similar \u2026 this type of storage is slightly \"fragile\".)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd once again about the audio components:\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:123, topic:10217\"]5k maybe for a good pipeline to just upload voice and post it[/quote]\n\nA good guess if we'd have to build that pipeline ourselves.\n\nMaybe, _maybe_, there is an implementation of what we'd need out there already, though. In my mind, the ideal case would be posting MP3 files to Discourse because: they are small and can be uploaded as normal post attachments files to Discourse. Then, we'd embed a player inside the Discourse post to play them (maybe that already happens, as for uploaded `.mp4` videos it does). That way, no backend work at all would be needed.\n\nBut we need the browser to create and upload MP3 files. Turns out, at least one part of that exists: there are at least two [libraries for in-browser MP3 encoding](https://blog.addpipe.com/recording-mp3-audio-in-html5-using-vmsg-a-webassembly-library-based-on-lame/). Warning: this is crazy and cutting edge technology. Browsers were not meant to do this, so expect it to not work everywhere. It could be made to work on a single survey computer though.\n\nEven if we're lucky and find good components, I don't think the price tag would go below 3,000 EUR for a reasonably reliable implementation.\n\nAnother find: there are [commercial products](https://addpipe.com/product) for this use case. Not cheap though. I don't think it would change the above price tag as the challenge now becomes to integrate their product. But at least, success is almost guaranteed with this. The downside is of course that we'd not get an open source end product: spending so much to integrate somebody's commercial product is a waste in my view.", "created_at": "2019-09-17 21:25:16.253728", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 21:47:19.583537", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 659, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 42.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [59530, 59523], "is_reply_to": [59530, 59523], "is_liked_by": [4022, 137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60386, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 146, "raw": "It looks very nice @natalia_skoczylas. \n\nFor what it's worth - some of this work has already been done for the festival site.

I made some minor editing to fit this forum better. \n\nSorry for a long rambling text but I'm thinking a lot of these kinds of problems due to my internal conflict between my ADD (human limitation, which includes problems with processing info) and my intense curiousity (filling my brain with too much info). \n...\nI thought a lot about innovation rate when I wrote this comment a earlier today: [https://www.facebook.com/mrhama/posts/10156538052578951...](https://www.facebook.com/mrhama/posts/10156538052578951?comment_id=10156538092398951&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&amp;hc_location=ufi)\n...\nThe OP is really good as it explains why the economic ecosystem fails to select for growth in utility because of various impeding factors. \n\nI thought a bit about questions similar to Cause 1 and 2 last week and spoke about them with some friends. I think Cause 2 is a really hard nut to crack as it's impossible to have open APIs for personal data (as we learnt from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, mentioned by OP). To spur innovation and bust the tech oligopoly we'll need open standards, protocols, interoperability etc. The big problem here is that the oligopoly as well as their customers (advertisers) oppose such changes as that would undermine their profitable positions. \n\nI wonder how and if grassroot innovations alone can break the staleness of the oligopoly. It might take a bit of trust busting from USA and EU to really shake things up through political means. \n\nRight now there are a bunch of competitors to the oligopoly but they are irrelevant since most of them don't seem to realise the importance of working with the whole stack. Each of them have simply too little brainpower (since most good developers are already employed by the oligopoly) to be anywhere close to develop as good services as the oligopoly does which makes the strategy of competing with a better service a fool's errand. Bitchute will never be able to outcompete Youtube with a bit freer speech as their USP.\n\nMy idea last week was to develop some kind of virtual business card as a hub for metadata about a person or a company you want to follow and then build a platform to navigate these information streams. Different communications platforms can be connected to that hub. My idea at that point didn't even attempt to solve the problem of the storage of the databases. I doubt we can solve that issue for the forseeable future since only the major clouds have the scale to store the data cheap enough. Storing data locally is incompatible with the nature of social media since the communication is asynchronous. So far blockchains have been unimpressive in their ability of integrating social media or other services into the protocol itself to make data storage disembodied from a singular entity like a corporation. So far the only use case for blockchains is to tranfer money since then there's an acceptance for the high costs of transferring small amounts of data. \n\nI'm very happy to read that many of my ideas about some kind metadata manager had already been thought of and implemented by Worldbrain. I'm also a bit skeptic: Does Worldbrain want to compete in an existing market dynamic or do they want to disrupt the dynamics. It might be hard to achieve both goals of making things interoperable as well as spending time to develop a good UX. Wikipedia/Wikimedia have managed this but for such a shifting service such as managing information overload in an environment where the flows of information are locked into personalised propertiary algorithms on different platforms it might be a much harder task how to make the webs manageable. \n\nI'm currently opting out from a lot of different data managers and unfollowing topics on social media (like Pocket) and just shove the data into Excel instead where there's a simple 2D-layout that suits me better. This process of decluttering gives me a lot of inspiration. There are many things I learn about myself and of the internet through this process. Maybe we can remodel the stack, loosen the grip of the oligopoly and spur more innovation. What I desire is the somwhat oxymoronic desire of having many different information flows manageable through a small set of apps/sites/services. Facebook and RSS have failed me.

Who can hire a collaborator, and when?</h2>\n\nProject leaders or team make most hiring decisions. Compensation comes from project budgets. In large projects, project leaders might decide to break the project down and assign different parts of it to different teams. When that is the case, projects leader directly hire team leaders, endow them with a hiring budget and let them make the hiring decisions about their own teams. \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Formalities and starter kit</h2>\n\nOnce the new collaborator has accepted to join Edgeryders, (s)he is provided with a basic toolkit. All collaborators have it. Depending on their role, some collaborators might need extra tools.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Write a contract</h3>\n\nNeedless to say, everyone in Edgeryders works according to a written contract. No exceptions. \n\nContracts purchase independent labor. We do not, as a rule, withhold money to pay taxes on behalf of collaborators. Rather, we pay them the gross amount, and let them sort out their own taxes and social security contributions. Edgeryders' [employment policy](/t/12262) contains details on the legal relationships between the company and its collaborators, and their rationale. There is an exception: collaborators who are residents of Estonia. If you are hiring an Estonian resident, please get in touch with a member of the board. \n\nContracts are made of two part:\n\n* [A boilerplate](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dXy9hfsqgpQTeXgclqW62aR6BTePWKTzJ7_d9Rjvu0Q). As of 2020 there are two, both agreed with an Estonian lawyer to make them tightly compliant with Estonian law. One is a generic contract; the other one is specific to EU-funded projects, such as many ran by the #research-network or #earthos. Pick the one appropriate to the case at hand.\n\n* A terms of reference annex. The project or team leader needs to write this. Please be specific, succinct and clear. We have a tradition of referring explicitly to the project the person is being hired for; most TORs start with a \"Background\" section, that name and describe, in one sentence, the project and Edgeryders' role in it. The second section is normally called \"Duties of the collaborator\", and spells out the duties of the collaborator. Many contracts have a third section, \"General responsibilities of the collaborator\". This can be the same in most contracts:\n\n    > * Be familiar with, and loyal to, the company&rsquo;s values, ethical stance and work culture,\n    > * Use responsibly, securely and dutifully the company&rsquo;s designated physical and online workspaces. Use the allocated edgeryders.eu email address when communicating with third parties, cc-ing a company director as appropriate.\n    > * Commit to personal service, and refrain from subcontracting the work described in this contract to others.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Sign the contract</h3>\n\nWe generally sign contracts electronically. Use the process via SignRequest (see the [Company Manual](/t/-/6168#heading--4-1)). \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Platform account</h3>\n\nThe Edgeryders platform is where most work gets done. Ask the new person to sign up at https://communities.edgeryders.eu. Mind the naming convention. Project leader: if the new hire works on  projects that have restricted workspaces, make sure you give her access to them. Generally, we add her account to a group of special users, such as `Collaborators` or `Company`. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Get a `name@edgeryders.eu` email address</h3>\n\nSee [here](//t/3365). In Edgeryders, we use email only to communicate with people outside of the company and the community. The platform and the Matrix chat are the preferred channels for in-company and in-community interactions.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. Matrix account</h3>\n\nSee [here](/t/6430). The Matrix chat is our rapid exchanges channel. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-6\">2.6. Dynalist</h3>\n\nSee [here](/t/7618). Dynalist is our minimal project management tool. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-7\">2.7. Google Drive Enterprise</h3>\n\nWe use Google Drive Enterprise as a file repository and collaborative document editing facility. We are looking for a suitable non-proprietary alternative, but in the mean time here we are. \n\n* If the new collaborator has a Google account, the project leader adds her to the relevant Team Drive(s) (cheaper solution \u2013 preferred).\n* If not, ask @matthias to create one for her. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-8\">2.8. FreeAgent account</h3>\n\nThe project leader creates a FreeAgent user for the new collaborator. If she does not have the necessary permission in FreeAgent, she can ask any of the Edgeryders directors. A collaborator with no special roles needs a level 2 FreeAgent account to  submit claims for travel expenses refunds. A unit coordinator needs a level 5 account to be able to submit bills and emit invoices. See [here](/t/-/6168#heading--3).\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-9\">2.9. Zoom</h3>\n\nWe use Zoom a lot for online meetings and conference calls. There is no need for individual Zoom accounts, though some people do have them. If the new collaborator is meant to *organize* online meetings on a regular meetings, she will need access to the corporate account.  See [here](/t/8872).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-10\">2.10. Google Calendar</h3>\n\nWe do not yet have a structured process around a shared calendar, and we would like to get out of Google anyway. But most people use a shared Google Calendar called \"Edgeryders events\". All new colleagues should have access to it, until we find something better.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-11\">2.10. Business cards</h3>\n\nIf the new hire has a public-facing role, she or he will need business cards: I know, they are quaint, but we are already weird, so I think Edgeryders business cards might be reassuring and familiar. Files for business cards are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1KiEEPZUjlsy3xqWwkokS5hmSytKUESxh).\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Culture and processes</h2>\n\nEdgeryders has its own culture, quite different from that of most companies. We appreciate it can be disorienting at times. This section contains tips and references to help new collaborators make sense of norms and culture, that are often taken for granted by veterans.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Orientation and mentorship</h3>\n\nAs a newcomer to Edgeryders, we encourage you to ask more experienced colleagues to take some time for answering your questions and pointing you in the right direction. It could be a good idea for you to ask one of the veterans to be your mentor, a default go-to person that takes some care for the former's integration process. Veterans are encouraged to be generous with their time; mentorship can be very rewarding. \n\nIf you have a problem working together with one or more of your colleagues, we encourage you to talk to @johncoate. John has agreed to act as Edgeryders's \"HR ombudsman\". He will listen attentively to what you, and then help you look for a solution. When you speak to John in his ombudsman capacity, he treats what you say as confidential, unless you agree otherwise.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Principles for collaboration and operations</h3>\n\nPlease read [this short description of the principles underpinning our working together](/t/8729).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Company manual</h3>\n\nThe carefully maintained [company manual](/t/6168) contains descriptions of all main processes in Edgeryders. It is not necessary to read it through, just refer to it when you are in doubt. Please consider contributing to it, for example extending it to cover new or badly documented processes.

I attended the last weekend of the Biennale of Warsaw - I was sent there to visit Transunions, a very interesting conference designed by the Biennale Team and Jonas Staal, which had an unexpected outcome - I will write a longer post about it soon. I learned a lot about establishing spaces that are inclusive and transformative. \n\nBut a bonus came from my visits to other side events, especially to a small exhibition organized in a school for children with intellectual disabilities (differently capable? What's the right word to use here?) and a tour that one of the initiators of this exhibition gave us. I have learned a lot about the way this part of the school system operates in Poland, and about setting up inclusive art projects. It was wonderful, and it deserves another small post. \n\n2. I hired two local connectors, who will start working with me on the project this July. I'm very excited about it! I am now working on their contracts and will have a call this week about our workflow and strategies. \n\n3. I am preparing a small [presentation/workshop](https://www.facebook.com/events/548985718968997/) about the stories from the edge for the Culture Backstage event in Brussels, which will happen this Friday. I am completely booked out! I will talk about my beginnings, Nepal, OpenCare and other things we're doing, and about the art of collecting stories. \n\n4. We went public with the call for connectors in Czech and the events in July, and we're now hoping to get the right person to work with us by the end of the month.

In addition to young people with ideas, there are others who have a variety of skills. Plenty of these young people are looking for ways to use their skills for the social good, and why not to make a living out of it, when an appropriate and a sustainable mechanism, that could be a social enterprise, is put in place. \n\nTo make this even more interesting for all the current and the potential and future stakeholders, we will be encouraging and pushing for ideas that promote the use of new technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and blockchain, to accelerate social innovation in the region and scale it up later on, and also look for young people who might have some of this set of skills. \n\nNow, our work will be building connections between these two groups, by fostering conversations and P2P mentoring through the community calls or on the platform, so they can come together to innovative, efficient and scalable solutions for the challenges in their community.  \n\nTo achieve these goals, Sohayeb and I have codesigned the following process in order to attract young people to the calls in first place, and to stimulate collective intelligence by encouraging conversations through the MENA YP.  \n\n##  Process\n\nThe target beneficiaries are mainly young people aged between 18 and  35 years old from Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.\n\n**We have two targets :**\n\n**a. _Aspiring young social entrepreneurs_**  \n* They already have an idea of a social enterprise/venture\n* They are in the process of validating their ideas \n* They  are looking for mentors, partners or any kind of support\n* They  are willing to have shareholders, and commit to start social entreprises  \n* They are aware of their communities\u2019 problems, and thriving to solve them through entrepreneurship\n\n**b. Skilled young people**\n\n* Who do not have a project idea, but they aspire to be part of a social and innovative venture. \n<br>\n\n**The process will be as following:**\n\n1. Call for applications with all the necessary communication campaigns \n2. Applications on the platform, where all applicant must briefly introduce themselves and describe their project idea or their areas of skills.  \n3. Preselection and matching \n4. CI calls \n5. Follow up conversations on the platform \n6. Final Selection \n7. Festival & Pitching \n\n\n**To sum up:**\n\nWe strongly believe that there is a huge opportunity out there for all parties, whether the young professionals and entrepreneurs from the MENA region, their peers in Africa and in Europe, and finally for donors who might be interested eventually in building the bridges between them in the future, for collaboration and for knowledge sharing.  \n\n## 2. Project Time line ( Draft)\n![Diapositive1|690x388](upload://rW7VgyF4gLkWx5REV9bWCOpwoTE.png) \n\nSo **one of the key steps to make this work, and I am really counting on you in this matter, is mobilizing mentors to provide high-quality community calls.**\n\nNot only so we can attract more innovators from the MENA region but also to build the trust in this program and in the power of collective intelligence to achieve progress. We need you in two ways: \n\n- First to **share with us the best practices for mobilizing and managing mentors**, and if there were any successful prior experience within Edgeryders community.\n\n- Second, we want to start build our mentors\u2019 network right here, so if you are willing to **dedicate few hours per a month to support aspiring young entrepreneurs from the MENA region**, please let us know and tell us about your areas of expertise. \n\nRemember, it is only FEW HOURS per month, and you might be eventually happily surprised by the outcomes of these few hours :)  \n\nWaiting for your comments and feedback!", "created_at": "2019-06-27 19:44:14.787952", "updated_at": "2020-09-21 15:55:12.877079", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 735, "wiki": false, "reads": 38, "score": 699.6, "like_count": 11, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022, 5, 4265, 3706, 5400, 5860, 6114, 6132, 428, 6916], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55824, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10247, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Oliver are you ok with us editing it a bit e.g headline?", "created_at": "2019-06-28 08:01:03.590021", "updated_at": "2019-06-28 08:01:03.590021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 28.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55796], "is_liked_by": [5191], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58426, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10369, "post_number": 12, "raw": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pserEjyo9DA\n\ntext: https://edgeryders.eu/t/crazy-coffee-hacks-how-to-remove-coffee-parchment-shells-etc/6421", "created_at": "2019-08-27 06:14:46.299275", "updated_at": "2019-08-27 06:14:46.299275", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 41.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58425], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55862, "user_id": 5191, "topic_id": 10247, "post_number": 6, "raw": "of course!

My name is Wael from Jenin, occupied **Palestine**. I am overwhelmed happy to find this topic from people from our suffering but rich of change-capacities region. I lived in **Germany** 17 years for study and work, and came back 10 years ago to my hometown as a reflection of feeling responsible for cocreatinge change in how we art up life. After my return I've landed in our family business and thought good ideas like OpenSource-EcoVillage will resonate with existing organizations and people but it wasn't the case. \nNow, after almost two decades of being an open visionary geek connecting the dots and thinking about how to construct a new **collective decentralized self-organizing gateway** to life so that we can encounter a system in crises can't heal it self, Ive asked my self, how to **downscale** all my concepts, ideas and passion regarding Ecovillages, Global-Palestine beyond boarders and Global Brain Application (you can refer to my [Human Lab site](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgBQX42jIOFkfnbHf1swP3GwDd0O-jzpjYYv63OjDRg/edit#heading=h.ofqm4bivlrj4) and my [arabic blog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgBQX42jIOFkfnbHf1swP3GwDd0O-jzpjYYv63OjDRg/edit#heading=h.ofqm4bivlrj4) ) into a **Business Model**? \nThis question lead me to the first steps to establish a **vision-based Open Enterprise OE** startup called **ALBAYDER** in Palestinian territories with the **vision**: Build regenerative human-earth transformative ecology beyond borders through better form of work and business!\nALBAYDER should offer 2 main services; **self-organizing P2P** good businesses incubator and **crowdfunding platform** to finance these businesses and other local projects at firsthand, where the successful incubated projects will have the chance to be part of ALBAYDER OE.\nThe self-organizing characteristic  is applied from the methodology I put together to enable [open integral collaboration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aqiWAZKI5z2k1a3lcfCVzYDyn4854KWKRZLujBCnk4/edit), which can further developed for deep learning machine to allow peers to progress with minor mentors (MentM, Mentoring-Machine) involvements. \nUsing internet based solutions for connecting people through reality changing business ideas into an Open Enterprise will build a nation beyond boarders, a **Global Palestine**, a possible leading model for other Arabic countries and new humanity!\n\n@zmorda and @Sohayeb and all, as your program further developed than me, It would be great to collaborate to further develop the P2P incubator and find common supporter. If you agree, lets meet online to know each other better and see what best to be done together at the moment for the approach.

In it, I detailed some choices we have made in terms of naming the POPREBEL community 'Wellbeing in Europe', focusing on three main themes to start with (work, health, spirituality), as well as our thinking process. What is missing, and outside the scope of the report but very relevant to us, is how we expect to model theoretically the relationship between people's issues with forming of / reactions to populism.\n\nAs community builders, the approach is to expand our list of questions to participants after we hear life stories - asking how they view politics, how the issues affect their political choices and responses to the political offer. We hope to make the connection there. But is there any theory informing it?\n\n@Alberto is asking: Do you have a theory that \"populism arises when something is wrong with people's lives, for example work/health etc.\"? It sounds reasonable, but it's only just a theory, and not well supported by data at that. Competing theories: populism arises because it serves powerful interests, and the techniques exist to subvert hapless folks into joining the Brown Shirts; populism arises because people are inherently cruel. Maybe others.  If we have a theory of populism underpinning our work, that needs to be out in the open. What does @Jan think? \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome excerpts from the report:\n\n_In order to study the supply side of populist politics (see http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10066884/), we are engaging people &ldquo;where they are;&rdquo; and thus we are focusing on the demand side. We ask: What do people demand? Why? How? Where do they get the ideas to demand this and not that? How is their &ldquo;demanding&rdquo; anchored in their lives?_\n\n_To answer these questions in a compelling way, we contextualize them in a broader, engaging community narrative. The narrative is the ambitious story that points to where the whole effort converges, and is inclusive of the perspective of those we engage. The emphasis here is on how the project can contribute to bringing tangible benefits to those engaging in the conversation, with the added disclaimer that ours is a research project and partnership between different organisations._\n\n_Wellbeing in Europe is broadly introduced as following:_\n\n_&lsquo;We are on a journey to help one another to find the right ways to navigate the changes that are happening in Europe. How are we building good lives against a backdrop of massive social, economic, political challenges? How are we creating opportunities for ourselves and where can we support one another better? In work, health, family, community life.&rsquo;_\n\n_This narrative has the advantage of being general or inclusive enough for a wide range of participants to join in, by not politicizing from the get go, or by dismissing those on the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; end of the political spectrum. This is in line with our stated goal of engaging with people on all sides of the political debates, but doing it with a constructive and respectful approach. As per the Grant Agreement, we use the word &ldquo;populism&rdquo; with caution, as it has negative connotations in some cultures, and might discourage supporters of the populist agenda. This does not mean community members and community managers cannot use it - if anything it will be more contextualized in the conversations, and carry the added value of individuals representing themselves and not the project, in their contributions._\n\n_One of the biggest challenges is creating a conversation about topics which people care about and frame the output of the conversation in a way that makes it possible for groups to act on it. The entry point into the conversation is an invitation to participants to contribute. To that end, we identified a list of priority issues to cover multiple population groups; we agreed on a set of issues to start with, and then we framed questions to make connections between these issues._\n\n_Here is a snapshot of the thinking:_\n\n_We want to see a meaningful democratic debate, by connecting issues people care about with political discourse and action in their country i.e. for European elections; for national governments etc._\n\n_Societal problems are complex and quite common is that nobody knows what&rsquo;s going on, who can one trust, who are the authority figures._\n\n_What are issues many people care about? Work and health are at the core of meeting basic needs of wellbeing. Migration and travel are hot topics in the media, but they might not affect the core wellbeing of people._\n\n_Are there subterranean themes interesting to explore? the shift in religious beliefs, sources of existential angst i.e. crisis of masculinity_\n\n_Who could be the first ones to participate and help us understand better the national/ local contexts? How are others in a similar situation dealing with it?_\n\n_Where do we find them? What would be considered to be a fun activity? What would draw them to go to a meeting, to feel comfortable in that specific group? What do the members of the group have in common, what defines them culturally?_", "created_at": "2019-06-28 09:19:24.885299", "updated_at": "2019-06-28 09:19:47.792429", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 874, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55839, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10258, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I have a hunch that changing notions of masculinity/attitude towards/ expectations from the role of men in society...", "created_at": "2019-06-28 09:31:29.382112", "updated_at": "2019-06-28 09:31:29.382112", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 16.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55843, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10258, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@Jan see ^^", "created_at": "2019-06-28 10:04:46.922220", "updated_at": "2019-06-28 10:04:46.922220", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55840], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55840, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10258, "post_number": 3, "raw": "For example in xestern europe & north america we are seeing the rise of a men's rights movement and the associated online conversation is in a web somehow linked to conspiracy theorists, dogmatic free speechers, anti feminists, outright racists.

Comunque vada a finire, temo che le sue conseguenze riguarderanno non solo i protagonisti della storia (i 42 migranti raccolti dal Mediterraneo, il capitano della nave, le autorit\u00e0 italiane direttamente coinvolte e i loro leaders politici), ma tutti gli italiani. Queste conseguenze saranno fortemente negative. Potrebbero arrivare fino alla disintegrazione del senso di unit\u00e0 nazionale.\n\n**La ragione \u00e8 questa.** Le italiane e gli italiani sono esseri umani, e come a tutti gli esseri umani gli capita di surriscaldarsi durante una discussione. Di lasciarsi scappare una parola di troppo, e attraversare il confine tra il confronto e la lite.\n\n\u00c8 umano, e normale. Il luned\u00ec, i bar di tutta la penisola sono teatro di discussioni molto accese sulle partite di calcio del giorno prima. \u00c8 normalissimo sentire persone accusarsi a vicenda di \u201cavere rubato il rigore\u201d, \u201cavere corrotto l\u2019arbitro\u201d, o roba simile. Naturalmente, le persone in questione  non solo non erano in campo durante le partite in discussione, ma non erano neppure nel raggio di cento chilometri dallo stadio. Gli accusatori lo sanno bene, ma associano ugualmente il tifoso della squadra avversaria alle presunte scorrettezze commesse dai suoi dirigenti e dai suoi giocatori. **Il \u201cvoi\u201d contro il \u201cnoi\u201d, [secondo i biologi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection), sarebbe addirittura un tratto innato, parte dell\u2019evoluzione di *homo sapiens* .**\n\nNella discussione su Sea-Watch 3, avviene qualcosa di simile. Molti limiti di civilt\u00e0 e di correttezza sono stati passati. Spero che la mia percezione sia sbagliata, ma vedo il paese dividersi in due tifoserie. Il campo di questa partita \u00e8 quasi vuoto; ma i bar sono pieni di persone che insultano non solo i giocatori, ma gli uni gli altri. Le parole che leggo sono pesantissime. \u201cUccideteli\u201d, \u201caffondateli\u201d, \u201cdisumani\u201d e cos\u00ec via.\n\nPurtroppo, prevedo che l\u2019eco di queste parole rimarr\u00e0 con noi a lungo. **E questo ha a che fare con Internet.**\n\nDa un lato, Internet fornisce un archivio delle cose che condividiamo: la gioia e la rabbia, le opinioni misurate e argomentate e gli insulti e la frustrazione. E non dimentica niente. Se oggi usi la rete per chiedere l\u2019affondamento di una nave piena di povericristi, o dare del nazista al ministro tale o all\u2019onorevole talaltro, ti lasci dietro una traccia digitale che non sparir\u00e0 facilmente. Hai voglia a pentirti: quel post su Facebook, o tweet, ti rimarr\u00e0 appeso al collo come l\u2019albatro morto al vecchio marinaio di Coleridge.\n\nDall\u2019altro, i social media tendono a spingerci in \u201cbolle di consenso\u201d dove la maggior parte delle persone sono vicine alle nostre posizioni. [Secondo Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads), queste bolle tendono a diventare sempre pi\u00f9 estreme con il tempo e il consumo di social media.\n\n**Insieme, questi due effetti creano una situazione in cui le nostre prese di posizione pi\u00f9 estreme diventano una gabbia da cui non possiamo pi\u00f9 uscire.** Da una parte, esse sono incancellabili, o quasi, dalla memoria elettronica della rete: se cambi idea, devi sapere che tra un anno, o dieci, qualcuno potr\u00e0 *sempre* rinfacciarti quell\u2019insulto di cui ti sei pentito, quella posizione che oggi consideri sbagliata. Dall\u2019altra, averla espressa ti rende parte di una bolla che ti *premia* per quella posizione; ti ammira, ti rispetta come una persona che non ha paura di dire quello che pensa. In questa situazione, \u00e8 ancora pi\u00f9 difficile rimettersi in discussione.\n\nConclusione. **Ai tempi dei social media, quando in una comunit\u00e0 si forma una linea di frattura, essa tende ad allargarsi, a cristallizzarsi, a diventare irreversibile** . Diventa molto difficile perdonarsi a vicenda e riconciliarsi. \u00c8 quello che \u00e8 successo nel Regno Unito: nel 2015, le categorie di \u201cLeaver\u201d e Remainer\u201d non esistevano. Nel 2016 erano un\u2019abbreviazione che voleva dire \u201cuno che vota per/contro l\u2019uscita dall\u2019UE\u201d. Nel 2019 sono *identit\u00e0:* se andate su un sito di incontri per cuori solitari, lo troverete pieno di profili che dichiarano \u201cnon potrei mai uscire con un Leaver/Remainer\u201d. Queste identit\u00e0 sono *completamente inventate* , ma l\u2019effetto combinato di memoria incancellabile e bolle di consenso le rende efficaci, e anzi le approfondisce. Temo che, con la Sea-Watch 3, noi italiani abbiano trovato la nostra linea di frattura, la nostra Brexit.\n\nA breve termine, come mostra l\u2019esempio britannico, una divisione del genere sprofonda un paese in una continua guerra che risulta paralizzante. Dopo il referendum, infatti, il governo britannico non ha fatto sostanzialmente niente, nemmeno preparare la Brexit. A lungo? Nessuno lo sa. Temo che una comunit\u00e0 nazionale cos\u00ec divisa non sia sostenibile.\n\nE quindi? Io non conto niente, ne sono consapevole. **Ma se le mie parole avessero un peso, le userei per chiedere ai miei connazionali di essere compassionevoli non (solo) verso i migranti della Sea-Watch 3, ma anche gli uni verso gli altri** . Una persona pu\u00f2, in un momento di rabbia, dire una cosa orribile senza *essere* una persona orribile. Il \u201cnemico\u201d che ci sbeffeggia su Twitter \u00e8 una persona molto simile a noi, con una famiglia, l\u2019assicurazione dell\u2019auto da pagare, forse un cane. E un paio di strati dietro al suo linguaggio offensivo ci sono argomenti che valgono la pena di essere presi in considerazione.\n\nNessuno ha il monopolio dell\u2019italianit\u00e0. Ma a me piace ricordare questo: dopo la caduta del fascismo e la fine della seconda guerra mondiale, venne nominato un governo di unit\u00e0 nazionale. Ministro della giustizia era Palmiro Togliatti, il segretario del Partito Comunista Italiano. L\u2019atto pi\u00f9 significativo di Togliatti fu un decreto di amnistia, emanato in tempi molto rapidi. L\u2019amnistia copriva \u201ci reati comuni e politici, compresi quelli di collaborazionismo con il nemico e reati annessi ivi compreso il concorso in omicidio\u201d ([fonte](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnistia_Togliatti)).\n\nLe implicazioni di questa scelta erano enormi: chi era stato complice nel trascinare il paese in una guerra perduta, poi di collaborare con il nemico, veniva messo sullo stesso piano di chi non aveva commesso alcun reato, e non si era piegato all\u2019occupazione. Equo? No. E infatti Togliatti dovette pagare un prezzo alto in termini di consenso, anche all\u2019interno al suo stesso partito.  Ma il governo di unit\u00e0 nazionale, e lo stesso Togliatti, pensavano che la riconciliazione, il perdono reciproco, fosse l\u2019unico modo di procedere verso una nazione ragionevolmente coesa e stabile.

Both were legally voted, standard process, despite the propaganda, my opinion is that propaganda is able to gain 35 and 25 percent of votes, these come from Marek Prchal, PR specialist for our Prime minister.\n\nThe political campaign was full of propaganda, populistic slogans \u201eit will be better\u201c and so on\n\n_Why people vote for them?_\n\nBecause some kind of people like a simple statement, it is a typical mechanism of how populism can be strong, simple promises are understandable for 50 % of people on the left side of the Gaussian curve, it looks like it is enough\n\n_Do people look for some kind of empowerment?_\n\nIt is not so simple, I do not know why they need it, why they listen to it, they were unsatisfied with the political situation, perhaps they thought that the politicians cannot understand their problems, the former did understand, but did not care\n\n_What are the practical, daily-life problems you see in your country?_\n\nThe main sort is practical problems, if I am living in Vr\u0161ovice, I am meeting drug dealers, etc., there are no politicians who would do something. Common people live in their place, locally, and they do not feel relations to politicians who solve GDP, etc.\n\n_What are the main problems?_\n\nDemocracy is falling somewhere else. Our prime minister lies all the time \u2013 should not be possible, he steals European donations, he has gigantic possessions and he is a prime minister, and they are growing at velocity, which is much bigger than before. People support them because of the same principle nicely described in Monty Python \u2013 What have the Romans ever done to us? They keep on asking, what is EU giving us, and no answer is sufficient. Ok, so they give us roads and hospitals, but what else? \n\n_You said that the local politics in Prague work better - why is H\u0159ib (mayor of Prague), a better politician?_\n\nPeople in Prague are different, better informed. People outside Prague are watching commercial TVs, they cannot distill information. Prague is more educated, though it is not black and white, yet Zeman won in villages, the other candidate in cities\n\n_It is similar In Poland_\n\nIn Germany, the quality of the offer of the political parties is better, they would not support criminal as a prime minister\n\n_Why is it so in the Czech Republic?_\n\nTwo principles:\nthe first one is historical, after 1989 in the Czech Republic, there was no punishment of the former communists, practically none of them were arrested for criminal acts, as a result, people think it is ok to be like this\u2026, they could realize .. (they think) the communists really did not do bad work, but they did\n\nThe second is the so-called dark side of democracy \u2013 in my opinion, a lot of money can buy you voters\n\n_How about living in Prague, are the prices in the city a problem for a lot of people?_\n\nLiving in Prague is a problem, historically, a lot of flats were owned by the state, after that, the market was squeezed, a large part of the people was living in the regulated /cheap flats, it is not possible to maintain the low prices.

We are looking for a local connector to set up a community event in November 2019.\n\n**Europe is not well.**  In several countries, as many as 2 out of 5 young people are unemployed. Despite improved standards of living, poverty continues to be our reality - for youth and elderly, those living in cities and those on the countryside.\n\nThe economic and political reality of the generations before us has significantly changed and continues to change.\n\nWe feel anxious and unstable, resulting in a rise of alternative spiritual movements to help people cope.\n\nWe struggle with access to good, affordable care. We can\u2019t afford housing, and we can\u2019t afford to start a family.\n\nWe need to talk about it.\n\n**Wellbeing in Europe**  is a community effort where people from different countries meet and share ways to being well in this day and age.\n\nWe need your help to set up a community event in November 2019 in the Serbia, which is part of a series of events happening at the same time in Poland, Czechia and Germany.\n\nYou\u2019ll organize, facilitate and attract participants from different socio-economic groups, educational levels, professions, ages to discuss matters important to their wellbeing and the state of their city, country, neighborhood, family.\n\nIn order to be successful, the event uses a methodology for online/ offline community building developed by Edgeryders: in short, connectors need to ensure that all the participants share stories on the project\u2019s community forum and interact with each other through the comments before and after the event. This creates an authentic and constructive debate to lead to a wide community research analysis, and will help us build a long standing network across different European countries.\n\n## Your tasks will be:\n\nBEFORE THE EVENT:\n\n* Engage 50 people from different backgrounds in your village, town, city, country to join the community on [http://edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/), to share and post their stories on the community forum. The key topics for stories are: Healthcare and Social care services, Work and Prosperity, Spirituality and Morality.\n* Host a series of Virtual Cafes - online gatherings where people from other parts of your country and from other countries can meet and discuss together what they have learned from the stories that have been posted on the online community forum. The Cafes are announced on Facebook/ Edgeryders and other relevant channels, and the notes are posted to the forum.\n* Together with the people who you have brought into the online community and Virtual Cafes, produce the program for the local event.\n\nDURING THE EVENT\n\n* Ensure that the event is documented in writing and with video following the method and format you will learn by working with our international team.\n* Collect all the documentation material in one place and structure it well so that it is easy for those who could not come in person to participate in the discussion.\n\nAFTER THE EVENT:\n\n* Engage the participants to share their experiences of the event on the online platform\n* Write one article to summarise what happened, what was learned and your thoughts on the next steps, based on your experience.\n\n## How to apply\n\n1. Create an account on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/)\n2. Introduce yourself to the community by sharing a personal experience: [Add a New Topic here.](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/rs)\n3. Leave a comment to [3 community stories](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/) which are interesting and relevant to you.\n\nIf this it too difficult, write us at community@edgeryders.eu for more information. \nThis is an ongoing call with no deadline. When we will find the right candidate to hire, we will announce it here in a comment and close this call. \n\n## Estimated work time and remuneration\n\nThe contract is from September 2019 - June 2020, with 5000 EUR remuneration based on your deliverables. We estimate up to 3 days of work needed every week, depending on your own rhythm.\n\n## Who are we?\n\nEdgeryders is a non-profit organisation living in symbiosis with an online community of thousands of activists, researchers, innovators, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. We believe that a smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other\u2019s work.\n\nWellbeing in Europe is part of a Horizon 2020 funded Research and Innovation Action under the official name POPREBEL. The project focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The research considers content collected through [http://edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/), subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.\n\nThe project is funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 822682 from 2019-2021. Other partners are University College London (UK), University Karlova, University Jagiellonski (Poland), University of Belgrade (Serbia).\n\n## How we will select connectors\n\nWe are looking for someone who speaks both Serbian/ Croatian and basic English.\n\nWe will consider individuals who demonstrate an interest in Wellbeing in Europe; who are empathetic, curious and able to engage people from different walks of life in an authentic, constructive and respectful discussion about important topics.\n\nMost important, the connector is willing to collaborate with an international team and use online tools such as video chats for communication, engagement, documentation of work.\n\n## What happens if I am selected?\n\nYou will be working closely with the Edgeryders team to build the Wellbeing in Europe community conversation and the event series in your country.\n\nWhat happens if I am not selected?\n\nYou could get a 200 Eur reward for the story that you have contributed as part of the application process.

W 1988 r. - w wieku 8 lat - przeprowadzi\u0142am si\u0119 z rodzicami do mieszkania komunalnego w mie\u015bcie we wschodniej Polsce. Uczy\u0142am si\u0119 tutaj od drugiej klasy podstaw\u00f3wki, z przerw\u0105 w drugiej klasie zawod\u00f3wki. Wtedy rodzice przenie\u015bli mnie do zawod\u00f3wki odzie\u017cowej w lubuskim, bo wpad\u0142am w z\u0142e towarzystwo. Chcieli mnie odseparowa\u0107. To by\u0142 dobry pomys\u0142. Z\u0142e towarzystwo posz\u0142o w zapomnienie, szko\u0142\u0119 sko\u0144czy\u0142am. Potem w trybie eksternistycznym sko\u0144czy\u0142am liceum i - ostatnio - dwuletni\u0105 szko\u0142\u0119 policealn\u0105. W wieku 20 lat wysz\u0142am za m\u0105\u017c i urodzi\u0142am c\u00f3rk\u0119 . Zam\u0105\u017cp\u00f3j\u015bcie by\u0142o spowodowane ci\u0105\u017c\u0105.

Zanim urodzi\u0142am najm\u0142odszego syna pracowa\u0142am w sklepie spo\u017cywczym. Mia\u0142am umow\u0119 na 5 lat. Po p\u00f3\u0142 roku dowiedzia\u0142am si\u0119, \u017ce jestem w ci\u0105\u017cy. Odsun\u0119li mnie od pracy, bo nie mog\u0142am d\u017awiga\u0107 itd., a nie mieli innego stanowiska pracy dla mnie. I tak przez 4,5 roku przesiedzia\u0142am w domu. Najpierw na zwolnieniu. Chcia\u0142am po urodzeniu dziecka wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do pracy, ale syn urodzi\u0142 si\u0119 niepe\u0142nosprawny. Dosta\u0142am po urodzeniu dziecka urlop macierzy\u0144ski, wychowawczy, i tak przeci\u0105gn\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 do ko\u0144ca umowy. \n\nSyn urodzi\u0142 si\u0119 ze stopami ko\u0144sko-szpotawymi. Wada ta polega na tym, \u017ce nie rosn\u0105 \u015bci\u0119gna Achillesa tak szybko jak powinny. Syn od drugiego dnia \u017cycia by\u0142 w gipsie. Co tydzie\u0144 je\u017adzili\u015bmy do szpitala na zmian\u0119 gipsu. To trwa\u0142o 2 miesi\u0105ce. Potem naci\u0119li mu \u015bci\u0119gna i przez kolejne 6 tygodni ponownie mia\u0142 za\u0142o\u017cony gips. Trzeba by\u0142o uwa\u017ca\u0107 na u\u0142o\u017cenie n\u00f3g ca\u0142y czas. Po zdj\u0119ciu gipsu by\u0142a rehabilitacja. Je\u017adzili\u015bmy bardzo cz\u0119sto do szpitala. Dosta\u0142 te\u017c aparaty na nogi. Nosi\u0142 je 24 h na dob\u0119. Z przerw\u0105 jedynie na mycie i \u0107wiczenia, kt\u00f3re wykonywali\u015bmy te\u017c sami w domu. Jak zacz\u0105\u0142 chodzi\u0107, w wieku 13 miesi\u0119cy,  czeka\u0142a nas wymiana aparat\u00f3w. Co chwil\u0119 chodzili\u015bmy na rehabilitacj\u0119. Korzystali\u015bmy z publicznej opieki zdrowotnej. Wizyty by\u0142y co tydzie\u0144, co dwa miesi\u0105ce, a teraz co 6 miesi\u0119cy. Obecnie czekamy na wizyt\u0119, ale nie jeste\u015bmy zarejestrowani. Jeste\u015bmy w kontakcie telefonicznym bezpo\u015brednio z lekarzem. Lekarz da\u0142 nam sw\u00f3j numer prywatny z tego wzgl\u0119du, \u017ce gdyby co\u015b dzia\u0142o to mamy dzwoni\u0107. Niewa\u017cne jaka to pora dnia. Ale zbiera\u0142 te\u017c r\u00f3\u017cne dane do swojej pracy badawczej i dzi\u0119ki temu mieli\u015bmy te\u017c chyba nieco \u201echod\u00f3w\u201d. Chocia\u017c on jest takim lekarzem, \u017ce dziecku nie odm\u00f3wi. Je\u015bli nic z\u0142ego si\u0119 nie dzieje, a ma du\u017co innych pacjent\u00f3w, to prze\u0142o\u017cy wizyt\u0119 o miesi\u0105c i to wszystko. Rehabilitacja to co innego. Lekarz j\u0105 tylko zleca, a wykonuje si\u0119 j\u0105 w oddzielnym zak\u0142adzie rehabilitacji. Jest r\u00f3\u017cnie. Je\u015bli s\u0105 zaj\u0119cia indywidualne, to i dwa - trzy miesi\u0105ce mo\u017cna czeka\u0107. Je\u015bli nie ma zaj\u0119\u0107 indywidualnych, czeka si\u0119 ok. dw\u00f3ch-trzech tygodni. Ten czas robi\u0142 r\u00f3\u017cnic\u0119, bo wada si\u0119 rozwija\u0142a. Ona na okr\u0105g\u0142o wraca, dop\u00f3ki syn ro\u015bnie. Dop\u00f3ki ro\u015bnie, a \u015bci\u0119gna s\u0105 za kr\u00f3tkie, b\u0119dzie chodzi\u0142 na palcach.  Ja by\u0142am leczona inn\u0105 metod\u0105. W p\u00f3\u017aniejszym wieku mia\u0142am operacj\u0119 wyd\u0142u\u017caj\u0105c\u0105 \u015bci\u0119gna i odczuwam teraz b\u00f3l. Nie wiem jak on w przysz\u0142o\u015bci. Syn jest leczony cz\u0119\u015bciowo eksperymentalnie. Ten zabieg, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 przeprawadzony ostatnio standardowo jest wykonywany u dwumiesi\u0119cznych dzieci. U niego by\u0142 wykonywany w wieku 2 miesi\u0119cy i 9 lat. W p\u00f3\u017aniejszym wieku by\u0142 chyba leczony jako pierwszy w Polsce. Wiem ju\u017c, \u017ce nie zdecydujemy si\u0119 na taki zabieg drugiej nogi. Tym bardziej, \u017ce nie ma wielkiego efektu. Nadal chodzi na palcach. By\u0107 mo\u017ce ma a\u017c tak oporne \u015bci\u0119gna. \n\nMimo wszystko chodzi\u0142 do przedszkola i szko\u0142y publicznej, a w pa\u017adzierniku ubieg\u0142ego roku lekarz zleci\u0142 zaj\u0119cia indywidualne w domu ze wzgledu na ostatni zabieg i dlugi czas w gipsie. W pi\u0105tej klasie wraca do szko\u0142y. Syn jest w zwyk\u0142ej klasie. Maj\u0105 co prawda nauczyciela wspomagaj\u0105cego, ale dla innego dziecka. Ten nauczyciel pomaga te\u017c innym dzieciom. Syn ma dysklesj\u0119 i dysortografi\u0119. Ci\u0119\u017cko mu si\u0119 uczy\u0107. Ale testy psychologiczne w r\u00f3\u017cnych szko\u0142ach wychodzi\u0142y w porz\u0105dku. Z powodu leczenia mia\u0142 du\u017co przerw w nauce. Problemy zacz\u0119\u0142y si\u0119 w pierwszej klasie, gdy trudno by\u0142o mu si\u0119 uczy\u0107, pisa\u0107 literki, czyta\u0107.  Teraz nadrobi\u0142 troch\u0119 na indywidualnych zaj\u0119ciach. Leczenie jest bardzo drogie. Mimo refundacji, drugie tyle trzeba najcz\u0119\u015bciej dop\u0142aca\u0107. Koszty ponosili\u015bmy raz na rok, raz na dwa lata. Teraz ju\u017c rzadziej. Na przyk\u0142ad ostatnio wydali\u015bmy na aparaty 1, 5tys. Dop\u0142acili\u015bmy 400 z\u0142. Refundacja publiczna to zazwyczaj po\u0142owa albo 3/4 koszt\u00f3w. Jest ustalony jaki\u015b procent na jedn\u0105 nog\u0119, jaki maksymalnie mog\u0105 zrefundowa\u0107 w Narodowym Funduszu Zdrowia. Raz korzysta\u0142am z dofinansowania z Pa\u0144stwowego Funduszu Rehabilitacji Os\u00f3b Niepe\u0142nosprawnych. Zwr\u00f3cili 1 400 z\u0142 z 2 500 z\u0142. O mniejsze refundacje si\u0119 nie staramy, bo poprawi\u0142a nam si\u0119 sytuacja finansowa. Tym bardziej, \u017ce nie wiadomo by\u0142o czy nied\u0142ugo nie poniesiemy wi\u0119kszego wydatku, a NFZ finansuje aparaty raz na 3 lata.  \n\nKiedy\u015b korzysta\u0142am z dora\u017anej pomocy opieki spo\u0142ecznej, gdy odesz\u0142am od by\u0142ego m\u0119\u017ca. Korzysta\u0142am z zasi\u0142k\u00f3w celowych. Przez 3-4 miesi\u0105ce je otrzymywa\u0142am. Raz w roku dofinansowywali w\u0119giel. Z o\u015brodka pomocy spo\u0142ecznej dostawa\u0142am r\u00f3\u017cne kwoty zasi\u0142k\u00f3w. Czasem to by\u0142o 200 z\u0142, a czasem 800 z\u0142. Kwota zale\u017ca\u0142a od dochodu i od tego, ile instytucja mia\u0142a \u015brodk\u00f3w. Niestety zale\u017ca\u0142o to te\u017c od pracownika. Kiedy\u015b odm\u00f3wili mi pomocy w 8 miesi\u0105cu ci\u0105\u017cy. Powodem by\u0142a \u201era\u017c\u0105ca dysproporcja mi\u0119dzy przychodami a wydatkami\u201d. Przysz\u0142y do mnie dwie panie, przeprowadzi\u0142y wywiad i powiedzia\u0142y, \u017ce to jest niemo\u017cliwe, co\u015b jest nie tak. \u017be mam za du\u017co wydatk\u00f3w, a za ma\u0142o dochod\u00f3w. Fakt, \u017ce dochodu nie mia\u0142am wiele, a wydatki by\u0142y. M\u0105\u017c by\u0142 wtedy w wojsku. Mia\u0142am od niego 150 z\u0142 \u017co\u0142du plus dostawa\u0142am pomoc od rodzic\u00f3w. By\u0142am na ich utrzymaniu, bo nie mia\u0142am swoich pieni\u0119dzy. Wtedy jeszcze nie mia\u0142am aliment\u00f3w na c\u00f3rk\u0119. M\u00f3wi\u0142am to tym kobietom otwarcie, \u017ce rodzice nie s\u0105 w stanie mi ca\u0142y czas pomaga\u0107. Za stancj\u0119 wtedy p\u0142aci\u0142am 300-350 z\u0142. Mieszka\u0142am z c\u00f3rk\u0105 w zagrzybionym pokoju z kuchni\u0105. By\u0142a tam tylko toaleta i zimna woda. P\u00f3\u017aniej ju\u017c nie posz\u0142am do o\u015brodka pomocy spo\u0142ecznej w tej dzielnicy. Po przeprowadzce \u2013 w innej filii - trafili\u015bmy na pana, kt\u00f3ry o nas zadba\u0142 naprawd\u0119. Dzwoni\u0142 do mnie i m\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017cebym przychodzi\u0142a z podaniem, bo s\u0105 pieni\u0105dze na to, \u017ceby nam pom\u00f3c; organizowa\u0142 paczki dla dzieci, zaprasza\u0142 dzieciaki na  imprezy. To by\u0142o w 2010 roku. Jednym s\u0142owem, opieka zale\u017cy od osoby. Potem by\u0142o bardzo w porz\u0105dku, ale przestali\u015bmy korzysta\u0107 z pomocy spo\u0142ecznej. Nie chcia\u0142am nadwyr\u0119\u017ca\u0107 pomocy. Chcia\u0142am, \u017ceby\u015bmy w ko\u0144cu dali sobie rad\u0119 sami. Nie przymierali\u015bmy g\u0142odem. Na jedzenie by\u0142o, na czynsz by\u0142o, a na wakacje nie potrzeba by\u0142o. Tu nie chodzi o dum\u0119, ale mo\u017ce kto\u015b inny skorzysta. Po 2012 roku by\u0142o lepiej finansowo. M\u0105\u017c za\u0142apa\u0142 prac\u0119 i jako\u015b finansowo zacz\u0119li\u015bmy dawa\u0107 rad\u0119. Ca\u0142y czas korzystamy z dofinansowania do mieszkania. Czynsz mamy ok. 600 z\u0142, a dodatku mieszkaniowego jakie\u015b 430 z\u0142. Na wysoko\u015b\u0107 dodatku wp\u0142ywa ma\u0142y metra\u017c i du\u017ca liczba os\u00f3b w mieszkaniu. \n\n\nO mieszkanie te\u017c si\u0119 wystara\u0142am. Wcze\u015bniej mieszkali\u015bmy w jednej z dw\u00f3ch kamienic, co sz\u0142y do wyburzenia. Urz\u0119dnicy powiedzieli, \u017ce nic nam si\u0119 nie nale\u017cy, bo tylko wynajmujemy. Mamy szuka\u0107 kolejnej stancji. Ze wzgl\u0119du na niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015b\u0107 syna i na to, \u017ce ja nie pracowa\u0142am, tr\u00f3jka dzieci, pracowa\u0142 tylko m\u0105\u017c, z\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am podanie o mieszkanie do remontu. By\u0142am kilka razy u wiceprezydenta miasta. Miastu zale\u017ca\u0142o na szybkim wybudowaniu drogi w miejscu, w kt\u00f3rym mieszkali\u015bmy i ostatecznie znale\u017ali nam lokal zast\u0119pczy. Najpierw pokazali nam mieszkanie do remontu z takim pokojem, \u017ce nie zmie\u015bci\u0142abym wyposa\u017cenia dla jednego dziecka. A co z pozosta\u0142\u0105 dw\u00f3jk\u0105? Du\u017cy pok\u00f3j te\u017c nie nadawa\u0142 si\u0119, wi\u0119c zrezygnowa\u0142am z tego mieszkania. I w ci\u0105gu tygodnia dostali\u015bmy lokal zast\u0119pczy, w kt\u00f3rym mieszkali\u015bmy dwa lata. Potem zadzwoni\u0142 telefon z gminy, \u017ce jest mieszkanie do remontu, kt\u00f3re przyj\u0119li\u015bmy. W marcu minie cztery lata jak mieszkamy w\u0142a\u015bnie w tym mieszkaniu. Zg\u0142osili\u015bmy remont na 25 tys. z\u0142. Otrzymali\u015bmy wykaz koniecznych remont\u00f3w z administracji. Nie obchodzi\u0142o ich w jakiej cenie to zrobimy, byle by\u0142o zrobione. Nawet nie trzeba by\u0142o przedstawia\u0107 faktur. Nie sk\u0142ada\u0142am podania o mieszkanie komunalne, bo na nie bardzo d\u0142ugo si\u0119 czeka, a nas nagli\u0142o. Wiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce do remontu szybciej mo\u017cna dosta\u0107. To by\u0142o wywalczone, bo ca\u0142y czas nam powtarzali, \u017ce sami powinni\u015bmy sobie wynaj\u0105\u0107. A nas ani na kredyt ani na nic nie by\u0142o sta\u0107. Z rodzicami wsp\u00f3lnymi si\u0142ami jako\u015b wyremontowali\u015bmy mieszkanie od gminy. Powiedzia\u0142am od razu, \u017ce nie chc\u0119 niebezpiecznej dzielnicy ani pieca kaflowego ze wzgl\u0119du na dzieci. A s\u0142ysza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce jak wybrzydzasz i nie bierzesz mieszkania, jakie ci daj\u0105, po trzech odmowach trafiasz na koniec kolejki. To, kt\u00f3re mam teraz, nie jest rewelacyjne. Ni to blok, ni to kamienica. Ogrzewanie co prawda mamy centralne, ale wod\u0119 ju\u017c na gaz. Miesi\u0119cznie pr\u0105d i gaz kosztuje nas ok. 200-240 z\u0142 na 5 os\u00f3b. Nie narzekam, chocia\u017c nie sta\u0107 mnie na luksusowe wakacje albo na to, \u017ceby nawet na kilka dni wyjecha\u0107 nad morze. Du\u017co nie potrzebuj\u0119. W tej chwili pobieram od pa\u0144stwa zasi\u0142ek piel\u0119gnajcyjny na syna w wysoko\u015bci 153 z\u0142 i zasi\u0142ek rehalibilitacyjny 110 z\u0142, za wielodzietno\u015b\u0107 i ka\u017cde dziecko zasi\u0142ek rodzinny \u2013 w sumie 760 z\u0142. Plus 500 z\u0142 na dw\u00f3jk\u0119 dzieci. Nie przekraczamy kryterium dochodowego 1 200 z\u0142 na osob\u0119 w rodzinie, \u017ceby otrzyma\u0107 pomoc od pa\u0144stwa. U nas w rodzinie to jest faktycznie teraz doch\u00f3d ok. 500 z\u0142 na osob\u0119. Dop\u00f3ki nie posz\u0142am do pracy, to by\u0142 m\u00f3j doch\u00f3d, plus alimenty na c\u00f3rk\u0119. Kwot\u0119 2 100 z\u0142 mia\u0142am na dzieci. Plus m\u0105\u017c swoj\u0105 wyp\u0142at\u0119. Teraz kiedy zacz\u0119\u0142am prac\u0119, prawdopodobnie zostan\u0105 odebrane mi zasi\u0142ki. Zostanie nam 500 plus. Prawd\u0119 m\u00f3wi\u0105c ten zastrzyk pieni\u0119dzy bardzo nam kiedy\u015b pom\u00f3g\u0142. Mog\u0142am sobie pozwoli\u0107 na to, \u017ceby nawet sobie co\u015b kupi\u0107. Jeszcze korzystali\u015bmy ze stypendi\u00f3w szkolnych. Kupowa\u0142o si\u0119 rzeczy i zanosi\u0142o faktury do rozliczenia. Miasto zwraca\u0142o na ka\u017cde dziecko rocznie ok. 1000 z\u0142.  Poza tym korzysta\u0142am czasem z zasi\u0142ku celowego w szkole. W sumie to by\u0142o jednorazowo 300-400 z\u0142 na ka\u017cde dziecko. Przez rok korzysta\u0142am te\u017c z karty du\u017cej rodziny, a potem ju\u017c nie. Dla nas pomoc spo\u0142eczna by\u0142a wystarczaj\u0105c\u0105 pomoc\u0105. Je\u017celi bierze si\u0119 500 plus i \u017cyje z tego, mimo \u017ce mo\u017cna p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 do pracy - to jest nie w porz\u0105dku. Mi ono pomog\u0142o w czasie, gdy nie pracowa\u0142am i zajmowa\u0142am si\u0119 niepe\u0142nosprawnym synem. W ko\u0144cu trzeba wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do pracy. Dla siebie. Je\u015bli odbior\u0105 nam wszystkie zasi\u0142ki to trudno. Dzieci b\u0119d\u0105 mia\u0142y mimo wszystko szcz\u0119\u015bliwsz\u0105 mam\u0119. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce pociechy urosn\u0105, p\u00f3jd\u0105 swoimi drogami, a ja zosta\u0142abym sama w domu. Posz\u0142am do pracy dla siebie. Nie z powodu pieni\u0119dzy, bo w pracy dostan\u0119 wyp\u0142at\u0119, ale zasi\u0142ki mi zabior\u0105. Robi\u0119 to dla siebie. Dla dzieci te\u017c, bo jak siedzia\u0142am w domu, wyka\u0144cza\u0142am si\u0119 psychicznie. Teraz wysz\u0142am do ludzi. Zacz\u0119\u0142am szko\u0142\u0119, prac\u0119. Po prostu rozwijam si\u0119 w tym wieku (przyp.: 39 l.). Je\u017celi chodzi o 500 plus, uwa\u017cam, \u017ce powinno by\u0107 podniesione kryterium dochodowe. Chodzi mi o to, \u017ce bardzo bogate rodziny nie powinny dostawa\u0107 \u015bwiadczenia. Cz\u0119sto jednak jest tak, \u017ce matka samotnie wychowuj\u0105ca dziecko nie dostanie zasi\u0142ku. To jest niesprawiedliwe. Matka samotnie wychowuj\u0105ca dziecko zazwyczaj zarabia minimaln\u0105 krajow\u0105, czyli doch\u00f3d na osob\u0119 wynosi ponad 800 z\u0142, przez co traci prawo do 500 plus. Kryterium dochodowe powinno by\u0107 obecnie podniesione do min. 1 000 z\u0142. I wzrasta\u0107 wraz z podnoszonymi dochodami. Je\u015bli chodzi o alimenty to te\u017c, niby nie s\u0105 nigdzie brane pod uwag\u0119, a jednak wsz\u0119dzie s\u0105 wliczane do dochodu rodziny. \n\nNie interesuj\u0119 si\u0119 polityk\u0105, bo nie chc\u0119 si\u0119 denerwowa\u0107. Czasem g\u0142osuj\u0119.  G\u0142osowa\u0142am w jakich\u015b przedostatnich wyborach, chyba to by\u0142y samorz\u0105dowe. Nie g\u0142osuj\u0119, bo jest jak jest. Jakiej zmiany chcia\u0142abym? Ta sytuacja jest ok. Dajemy rad\u0119 z \u017cyciem. Nie sta\u0107 nas na wakacje, ale jakie\u015b rozrywki dzieciom mo\u017cna zapewni\u0107. Dobrze jest jak jest. Zazwyczaj g\u0142osuj\u0119 za m\u0119\u017cem. Tak jak on g\u0142osuje tak i ja. Je\u015bli bardzo mu zale\u017cy podaje mi nazwisko i g\u0142osuj\u0119.\n\nReligia by\u0142a wa\u017cna w moim \u017cyciu, dop\u00f3ki polityka nie wesz\u0142a na ambony. Przesta\u0142am chodzi\u0107 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Ostatnio by\u0142am jak syn bra\u0142 komuni\u0119. W sumie nawet nie wiem dlaczego t\u0119 komuni\u0119 bra\u0142. Chyba dlatego, \u017ce tak wypada. Nie jeste\u015bmy a\u017c tak bardzo religijni. Wierzymy, ale nic nie praktykujemy. Chocia\u017c i to wierzenie odchodzi coraz bardziej. Kiedy\u015b by\u0142 takie momenty, \u017ce chodzi\u0142am do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Wiem, \u017ce proboszcz z naszej parafii, je\u015bli p\u00f3jdzie si\u0119 do niego z pro\u015bb\u0105 o pomoc, zrobi wszystko, \u017ceby jako\u015b pom\u00f3c. Nie wiem na jakiej zasadzie, ale b\u0119dzie si\u0119 stara\u0142, \u017ceby jako\u015b pom\u00f3c. M\u00f3j syn nawet nie by\u0142 na rocznicy pierwszej komunii. Jako\u015b nie czujemy potrzeby chodzenia do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Zanikaj\u0105 obrz\u0119dy. Wiadomo, chodzimy na \u015bwi\u0119ta, co\u015b si\u0119 szykuje, ale te \u015bwi\u0119ta nie s\u0105 takie jak kiedy\u015b by\u0142y.S\u0105, bo s\u0105, dni wolne. Tak to odbieram. Moi dziadkowie,  rodzice mi to przekazywali, a ja po drodze to jako\u015b zaniecha\u0142am. Nie czuj\u0119 potrzeby na si\u0142\u0119 przekazania tego dzieciom. One jak wejd\u0105 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a, to jakby diab\u0142a wod\u0105 \u015bwi\u0119con\u0105 pola\u0107. Od razu wesz\u0142yby i wysz\u0142y. Warto\u015bci czerpi\u0119 od rodzic\u00f3w. Raz by\u0142o u nich lepiej, raz gorzej, ale jako\u015b nas wychowali. Mam trzy siostry jeszcze i jako\u015b wszystkie \u017cyjemy. Nie stoczy\u0142y\u015bmy si\u0119. Ojciec - by\u0142y ju\u017c - alkoholik, mama robi\u0142a wszystko, co si\u0119 da. Dwie z nas ma swoje rodziny, a siostry bli\u017aniaczki - du\u017co m\u0142odsze ode mnie - s\u0105 za granic\u0105. W Polsce studiowa\u0142y, by\u0142o im ma\u0142o, i rozjecha\u0142y si\u0119 po \u015bwiecie studiowa\u0107 dalej. Czy widz\u0119 zmian\u0119 w Polsce? Zazwyczaj zmiany s\u0105 przed wyborami, a potem do nast\u0119pnych wszystko ucicha. 300 plus, 500 plus... To pomaga. 1 000 z\u0142 na drodze nie le\u017cy. A za to dzieciom mo\u017cna naprawd\u0119 du\u017co kupi\u0107. Z racji tego, \u017ce dopiero wkraczam na rynek pracy, dla mnie najni\u017csza p\u0142aca jest wystarczaj\u0105ca. Co\u015b robi\u0119 i mam co\u015b swojego. Mam ok. 1 000 z\u0142 na r\u0119k\u0119 za sta\u017c, a dodatkowo minimaln\u0105 stawk\u0119 na godzin\u0119 u nowego pracodawcy. Nie siedz\u0119 tam tylko po to, \u017ceby godziny nabi\u0107, tylko siedz\u0119 i pracuj\u0119.

Unfortunately I think the only options are these:\n\n* Do not embed the videos but only link to them. Not good, obviously.\n\n* Create a video from the header image that contains _only_ that header image as a still image, and embed this first. Obviously, the thumbnail will then be the header image again. You can use the \"Hide details\" feature from the gear menu in this editor to hide the video \"somewhat\":\n\n\n    ```\n    [details=\"Summary\"]\n    video URL here\n    [/details]\n    ```\n\nThat should also \"fix\" it for Twitter. Twitter, Facebook etc. use the OEmbed protocol to determine what preview thumbnail to show, and probably Discourse provides them with the video frame due to the same bug you saw above.

For my discipline of origin, antitrust legislation and its application is the weapon of choice, because it studies large corporations and large corporation have an in-built incentive to collude (\"competition is for losers\"). Of course, antitrust became very difficult to do in recent decades, because most companies worth regulating transcend jurisdictions. I love [the example of Goldman Sachs](https://opencorporates.com/viz/financial/index.html) in the interactive visualization by OpenCorporates. Play with it, it's sobering. As a result of this and other phenomena, hardline antitrust decisions have all but vanished in America. No company was forced to break up after [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)... in 1984.  \n\nI have long believed that the EU finds itself in a privileged position, because it has stumbled across a way to regulate companies that are not in its jurisdiction. It is based on market access: \"if you want access to 500 million relatively affluent people, you have to play by our rules\". Some past commissioners, like Monti and Vestager, were able to regulate _American_ companies in the past. This is, IMHO, one of the strongest card that Europe possesses. \n\nThere have recently been calls to come down hard on some of the tech giants, as in \"break them up\", not just fine them ([one](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html), [two](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/06/regulating-big-tech-makes-them-stronger-so-they-need-competition-instead)). The antitrust rationale is clear: their position is no longer contendible. Textbooks, in these cases, recommend breakup or a tightly regulated monopoly, possibly nationalized. What would happen if the EU told Facebook that it has to break up or stay out of the European market? Either way, it would be competition-enhancing: if it did break up, we would have two or three companies instead of one. If it did not, we would have spectacular growth of alternative services based on their access to a market where Facebook itself cannot operate. \n\nThis might seem extreme, but, I repeat, it's actually industrial organization 101, and I find it worth considering.", "created_at": "2019-07-17 15:05:04.497074", "updated_at": "2019-07-17 15:05:04.497074", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 369, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 52.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56891, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10374, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@Jirka_Kocian can you check the translation and make sure it's ok?\n\nYou will see that I proposed a different application system: via email; we then onboard people manually - help them create an account and post their stories.\n\nIf the Application process works for you, should we change it for the local connector too?", "created_at": "2019-07-19 09:57:47.875641", "updated_at": "2019-07-19 09:57:47.875641", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 54, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56833, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10375, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Nice analysis @inge \n\nRegarding targeting, I've added that in my marketing analysis which is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwh0--FZAE8zHyJ3Yd4is3jiNfVChPlz03GzOOxdImI/edit?usp=sharing) (with general topic themes, as they are the base to research who and how to target).\n\nInformation that's in the document above is based on my analysis of people who already like Edgeryders and their friends (here I had an opportunity to use briefly Brandwatch for this, before my client canceled his subscription :( ).

Plenty of great workshops, including poliamory talks, were announced on the walls. I felt perfect there - but I also understood why the regulars found it alienating. My bad. ) and promoted the event in their networks. We had 75 interested people... and then it was raining cats and dogs the whole afternoon. It got clear right before the event started, and nobody came. What I have also noticed, is that young Czechs don't speak English very often - the initial idea was to hire a local person who'd accompany me, in case this would turn out true, but as we struggled to find them, a string of problems occurred. Nevertheless, I talked to all the workers of the space, told them about the call and was promised some help. \n\nNow, the second one was held in a hipster district of Prague, in a beautiful cafe that attracts a mix of middle-class people - old and young, left and liberal. This event was not promoted, so we were ready to step in with @Jirka_Kocian - my mission was to be a bait, go talk to people, ask them to join, and then conduct the conversation while Jirka took notes, and occasionally jumped in with some more specific questions, along with @kuba_svehla. I managed to find two people who'd share their opinions and who spoke English comfortably, a relief after numerous attempts a day earlier when I tried the same and young people would just refuse to have a conversation at all. \n\nNow, I know a lot of people who live in Prague - and only one of them is Czech. I got him on board to share the call, along with a couple of other people. Even if everyone admits that the project is interesting, and the offer we have is great for local standards, they're not really eager to get involved.

As with the previous interview, I tried to get people to point out some main issues - and while Jan had quite round political opinions, they both seemed to be just... fine with how things are, in a way. Or resigned? Can't point exactly what is the challenge here, but the little Czechs I had a chance to talk to would just accept the situation they way it is to some extent, do not feel terribly empowered to shake things up and make them easier. Anyway, off to what Peter told us :) \n\n_What do you do, what do you like to do in your life?_\n\nI am a huge traveler: I lived in Sydney, London, \u00a8and I am really into music like punk rock, grunge. I studied journalism. I only partly work as a journalist - mostly, we organize congresses for doctors, I am an event manager, organizing these things. But still I am at a junior position\n\n_Since when have you been living in Prague?_\n\nI got back four months ago, I feel great here. I have traveled a lot, but I really love Prague. There are a lot of great things here: public transportation, lots of parks, it is much more multicultural than it was, everyone speaks English, a lot Americans or Argentinians live here now, I have a flatmate from California.\n\n_And how is the job market in Prague?_\n\nI got back those 4-5 months ago, and it is really great, and I am not saying this because I have a national pride or anything, but there are just so many events, concerts, you have the freedom to drink your beer in the street, it just feels very free here.\n\n_How about the rents?_\n\nNot surprising for capital, but I can afford to live in the center of the city, not alone, but I can, unlike in London\n\n_So, what is not working in Czechia, is there something?_\n\nI feel like the education system could be better, it is important. My children will speak English because of my background, but it is not for everyone, schools in general should be providing this chance for everyone. Also, nurses and teachers are underpaid, for a job they are doing, and I think this is a problem. Czech teachers are mostly female and not so progressive, maybe they just lack the agency, the energy to fight for themselves. They should protest and push for their interests and I would support them. \n\n_Do you think it has to do with sexism, gender inequality in the Czech Republic?_ \n\nI am not a girl, so it's hard for me to tell, and I live in my bubble, so I do not know about other occupations/. The girls around me are very successful, emancipated, but I read about the problems of others\n\n_What else should be improved? How about the current political crisis?_\n\nI am sad about it\n\n_Why the people vote for the obviously corrupt and most probably criminal politicians to be in charge?_\n\nI do not know, but the gap within the society is growing ad it is not going to be better, the populists will remain strong.\n\n_Who did you vote for?_\n\nSecretly, I am a liberal, but my father thinks I am a leftist\n\n_In which way liberal?_\n\nHard to tell, for me education is important, but I also think we should keep the free market.\n\n_So what are the political differences between you and your father?_\n\nI think the background to which you are born is very important, which he disagrees with. He believes in the American dream of a sort. \n\n_Is it because of communist experience?_\n\nExactly. I think it is he is idealizing the USA because of this, the culture and so on, but we talked about it, and he started questioning it now as well.

Instead, \u201cParticulate matter can clog stomatal openings of plants and interfere with photosynthesis functions.\n[/quote]\n\nMmh but if the PM particles clog the stomata, then in principle leaves get them out of the air, right? If the PM pollution is not overwhelming the leaves, then the PMs will be eventually washed off by rain from them.\n\nI just became interested in the effect of trees on PM pollution, and I found that indeed they can remove PM particles because they collide in some way or another (impaction, interception and turbulence \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(aerosol_physics)#Dry_deposition)) with the tree and become stuck.\n\nBut the effect is moderate:\n\n> \"In urban areas with 100% tree cover (i.e., contiguous forest stands), average air quality improvements [\u2026] of the inleaf season were around two percent for particulate matter [\u2026]. In some cities, shortterm air quality improvements (one hour) in areas with 100% tree cover are estimated to be as high as [\u2026] 8% for particulate matter.\" ([source](https://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/other_publishers/OCR/ne_2006_nowak001.pdf), p. 117 / p. 3 in the PDF)\n\nSo 2% PM reduction with 100% forest cover. And much less for the 3 million trees Milan wants to plant. It's not zero, but also certainly not \"finally cleaning Milan's air\". Like you put it, \"what Stefano Boeri declares in the article isn't very accurate\".\n\nAnd there are additional complications and risks:\n\n> \"These estimates of air quality improvement due to pollution removal likely underestimate the total effect [\u2026] [because] forest canopies can limit the mixing of upper air with groundlevel air, leading to significant below-canopy air quality improvements. However, where there are numerous pollutant sources below the canopy (e.g., automobiles), the forest canopy could have the inverse effect by minimizing the dispersion of the pollutants away at ground level.\" ([source](https://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/other_publishers/OCR/ne_2006_nowak001.pdf), pp. 121 / pp. 7 in the PDF)\n\nThat's how even a simple thing like planting trees for air quality improvement becomes a kind of ecosystem design challenge \u2026\n\nAnd now some anecdotal evidence: I stayed for a lengthy time with my truck home in a small German village with an average of 6 km of forest in each direction (rough guess). That village was known for its clean air for many years and used as a climatic health resort while that trend was all the hype.\n\nIn other words, forests are great air filters for all kinds of air pollutants, but they need much more space for cleaning than the typical urban pollution-emitting area. That space is just not available in cities, because cities are for some reason always made very dense. \n\nIf, however, we'd go from 100% of forest cover (relative to the pollutant emitting urban area) to 5,000%, trees would clean 100% of PM air pollution. (I know I can't just extrapolate like that, but it should show the order of magnitude at least.) That would not be a city anymore but a forest with villages (to fulfill the requirement that we need 50 times more forest than settlements).

Onboarding the Polish new members**\n\nWe have plenty of new great stories, courtesy of Aska and Miko. As community managers, our goal is to connect people with each other and understand the issues at the deeper level.

Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 moich pogl\u0105d\u00f3w jest konserwatywna, ale je\u015bli chodzi o ekonomi\u0119, to tu niekt\u00f3re kwestie widz\u0119 lewicowo, je\u015bli tak mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107. PiS z reszt\u0105 te\u017c korzysta z takich lewicowych strategii. Obserwuje w przestrzeni publicznej, nie tylko w Polsce, wypychanie konserwatywnych warto\u015bci: tradycyjnej wizji rodziny, obyczajowo\u015bci.  Warto\u015bci tradycyjne s\u0105 wypychane i stara si\u0119 narzuca\u0107 warto\u015bci z lewej strony i sugerowa\u0107, \u017ce to jedyny s\u0142uszny pogl\u0105d. \n\nZaczyna si\u0119 nawet prze\u015bladowanie za pogl\u0105dy. Jak to by\u0142o ostatnio w przypadku Ikei, \u017ce zwolniono pracownika, bo cytowa\u0142 bibli\u0119. Ja mo\u017ce nie zgadzam si\u0119 z cytowaniem biblii w pracy, ale te\u017c nie zgadzam si\u0119, \u017ceby kto\u015b z tego powodu j\u0105 straci\u0142, czy by\u0142 w jaki\u015b spos\u00f3b za to prze\u015bladowany. Na Zachodzie za bardziej b\u0142ahe rzeczy mo\u017cna straci\u0107 prac\u0119. Za rzeczy zwi\u0105zane z religi\u0105. Albo w niekt\u00f3rych krajach rodzice mog\u0119 straci\u0107 dziecko, je\u015bli wychowuj\u0105 dziecko w spos\u00f3b konserwatywny. Ja w\u0142a\u015bnie sprzeciwiam si\u0119 takiej sytuacji, \u017ce nie ma miejsca na wyra\u017canie i praktykowanie zgodnie ze swoimi przekonaniami. Najgorsze, \u017ce nie ma dialogu mi\u0119dzy \u015brodowiskami, bo obie strony zamkn\u0119\u0142y sobie tak\u0105 mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107. I w tym momencie mo\u017cna tylko dawa\u0107 odp\u00f3r tym atakom na szeroko rozumian\u0105 prawic\u0119, albo si\u0119 podda\u0107. \n\nGeneralnie nie popieram \u017cadnej partii w tej chwili. S\u0105 partie, kt\u00f3rej elementy popieram. PiS - to taka partia systemowa, w kt\u00f3rej panuj\u0105 osoby zwi\u0105zane z postkomunizmem, a to dla mnie osoby, kt\u00f3re nie maj\u0105 bytu w polityce. A obserwuj\u0105c m\u0142odszych polityk\u00f3w widz\u0119, \u017ce to zmierza w kierunku szale\u0144stwa, \u017ce podam tu za przyk\u0142ad ruch antyszczepionkowc\u00f3w, czy tym podobne akcje, co w mojej ocenie jest bardzo szkodliwe dla prawicy. Moim zdaniem dialog kiedy\u015b istnia\u0142 kiedy warto\u015bci prawicowe przewa\u017ca\u0142y. W czasach PO mo\u017cna by\u0142o zauwa\u017cy\u0107 ofensyw\u0119 dyskursu LGBT, kt\u00f3re domaga\u0142y si\u0119 zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w partnerskich. Chocia\u017c nie uda\u0142o im si\u0119 tego osi\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 to pewne zmiany w Polsce nast\u0105pi\u0142y. Parady r\u00f3wno\u015bci s\u0105 coraz wi\u0119ksze. To jest bardzo widoczne w przestrzeni publicznej. W obecnej chwili oni domagaj\u0105 si\u0119 adopcji dzieci. Je\u015bli kto\u015b skrytykuje ten pomys\u0142, to nazywa si\u0119 go homofobem i jest to naznaczone bardzo negatywnie. \n\nCzy przeszkadzaj\u0105 mi \u015brodowiska LGBT? Ja widz\u0119 to w ten spos\u00f3b, \u017ce homoseksualizm by\u0142 zawsze, ale robienie z tego ideologii jest nieporozumieniem. Nie widz\u0119 w tym sensu, ale chyba chodzi tu o pieni\u0105dze. Wielkie korporacje nakr\u0119caj\u0105 ten temat. Ca\u0142a akcja jest o pod\u0142o\u017cu ideologicznym. Najpierw mia\u0142 miejce atak na god\u0142o, a p\u00f3\u017aniej atakowana symbol Matki Boskiej Cz\u0119stochowskiej, co jest jawnym atakiem na ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 i prowokacj\u0105 i to jest dla mnie niedopuszczalne. Atak na symbole to pomy\u0142ka. Co si\u0119 tyczy Ko\u015bcio\u0142a, to jestem za jego rozdzia\u0142em od pa\u0144stwa, ale gdyby to nast\u0105pi\u0142o teraz to zosta\u0142oby to wykorzystane przez \u015brodowiska lewicowe, w celu zwalczania ko\u015bcio\u0142a oraz samej wiary i duchowo\u015bci. \nTo os\u0142abi\u0142oby nie tylko Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, ale i ludzi. Warto\u015bci katolickie i moralno\u015b\u0107 zbudwana na ich podwalinach najlepiej oddaj\u0105 nasz\u0105 kultur\u0119 europejsk\u0105, Polsk\u0105 i rezygnacja z tego jest niepotrzebna. \nCz\u0142owiek szuka zawsze jakiej\u015b prawdy metafizycznej, wi\u0119c zawsze b\u0119dzie poszukiwa\u0142 tej duchowo\u015bci. \n\nW krajach laickich na Zachodzie ludzie id\u0105 np. w stron\u0119 islamu i to m\u00f3wi\u0119 nawet o ludziach bia\u0142ych. \u017beby by\u0142o ciekawiej nie nazwa\u0142bym siebie katolikiem praktykuj\u0105cym. Bli\u017cej mi to agnostycyzmu, ale uto\u017csamiam si\u0119 z ko\u015bcio\u0142em, jako cz\u0119\u015bci mojej kultury pochodzenia i czuj\u0119, \u017ce to jest dobre. Je\u015bli jestem zagadni\u0119ty za granic\u0105, czy Polak jest katolikiem, to przytakuj\u0119. I tyle. Ale wiem te\u017c jaki jest ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 jako instytucja. To zdegenerowany tw\u00f3r, dlatego chc\u0119 tego rozdzia\u0142u. I to mog\u0142oby si\u0119 wydarzy\u0107, gdyby nasze pa\u0144stwo by\u0142o zdrowe. \n\nPodatno\u015b\u0107 na wp\u0142ywy wszelakich ideologi jest zgubne. Co wi\u0119cej uwa\u017cam, \u017ce taki rozdzia\u0142 by\u0142by dobry dla samego ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Nie mia\u0142by Pa\u0144stwowych pieni\u0119dzy, nie mia\u0142by tak \u0142atwo, a przez to musia\u0142by si\u0119 sam oczy\u015bci\u0107. Od czasu zmiany w\u0142adzy mam poczucie marginalizacji ludzi o konserwatywnych pogl\u0105dach. A za tym idzie masowa imigracja, multikulturalizm, a z tym zwi\u0105zana jest ekonomia, kt\u00f3ra jest nastawiona na imigrant\u00f3w, \u017ceby utrzymywa\u0107 swoje tempo wzrostu. Narazie mamy imigracj\u0119 ukrai\u0144sk\u0105, ale z czasem mo\u017ce nast\u0105pi\u0107 imigracja z innych pa\u0144stw i kontynent\u00f3w (Bangladesz, Indie) i widz\u0119 w tym zagro\u017cenie. I to jest ciekawe, bo PiS m\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017ce jest przeciwko kwotom imigrant\u00f3w narzuconych przez UE, ale odpowiada za najwi\u0119ksz\u0105 imigracj\u0119 w UE, przy czym jest to imigracja zarobkowa. PiS jawi si\u0119 jako prawicowa, populistyczna partia i m\u00f3wi, \u017ce co\u015b robi, a tak naprawd\u0119 prowadzi Polsk\u0119 w bardzo z\u0142ym kierunku i nie wiem, czy z tego kierunku mo\u017cna zawr\u00f3ci\u0107. Proces imigracji np. z Ukrainy jest szkodliwy zar\u00f3wno dla samej Ukrainy jak i dla nas. Tutaj potrzebna jest jaka\u015b, jakakolwiek polityka, a wiem, \u017ce w tej sprawie nie robi si\u0119 nic. A to zrodzi w przysz\u0142o\u015bci problemy. Dodatkowo z ka\u017cd\u0105 imigracj\u0105 dochodzi do etnicznych spi\u0119\u0107, co wida\u0107 w relacji z Ukrai\u0144cami. \n\nW czasie Majdanu Polacy byli bardzo pozytywnie nastawieni do Ukrai\u0144c\u00f3w, da\u0142o si\u0119 zaobserwowa\u0107 wr\u0119cz wybuch pozytywnych emocji, a wraz z du\u017c\u0105 imigracj\u0105 zmienia si\u0119 to we wrogo\u015b\u0107, bardzo negatywne spojrzenie na ten nar\u00f3d, co mnie osobi\u015bcie bardzo boli. Ale tak jest z ka\u017cdym procesem imigracji masowej. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce ca\u0142a UE powinna temu przeciwdzia\u0142a\u0107. Ale Polska ekonomia jest teraz nastawiona na imigrant\u00f3w i jeste\u015bmy od nich uzale\u017cnieni p\u00f3ki nie znajdziemy alternatywy. Inna sprawa, \u017ce si\u0119 ich cz\u0119sto wykorzystuje i zaczynaj\u0105 walczy\u0107 o swoje prawa, dlatego zacz\u0119to sprowadza\u0107 pracownik\u00f3w w kraj\u00f3w najbiedniejszych, typu Bangladesz czy Indie. Nawet je\u015bli nasza gospodarka b\u0119dzie dzi\u0119ki temu dobrze funcjonowa\u0107 przez kilkana\u015bcie lat to nie znaczy, \u017ce w d\u0142u\u017cszej perspektywie to jest dla nas dobre.

Ja potrafi\u0119 rozmawia\u0107 z lud\u017ami o najbardziej odleg\u0142ych pogl\u0105dach od moich, ale nie wierz\u0119 w dialog mi\u0119dzy \u015brodowiskami.

Prawica jest w pe\u0142nej defensywie. Zaskoczeni? Lewica przedstawia obraz tak, \u017ce mo\u017cna odnie\u015b\u0107 wra\u017cenie, \u017ce faktycznie rz\u0105dzi prawica, ale jest na odwr\u00f3t. Na uniwersytecie, kt\u00f3ry ko\u0144czy\u0142em, pogl\u0105dy prawicowe s\u0105 bardzo zwalczane. \u015arodowiska lewicy s\u0105 tak silne, \u017ce t\u0142amsi si\u0119 wszelkie przejawy prawicowe. Co ciekawe PiS wcale nie jest parti\u0105 stricte prawicow\u0105: rozdawnictwo, kupowanie narodu, cofanie si\u0119 w kluczowych kwestiach, jak cho\u0107by tych dotycz\u0105cych aborcji o tym \u015bwiadcz\u0105. Ja mo\u017ce nie jestem za zaostrzeniem, ale PiS te\u017c cz\u0119sto si\u0119 cofa jak w tym przypadku, bo ulegli protestom. \n\nPoza tym PiS jest typowo prawicowo populistyczn\u0105 parti\u0105 i stara si\u0119 zmonopolizowa\u0107 kwestie prawicy, dlatego zwalcza inne \u015brodowiska bardziej prawicowe (nacjonalistyczne, narodowe, patriotyczne). Co ciekawe za PO nie dochodzi\u0142o do zaostrzania prawa, np. za propagowanie faszyzmu. Nie istnia\u0142a taka kwestia. Te\u017c nie zwalczano czynnie \u015brodowiska narodowe, nawet je\u015bli dochodzi do zamieszek. Tak\u017ce PiS tylko w tym szerszym znaczeniu jest prawic\u0105, ale to jest dok\u0142adnie taka prawica jakiej nie lubi\u0119- polityczna, populistyczna, hipokrytyczna. Reasumuj\u0105c uwa\u017cam, \u017ce obecnie raczej nie ma miejsca na dialog i b\u0119dzie mia\u0142a miejsce dalsza polaryzacja spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa, a to za sob\u0105 ci\u0105gni\u0119 coraz wi\u0119ksz\u0105 agresj\u0119 i narzucanie innym swoich pogl\u0105d\u00f3w.

There might be some kind of tiredness creeping into us, but this also might be in my little bubble and limited perspective) or attent other events that attract people who we'd like to encourage to join\n\n- look for activists on the spectrum of political opinions - Asia is trying to do that for example, Miko\u0142aj relies on personal connections\n\n- look for people who live on the internet :smiley:\n\n- don't worry about having too many grandmas without emails: this research is not sociological research as it misses some of the important data, but the key would be to bring stories from as many walks of life as we can find.  It does not have to be extremely representative, just offer a wide range of views. \n\nLater on, we can move to organize the event and promoting its subjects and the stories underpinning them in order to get people to talk. We will make it into an interesting space for people to come and share their stories, experiences and connect with people who do relevant work/have similar situations - this is an invitation, as the tickets can't be bought, but they're acquired by participation in the discussion and communal building of the project. \n\nLet me know what is missing here.

Most of it is done, and Inge and I will ping you if we'd need any more help (30mins/ week)\n2) Each of us leaves a thoughtful comment to 3 stories in any subforum - even if the stories are different language from your own. Write in English or use machine translation. In your comment, please ping other Poprebel community members who might be interested in the story. We need to get better at connecting people. Right now the easiest is the Polish forum, where there are many stories without comments :-( (1-2 hrs/week)\n3) Provide link + quote from 3 stories into the [social media spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XBes-2S2WKox4hMTwA4DqbnHB0a2CdaB4sYj2N_BD8A/edit#gid=1105891851) (30 mins/week). Feel free to pick stories to share through your social media! We will also ping you in[#CountOnMe](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire) edgeryders news updates that you can share. \n4) Come to the Wednesdays community calls: we will do only 2 calls in August - mid month on the 14th, and end of the month on the 28th, both on Wednesdays at 18:00 CET in the usual space [on Zoom.](https://zoom.us/s/406268838) (1hr/biweekly)\n5) For Natalia and local connectors only: by mid August please publish a new topic with calendar of Virtual Cafes in Polish, with dates, topic, name of expert, photo and for each event create event pages on facebook.

Poczu\u0142em wtedy, \u017ce nie jestem sam. \n\nJe\u015bli chodzi o moj\u0105 rodzinn\u0105 sytuacj\u0119, to m\u00f3j ojciec by\u0142 bardzo agresywny i to by\u0142o szczeg\u00f3lnie trudne dla mojego starszego brata i mojej matki. To odcisn\u0119\u0142o pi\u0119tno na naszej psychice. M\u00f3j brat potrzebowa\u0142 wielu lat, \u017ceby doj\u015b\u0107 do siebie. Nigdy nie zdecydowa\u0142 si\u0119 na terapi\u0119. M\u00f3j ojciec by\u0142 nieobecny i w dodatku agresywny Ja wiele rzeczy t\u0142umi\u0142em w sobie i one nie wychodzi\u0142y na wierzch. Matka by\u0142a chyba najbardziej poszkodowana w tym wszystkim. To taki typ Si\u0142aczki.\n\nNie zdecydowa\u0142em si\u0119 na terapi\u0119, bo uda\u0142o mi si\u0119 jako\u015b pouk\u0142ada\u0107 to samemu. M\u00f3j brat bardzo mi w tym pom\u00f3g\u0142. By\u0142 pierwsz\u0105 osob\u0105, kt\u00f3remu przyzna\u0142em si\u0119, \u017ce jestem gejem. On by\u0142 zawsze dla mnie du\u017cym wsparciem. Po tym jak wreszcie TO komu\u015b powiedzia\u0142em, poczu\u0142em niesamowity spadek formy ocieraj\u0105cy si\u0119 o depresj\u0119. To by\u0142 ci\u0119\u017cki czas. Ale brat da\u0142 mi dok\u0142adnie takie wsparcie jakiego potrzebowa\u0142em. P\u00f3\u017aniej dowiedzia\u0142y si\u0119 inne osoby: matka, ojciec. Uzna\u0142em, \u017ce skoro chc\u0119 normalnie funkcjonowa\u0107, to musz\u0119 zacz\u0105\u0107 od rodziny. Ojciec mo\u017ce nie by\u0142 tym zachwycony, ale jak na niego to zareagowa\u0142 nawet do\u015b\u0107 dobrze. Inna sprawa, \u017ce ju\u017c by\u0142em od niego niezale\u017cny i nie m\u00f3g\u0142 mi nic zrobi\u0107, to w pewnym sensie by\u0142o dla mnie \u0142atwiejsze. \n\nBycie w spo\u0142eczno\u015bci, te\u017c jako dzia\u0142acz, by\u0142o dla mnie wa\u017cnym elementem dochodzenia do samo\u015bwiadomo\u015bci, w sensie obywatelskim, politycznym. Ta dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 w grupie lgbt by\u0142a dla mnie elementem ugruntowywania mojego \u015bwiatopogl\u0105du. P\u00f3\u017aniej zapisa\u0142em si\u0119 do partii Razem, co te\u017c by\u0142o wa\u017cnym elementem rozwoju. Wszystko zmieni\u0142o si\u0119 jak odwa\u017cy\u0142em si\u0119 stan\u0105\u0107 za sob\u0105, przyzna\u0107 si\u0119 do swojej seksualno\u015bci- to by\u0142a taka cezura. Za tym posz\u0142a zmiana osobowo\u015bciowa, nabranie pewno\u015bci siebie, ale to by\u0142 proces oczywi\u015bcie. \n\nMy\u015bl\u0119 \u017ce teraz nie \u017cyje mi si\u0119 dobrze w Polsce, gdy widz\u0119 co si\u0119 dzieje. Czuj\u0119  niepok\u00f3j nie tylko o spo\u0142eczno\u015b\u0107 lgbt, ale te\u017c dotycz\u0105ca zmian klimatycznych, \u017ce nic si\u0119 z tym nie robi. Martwi mnie to.\nKryzys roku 2008 w mojej ocenie spowodowa\u0142 radykalizowanie si\u0119 nastroj\u00f3w. Mam takie poczucie, \u017ce czasem im bardziej wychodzisz poza przyj\u0119te ramy spo\u0142eczne, im bardziej wy\u0142amujesz si\u0119 w innych obszarach, tym mniej spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo ma dla Ciebie akceptacji. Nie mam w sobie zbyt du\u017co optymizmu co do naszej przysz\u0142o\u015bci. Lepiej si\u0119 rz\u0105dzi, kiedy spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo jest podzielone, a spo\u0142eczno\u015b\u0107 lgbt jest idealnym koz\u0142em ofiarnym.", "created_at": "2019-08-02 13:21:32.723979", "updated_at": "2020-01-03 10:40:11.917809", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 798, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 48.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [137, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57504, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10463, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Global south, because everyone is developing all the time :)", "created_at": "2019-08-02 15:13:30.409969", "updated_at": "2019-08-02 15:13:30.409969", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4986], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57766, "user_id": 4794, "topic_id": 10462, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Cze\u015b\u0107 @Adam1!

Pomieszkiwali\u015bmy tam, gdzie mia\u0142 prac\u0119, a od 1975 roku \u2013 od 4 roku \u017cycia - mieszkam ca\u0142y czas w tym samym miasteczku. Sko\u0144czy\u0142em tu szko\u0142\u0119 podstawow\u0105. Potem chodzi\u0142em dwa lata do technikum rybackiego, ale inne rzeczy mnie interesowa\u0142y i nie uda\u0142o si\u0119... Wagary, te sprawy, wyjazdy. Po prostu szko\u0142a mnie nie interesowa\u0142a. Pracuj\u0119 od 1989 roku. Pierwsza praca by\u0142a w piekarni GS (przyp.: gminna sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia) 20 km od domu. Sam uczy\u0142em si\u0119 piec. Pracowa\u0142em z tat\u0105, ale po wojsku wr\u00f3ci\u0142em tutaj. By\u0142em w wojsku 535 dni dok\u0142adnie. To by\u0142a obowi\u0105zkowa s\u0142u\u017cba. Nie da\u0142o rady si\u0119 wymiga\u0107, ale nie narzekam. By\u0142em w plutonie wartowniczym. Je\u017adzi\u0142o si\u0119 do lasu na warty. Cisza, spok\u00f3j, tak jak tutaj teraz. I tak zlecia\u0142o 1,5 roku. Mam 20 lat legalnej pracy na 48 lat mojego \u017cycia. Troch\u0119 tam by\u0142o i na czarno. Dwa razy by\u0142em na truskawkach w Niemczech. By\u0142em troch\u0119 pod Warszaw\u0105 na betonach, ale to jest taki kr\u00f3tki epizod. \n\nZostali\u015bmy z mam\u0105 tylko we dwoje, a kobieta jest ju\u017c wiekowa. Jak kto\u015b jest w domu, to zawsze inaczej. Dlatego st\u0105d nie wyjecha\u0142em. Mia\u0142em 42 lata jak tata zmar\u0142. Mama ma najni\u017csz\u0105 emeryturk\u0119, tj.: niewiele ponad 800 z\u0142 na r\u0119k\u0119. I tyle co ja do\u0142o\u017c\u0119 \u2013 najni\u017csz\u0105 \u2013 1 500 z\u0142. Zawsze zarabia\u0142em tak samo. W GS pracowa\u0142em na trzy zmiany po osiem godzin. Tutaj \u2013 18 godzin zaliczy\u0142em ostatnio. R\u00f3\u017cnie pracuj\u0119. U mnie nie ma tak, \u017ce 10 godzin zawsze. To zale\u017cy od zam\u00f3wienia. Teraz s\u0105 wakacje. Nie bior\u0105 szko\u0142y. Nie bior\u0105 dro\u017cd\u017c\u00f3wek, nie bior\u0105 bu\u0142ek. To ju\u017c odchodzi. Pracuj\u0119 sze\u015b\u0107 dni w tygodniu, jak nie ma \u017cadnych \u015bwi\u0105t. Nie mam codziennie 18 godzin, ale na Bo\u017ce Cia\u0142o by\u0142a kumulacja i 18 godzin zaliczy\u0142em. \u015arednio pracuj\u0119 10 godzin maksymalnie. Najcz\u0119\u015bciej pracuj\u0119 od po\u0142udnia do 22:00. Dostaj\u0119 dodatkowe wynagrodzenie za nadgodziny i \u015bwi\u0119ta. R\u00f3\u017cnie, ale zawsze jaka\u015b promocja jest. Nie da si\u0119 tego przeliczy\u0107 na godzin\u0119. GS by\u0142 pa\u0144stwowy, a teraz pracuj\u0119 u prywaciarza. Nie wiem czy jest gorzej czy lepiej... Wcze\u015bniej pracowa\u0142em 8 godzin, do domciu i nic ci\u0119 nie obchodzi\u0142o. Nast\u0119pna zmiana. A teraz nie ma ludzi do pracy. Kolega m\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017ce w wojew\u00f3dztwie jest 3 000 piekarni i w ka\u017cdej mo\u017cna znale\u017a\u0107 prac\u0119. Nie ma ch\u0119tnych do tego. Czasami wykorzystuj\u0119 urlop w roku, ale nie zawsze, i nie ca\u0142y, bo nie ma ludzi po prostu. Ekwiwalent finansowy dostaj\u0119 za niewykorzystany urlop. By\u0142 ostatnio cz\u0142owiek, kt\u00f3ry potrafi pracowa\u0107 na piekarni, to sobie odpocz\u0105\u0142em. Jestem jednocze\u015bnie zarejestrowany w urz\u0119dzie jako bezrobotny. Nie narzekam na wynagrodzenie. Nie za wiele si\u0119 da z tego od\u0142o\u017cy\u0107. W \u017cyciu by\u0142em osiem dni na zwolnieniu. Chodzi\u0142em czasem przezi\u0119biony do pracy. Ci\u0119\u017ckich chor\u00f3b nie przechodzi\u0142em. \n\nMieszkam z mam\u0105, ale mam syna. Nigdy nie p\u0142aci\u0142em aliment\u00f3w. Nie dok\u0142adam si\u0119 do utrzymania, bo syn jest pe\u0142noletni, 20-latek. Pracuje. Wcze\u015bniej si\u0119 dok\u0142ada\u0142em bez \u017cadnego s\u0105du. Nie wiem czy K. korzysta\u0142a z pomocy spo\u0142ecznej, bo rozstali\u015bmy si\u0119 wiele lat temu. Kontakt utrzymywali\u015bmy, ale na takie tematy nie rozmawiali\u015bmy. \n\nNie by\u0142oby mi \u0142atwo zmieni\u0107 prac\u0119. Ca\u0142e \u017cycie jestem piekarzem. W moim wieku si\u0119 przebran\u017cowi\u0107 ci\u0119\u017cko by by\u0142o. Nigdy o tym nie my\u015bla\u0142em ani nie dostawa\u0142em takich ofert. Teraz te\u017c ich nie dostaj\u0119 w urz\u0119dzie. \n\nNie chodz\u0119 do lekarza. Mamu\u015bka korzysta z opieki zdrowotnej publicznej, a  ostatnio skorzysta\u0142a z prywatnej \u2013 zrobi\u0142a sobie okulary. Nie na NFZ, bo termin wizyty m\u00f3g\u0142 by\u0107 najbli\u017cej w grudniu.\n\nJestem wierz\u0105cy. Nie chodz\u0119 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Wierz\u0119 w co\u015b, pomodli\u0107 to si\u0119 mog\u0119 i w domu, jak chc\u0119. Po co mi potrzebny jaki\u015b od\u0142am...? Nie jestem antyklerykalny, chocia\u017c przesadzaj\u0105 troszeczk\u0119 ksi\u0119\u017ca. Znam paru fajnych ksi\u0119\u017cy. Szczeg\u00f3lnie ci biskupowie, nie wiem jak to okre\u015bli\u0107... Tacy naburmuszeni, nic nie mo\u017cna im powiedzie\u0107. Znam takiego ksi\u0119dza co porozmawia, przybije pi\u0105tk\u0119, za\u017cartuje.

Z\u0142ym cz\u0142owiekiem nie jestem, ale mo\u017ce co\u015b jest, mo\u017ce kto\u015b stworzy\u0142 co widzimy. Nie ma tak, \u017ce jak trwoga, to do boga. Codziennie si\u0119 modl\u0119. W \u017cyciu wa\u017cni s\u0105 dla mnie przyjaciele, rodzina. Dobrzy ludzie w og\u00f3le. To jest dla mnie wa\u017cne. Ciesz\u0119 si\u0119 jak spotykam dobrych ludzi, przyjaznych itd. Chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby wszystkim by\u0142o dobrze, \u017ceby cieszyli si\u0119 tym \u015bwiatem, t\u0105 przyrod\u0105, kt\u00f3r\u0105 kocham. To jest dla mnie wa\u017cne. Nie pieni\u0105dze \u017beby po prostu by\u0107 dla siebie cz\u0142owiekiem. To jest dla mnie wa\u017cne... Teraz nie jest dobrze. Jest kupa plugastwa i takich innych rzeczy a\u017c jad tryska czasami od ludzi. To mi si\u0119 nie podoba. Czasami ten jad odczuwam. Ludzie pluj\u0105 na siebie, nie wiadomo o co. Tacy jeste\u015bmy. Cz\u0142owiek ma to tak w naturze. Zwierz\u0119 to rozumie. Atakuje, bo jest g\u0142oodne, a cz\u0142owiek atakuje drugiego, bo chce. To wszystko jest w naszych g\u0142owach. To mo\u017cemy zmieni\u0107 tylko. Ka\u017cdy powinien zacz\u0105\u0107 od siebie. \n\nNie by\u0142em nigdy w \u017cyciu na \u017cadnych wyborach, bo jak sobie w\u0142asnymi r\u0119kami nie wygarn\u0119 par\u0119 groszy, to \u017cadna opcja polityczna mi nie da - jaka by nie by\u0142a. Nie czuj\u0119, \u017ce co\u015b si\u0119 zmienia, jak zmienia si\u0119 partia. Jak by\u0142o, tak jest i nic si\u0119 nie zmieni. Jeszcze jak po\u017cyj\u0119 par\u0119 lat, to kto\u015b za 500 plus b\u0119dzie musia\u0142 zap\u0142aci\u0107. Czyli ja mi\u0119dzy innymi. Da\u0107 to nie sztuka. Pieni\u0105dz musi mie\u0107 pokrycie. Sk\u0105d\u015b trzeba go wzi\u0105\u0107. Kto\u015b go musi wypracowa\u0107. A teraz nie ma ludzi do pracy. Du\u017co wyjecha\u0142o za granic\u0119 i oni te\u017c troszeczk\u0119 nap\u0119dzaj\u0105 t\u0119 koniunktur\u0119. Przyjad\u0105 na \u015bwi\u0119ta... Tak ten kraj funkcjonuje. Kiedy\u015b w ko\u0144cu padnie. B\u0119dziemy jak Argentyna kiedy\u015b, jak Stany Zjednoczone w 30. latach. No dobra, matka dosta\u0142a trzynastk\u0119 do emerytury za tyle przepracowanych lat. To tona w\u0119gla. Politycy nic nie zmieni\u0105, bo my\u015bl\u0105 tylko o sobie, a nie o kim\u015b. Nie ma dobrych wujk\u00f3w. Aby ich wybra\u0107... Co zrobi\u0107 \u017ceby by\u0142o dobrze? Po prostu by\u0107 lud\u017ami dla siebie. Ja mu zawsze pomog\u0119, a on mi. Jestem anarchist\u0105. To wszystko przesadzone \u2013 bezw\u0142ad, chaos \u2013 jak w s\u0142owniku pisze. Chc\u0119 dobrze dla ludzi. \u017beby ka\u017cdemu cz\u0142owiekowi na tym \u015bwiecie by\u0142o jak najlepiej. To jest dla mnie anarchizm. Ja nie mam \u017cadnego problemu.

Sama zaczynam by\u0107 ju\u017c bardzo zm\u0119czona... Gdy wchodz\u0119 na fb zaczynam mie\u0107 odruchy wymiotne, bo wszystko na moim wallu jest nacechowane negatywnie: ataki rasistowskie, przemoc na tle islamofobii czy homofobii, ohydne s\u0142owa polityk\u00f3w podsycaj\u0105cych wci\u0105\u017c do walki. Obserwuj\u0105c to wszystko co si\u0119 u nas dzieje do\u015bwiadczam bezsilno\u015bci i bezradno\u015bci. Dlatego zaczynam szuka\u0107 bezpieczniejszych temat\u00f3w, bardziej pozytywnych, wzmacniaj\u0105cych, bo sama ju\u017c jestem zm\u0119czona tym grzebaniem si\u0119 w trudnych rzeczach. Poza tym na projekty, kt\u00f3re realizuj\u0119 trudno jest zdoby\u0107 fundusze. No i wci\u0105\u017c trzeba uwa\u017ca\u0107 na wizerunek, bo np. miasto mo\u017ce nam wym\u00f3wi\u0107 lokal albo w inny spos\u00f3b utrudni\u0107 nam funkcjonowanie. \n\nOstatnio ten l\u0119k jest znacznie wi\u0119kszy, ni\u017c wcze\u015bniej. Boj\u0119 si\u0119 o swoj\u0105 prac\u0119, dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107, ale i po prostu - o przysz\u0142o\u015b\u0107. Gdzie b\u0119d\u0119 za rok, za pi\u0119\u0107 lat? Jestem postrzegana jako pewna siebie fajterka, ale czasem te\u017c brak mi si\u0142. Ostatnio pr\u00f3bowa\u0142am wej\u015b\u0107 do szk\u00f3\u0142 z tematem warsztat\u00f3w antydyskryminacyjnych i nie spotka\u0142o si\u0119 to z otwarto\u015bci\u0105, cho\u0107 uwa\u017cam, \u017ce problem przemocy w\u015br\u00f3d m\u0142odzie\u017cy (i wiem to w\u0142a\u015bnie od m\u0142odzie\u017cy!), jest bardzo pal\u0105cy. Niestety cz\u0119sto jestem osamotniona w tym, jak dzia\u0142am. Nie mog\u0119 liczy\u0107 na wsparcie instytucji publicznych, poniewa\u017c np. w\u0142odarze mojego miasta, ba! kurator o\u015bwiaty twierdzi, \u017ce: \"U nas w szko\u0142ach nie ma problemu z dyskryminacj\u0105 na jakimkolwiek tle\". Ponadto politycy twierdz\u0105, \u017ce  przemoc - szczeg\u00f3lnie ta na tle homofobii - pojawia si\u0119 dopiero wtedy, kiedy ludzie organizuj\u0105 Marsze R\u00f3wno\u015bci. Skoro ma takie podej\u015bcie do tematu, to wiadomo, \u017ce niewiele si\u0119 tutaj da zrobi\u0107. Z innej strony - nasz prezydent zaraz po tym jak odm\u00f3wi\u0142 zgody na Marsz R\u00f3wno\u015bci stwierdzi\u0142, \u017ce zorganizuje w przysz\u0142ym roku festiwal r\u00f3wno\u015bci. Mam nadziej\u0119, \u017ce zostaniemy zaproszeni na to wydarzenie z t\u0119czowymi flagami. Ale nie \u0142udz\u0119 si\u0119 na mi\u0142e przyj\u0119cie. \n\nW moim mie\u015bcie m\u00f3wi si\u0119 o autorytecie Jana Paw\u0142a II, o zdrowej rodzinie, zdrowym spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie, patriotyzmie. Taki jest przekaz. Nie ma miejsca na dyskusj\u0119, co naprawd\u0119 te warto\u015bci dla r\u00f3\u017cnych ludzi znacz\u0105, co si\u0119 pod nimi kryje. Ludzie boj\u0105 si\u0119 wychyli\u0107, bo mog\u0105 mie\u0107 z tego powodu problemy. Jak si\u0119 nie wychylisz, to b\u0119dzie ci si\u0119 troch\u0119 lepiej \u017cy\u0142o. Lepiej uwa\u017ca\u0107 w pracy, w szkole, na uczelni z w\u0142asnymi pogl\u0105dami. \"Nie afiszuj si\u0119, bo komu\u015b to b\u0119dzie przeszkadza\u0107\". To jest takie miasto, z kt\u00f3rego raczej si\u0119 wyje\u017cd\u017ca do miejsc gdzie oddycha si\u0119 swobodniej i gdzie jest bardziej kolorowo, miasto pomi\u0119dzy du\u017cymi o\u015brodkami. Ludzie cz\u0119sto pytaj\u0105 mnie po co w og\u00f3le tu wr\u00f3ci\u0142am. No w\u0142a\u015bnie, po co? Mocno przyklei\u0142o mnie do mojego miasta poczucie misji dziejowej. No bo kto b\u0119dzie tu dzia\u0142a\u0107 na rzecz zmian, je\u015bli wszyscy wyjad\u0105? No, ale r\u00f3\u017cnie te\u017c jest z tym moim podej\u015bciem do zaanga\u017cowania spo\u0142ecznego. Trac\u0119 troch\u0119 energi\u0119. Lata lec\u0105, nie sam\u0105 misj\u0105 cz\u0142owiek przecie\u017c \u017cyje. ZUS wyliczy\u0142 mi emerytur\u0119 przy obecnych zarobkach na kwot\u0119 145,16 pln. Zabawne, nie? \n\nJak my\u015bl\u0119 o tym, sk\u0105d mi si\u0119 wzi\u0119\u0142a ta ch\u0119\u0107 walki z wiatrakami to z pewno\u015bci\u0105 wa\u017cnym etapem dla mnie by\u0142y studia w Krakowie, w kt\u00f3rym tak wiele si\u0119 dzia\u0142o i nadal si\u0119 dzieje. Ju\u017c w liceum by\u0142am w klimatach punkowych i te idea\u0142y, kt\u00f3rymi wtedy nasi\u0105k\u0142am zacz\u0119\u0142y we mnie pracowa\u0107. Wierzy\u0142am, \u017ce trzeba dzia\u0142a\u0107 ju\u017c teraz, nie czeka\u0107, zmienia\u0107 \u015bwiat, organizowa\u0107 si\u0119. Szuka\u0142am swoich miejsc i ludzi. Chodzi\u0142am do klub\u00f3w, na koncerty, na spotkania dyskusyjne. W same studia mo\u017ce nie by\u0142am wkr\u0119cona, ale w r\u00f3\u017cne dzia\u0142ania obywatelskie i w ruchy oddolne na maksa. Wiele si\u0119 tam nauczy\u0142am i po powrocie do rodzinnego miasta chcia\u0142am robi\u0107 to dalej. \n\nCzego bym potrzebowa\u0142a, \u017ceby si\u0119 nie podda\u0107? Wsparcia, szczeg\u00f3lnie psychologicznego. Uczestniczy\u0142am w Marszu R\u00f3wno\u015bci i tu\u017c przed mia\u0142am taki spadek energii i wiary w sens wszystkiego co robi\u0119, \u017ce my\u015bla\u0142am, \u017ce ju\u017c nie dam rady. Nie jestem radyka\u0142em, ale niekt\u00f3rzy tak mnie widz\u0105. W ko\u0144cu \u017cyj\u0119 z kobiet\u0105 w zwi\u0105zku. Dla wielu ju\u017c to jest radykalne. Naczyta\u0142am si\u0119 mn\u00f3stwo hejterskich komentarzy, w tym tych z \u017cyczeniem nam wszystkim \u015bmierci, z wyzwiskami i gro\u017abami...i mimo to, pr\u00f3bowa\u0142am tym ludziom na spokojnie t\u0142umaczy\u0107 w\u0142asn\u0105 perspektyw\u0119. W efekcie za du\u017co przyj\u0119\u0142am na siebie i zacz\u0119\u0142am traci\u0107 r\u00f3wnowag\u0119 psychiczn\u0105. Jak cho\u0107by takie komentarze, \u017ce mo\u017ce co\u015b w moim \u017cyciu posz\u0142o nie tak, \u017ce to nie spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo ma problem tylko ja sama. \u017be mo\u017ce jestem chora, zaburzona, zboczona. W chwili najwi\u0119kszej s\u0142abo\u015bci zacz\u0119\u0142am nawet my\u015ble\u0107, \u017ce mo\u017ce oni wszyscy maj\u0105 racj\u0119? \u017be mo\u017ce bycie osob\u0105 niehetero to problem natury psychologicznej? Totalnie mnie to wszystko rozchwia\u0142o, mia\u0142am ataki paniki i musia\u0142am si\u0119 na chwil\u0119 wycofa\u0107, bo zacz\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 to dla mnie robi\u0107 bardzo niebezpieczne. My\u015bl\u0119 jednak, \u017ce to co czu\u0142am nie jest wcale takie nietypowe. Brak wsparcia, chroniczne przem\u0119czenie psychiczne i osamotnienie w dzia\u0142aniach to chyba typowe w \u015brodowisku aktywist\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rzy poruszaj\u0105 trudne tematy spo\u0142eczne. \n\nCzasem chcia\u0142abym us\u0142ysze\u0107, \u017ce to jest wa\u017cne spo\u0142ecznie. \u017be to nie tylko temat, kt\u00f3ry przyniesie zam\u0119t i b\u0119dzie robi\u0107 nam wszystkim problemy, ale \u017ce to jest wa\u017cne. Za ma\u0142o mam bod\u017ac\u00f3w wspieraj\u0105cych. Bardzo mi tego brakuje, \u017ceby moi bliscy poklepali mnie czasem i do\u0142adowali energetycznie. Osamotnienie i niemoc s\u0105 najgorsze. Takie poczucie, \u017ce wsz\u0119dzie wok\u00f3\u0142 s\u0105 \u015bciany od kt\u00f3rych ci\u0105gle musisz si\u0119 odbija\u0107. Negatywne bod\u017ace odbieraj\u0105 satysfakcj\u0119 a bycie w ci\u0105g\u0142ej gotowo\u015bci do mierzenia si\u0119 z trudno\u015bciami utrudnia te\u017c zobaczenie tego co ju\u017c si\u0119 uda\u0142o, ilu osobom uda\u0142o si\u0119 pokaza\u0107, \u017ce bycie osob\u0105 z grupy mniejszo\u015bciowej wcale nie musi by\u0107 przera\u017caj\u0105ce i z\u0142e. \n\nMarzenia?

As a linguistic anthropologist working with newly arrived migrants and refugees in Germany, I have heard a lot from my informants about the ways in which their internet use and needs have changed since leaving their countries of origin. \nMany struggled to find sufficient wifi connectivity en route in order to e.g. access navigation apps and services, stay in contact with friends and family members and contact emergency services. Others reported that they did not have sufficient access to legal information (particularly in their first language). Many rely heavily on translation apps which are often not adequate or do not translate from/into their first language. \n\nThese are just a few examples of internet-based issues facing current migrants and refugees. What can be done to improve internet-based services, platforms, apps, access to advocacy groups and activists and support forums?  How can we think about the private/public divide in this context: how do we ensure quick access, user anonymity and safe networks? What are the responsibilities of content providers? How can individuals ensure that their data is protected?\n\nWhat is currently being done to make internet-based services better for migrants and refugees and what needs to be done?", "created_at": "2019-08-07 03:01:09.863556", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 12:56:47.427428", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 214, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 167.8, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4096, 5, 4739, 5268, 4934, 1856, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62731, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10489, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Another good resource is the repository of edgeryders community members work on this topic - https://edgeryders.eu/c/knowledge/migration", "created_at": "2019-11-01 09:34:54.951286", "updated_at": "2019-11-01 09:34:54.951286", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5059], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57736, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10509, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*These weekly calls are where the Edgeryders communication crew coordinates the work of supporting project teams, community managers, fellows and community members to get the word out and engage people in the exciting work everyone is doing.*\n\nThey happen Tuesdays at 16.30 CET on ZOOM here: https://zoom.us/j/306882359\n\n**This call will focus on:**\n\n* **Edgeryders Festival**\n* **Gathering input on what is happening in the different projects**  and what content should be promoted in the next  **weeks**: POPREBEL and NGI and OTHERS\n* **Building a unified campaign to highlight our Climate work**  and draw participation in the different activities and platform conversations (Deep Green/EarthOS) needs @ilaria\u2019s input - but she's on a holiday\n* **Making visible what people can get out of participating**  to the conversations and activities hosted on this platform.\n\n**Project Update 1/2:**\n\n## POPREBEL\n\n**Please prepare to describe updates &amp; share urls to platform content you especially like/want pushed out:**  @alberto @marina @noemi @nadia @natalia_skoczylas @Jan@amelia@matthias @natalia_skoczylas @Jirka_Kocian @Richard\n\n**1.

From when i was 17, for almost 13 years I\u2019m creating or organizing lots of different organisations, communities, projects &amp; even a company: An event bureau that became an art collective, an online cultural magazine, an opensource hardware project for cargo bikes, a temporary community space, a folkloric group, a tool library, a fermentation shop ,\u2026 Every time it was / is a passion project but every time it failed to become long term sustainable like i wanted. \n\nWhile in the beginning it was more my anarchistic tendency to not want to work for the system, earn like the system, later it was more a difficulty to scale up, or to make it \u201ceconomically viable\u201d, or that it was legally not possible... There is still in me that part that doesn\u2019t want to conform to a classic way of thinking, but at the same time there is that frustration of not wanting to be marginalized through the projects i\u2019m setting up. \n\nLots of same like organizations that do great communal work have that problem like private but community based Fab Labs, organizers of temporary space occupation, art collectives,\u2026 I find it unfair that while doing impact-full work, the monetisation doesn\u2019t follow. And when you conform to an economical viable plan, you loose the human centered project. So where do community based projects need to place themselves to be able to professionalize but not loose their values out of sight? That was the big itch that was scratching\u2026\n\nBut then came a really insightful discussion with a friend and fablab manager who was struggling with the same questions. He started describing the principle of the long tail (90\u20139 -1) but was adding a second level of community involvement. What he was describing was what i was also searching to create in each of the project: inspire people to care about a certain topic, create vocations and give them a space to thrive while building up a certain income to make it viable for all people involved. When making a scheme of it it looked a bit like this:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fn_t2iAVMX4kCCHoiB_1tQ.png)\n\nI\u2019m not pretending to re-invent the wheel here, but this suits my needs on how i construct projects, it\u2019s a \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d. So how does it work: looking at it horizontally you have three levels of possible income: \n\n* **Community:** this can be in the form of a monthly fee, usage of the space. It mostly can cover some of the cost but isn\u2019t the most profitable on its own\n* **Workshops:** We\u2019re in the age of knowledge, and sharing the knowledge is somethings searched for. This creates opportunities for members of the community and has a good profit margin, \n* **Jobs:** these are classical economical transactions where a job is demanded and an income is received. It\u2019s the most straight forward, but not the easiest to create from the start for community based projects.\n\nOn the vertical level we can define the different types of users.\n\n* **Client / Professional:** These are the most far apart because the main transaction is one of money. They have a practical relation based on mutual needs.\n* **Participant / Tutor:** Not only is there a monetary exchange, but also one of knowledge. Both get a bit closer to each other because of this double transaction\n* **Member:** Finally there is the member of the community that is at the same time creator as a user and becomes therefor one. It\u2019s the core of what makes a community based economical project.\n\nThe only thing missing is creating a motion for the user. Being able to start at any stage of the project and climbing up from client to professional. It\u2019s an extra long tail, and we\u2019re not inspiring to transform every client into a professional, but **being able to build that road for many to try to walk is at its core the essence of what i thrive to create in any of my projects.** \n\nI see in this model a possible explanation of what i want to build: a space where people can enjoy their passion on different levels with the possibility to grow but also just act as the user they want or intent to be. It will not fit every kind of project, some will prefer straightforward job / client privileges, but with project looking into re-inventing the way we produce and consume in an urban environment like tool libraries, fablabs, foodlabs, bike bars, city agriculture, construction projects\u2026 it could maybe interesting to look further into this community based economics. \n\nI will for sure dive deeper in the possibility to make this sustainable, and to look at the factors that are needed to succeed in the establishment of such hybrid non/for profit company/organisation/cooperative.", "created_at": "2019-08-09 08:23:09.981739", "updated_at": "2019-08-13 12:34:49.361931", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 848, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 1410.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5, 3067, 4, 4795, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57878, "user_id": 4288, "topic_id": 10523, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@alberto @noemi  One more **urgent question**.

During several preparatory meetings an international group of initiators were established (including representatives of the OECD, Eurocities, the German Government, the *Land* Berlin, the Danish Design Center, the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, the Regulatory Control Council (NKR), Nesta (UK), the European Cultural Foundation, the Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Potsdam, Viadrina, Fraunhofer, Bertelsmann Foundation, Robert Bosch Foundation, Future Berlin Foundation, Telekom Foundation, Zeit Foundation, Politics for Tomorrow). This group is open to admit additional partners.\n\nThe 2018 edition of the Creative Bureaucracy Festival attracted 1200 participants from public bodies at national, regional, municipal and international levels from 21 countries, featured 165 speakers, and included topics varying from sustainability, IT and digitalisation, labour and employment, leadership and management, urban transformation and development to culture, security, education, healthcare, justice and legislation, with over 100 hours of programme taking place on 9 different stages. Many young talent participants (under the age of 30) were attracted, and events included workshops, discussions, awards, parties, and a very popular &quot;Fuck Up Night' (featuring personal testimonials about the biggest bureaucratic 'fuckups'. The Berlin event has inspired other cities to organise similar festivals, and these are now being planned in `Brussels, Bergen, Amsterdam, Adelaide and Athens.\n\n**Goal of the 2019 Festival:** Increase innovations in the Public Sector; recognition and exchange of innovators; recruitment of performance-oriented, innovative young talents; improvement of the public perception of the Public Sector and its innovative strength.\n\n**Target Group for the 2019 Festival:** Innovators from the Public Sector on all levels; young talents; the interested public and the media; institutions which support innovations in the Public Sector (such as private foundations) and companies; citizens who are committing themselves in NGOs or as individuals in the design of the Public Sector: this is also expressed by the motto of the Festival: \u201cYou work for the common good.

The use of -cene, meaning a geological epoch, is wrong, according to the time of the Earth, not talking of the galaxy or even universe. It's arrogant, like the concept it expresses. Maybe we should use a different word, do we have viable options?  \n\nThe problem I see here, in the article, is confusing the wrong use of the term, which presumes that a span of - let's say - 200 years could be considered un epoch and maybe it shouldn't be seen not even as an event **in geology**, with the use of it in **human sciences**, especially in media and communications, to highlight the impact of our actions on the climate and the ecosystems. \n\nAs George Carlin said, \"the planet is fine, the people are fucked\". Of course what we do wouldn't touch the surface of the Earth on a geological scale, but it concerns us as a species: the conditions we are living, and more coming in the future, are the results of our arrogance. Playing to be omnipotent brought us to an uncertain environment, unpredictable climate and, in the end, to a threat to ourselves. Moreover, people living in poorer countries will suffer more. \n\nSo I think that, even if Anthropocene is not the proper term to classify a geological epoch, I think it's a useful term to become more conscious of our actions and, maybe, change our behaviour (for ourselves, not for the planet).", "created_at": "2019-08-27 13:57:57.567096", "updated_at": "2019-08-27 13:57:57.567096", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 250, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58084, "user_id": 3947, "topic_id": 10568, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![infosesion_ourghema%20(2)|690x516](upload://17yUmbggLcuFmM05B74vzXtlHpX.jpeg)\n<br>\nDuring this week, we have organized our first info session to present OCI Lab initiative to aspiring social entrepreneurs and skilled people in Medenine. The session took place at OurGhema coworking space. Actually, we have chosen OurGhema as a starting point for our series of info sessions for two reasons:\n\n* OurGhema is a symbolic place for Edgeryders. It was almost the place where Edgeryders has started its activities in the MENA region. Edgeryders cofounders, and many community members have already visited the place, and are enthusiastic about building something in this region. \n\n* OurGhema community are quite familiar with Edgeryders and the work is doing. To have our info session there aimed also at collecting feedback on our vision, our program and offers, how to conduct the info session and how to enhance our message. We needed these insights before going to new spaces and partners in Tunisia and in the MENA region. \n\n9 participants have attended the info session, including 5 who wish to apply as project leaders, 2 as contributors and the other were just curious. \n\nBellow are the main feedback we have collected: \n\n* All participants asked to showcase different projects which were supported by the Edgeryders community. Lucky us that @Yosser  was present, and she shared her experience and the different events she has organized starting from the platform and the community calls. \n\n* A participant asked if he can apply, as he is only 16 years old. He has a coding club that is teaching kids in rural schools how to code. We have encouraged him to apply. \n\n*  Other participant, who is studying at a medical school with a specialty in psychology, suggested that she could join the coding club and offer psychological assistance to their programs.   \n\n* A member of the board committee of Alinov Tunisia, @Nidhal  was present during the info session. He suggested that we could collaborate in the future. Actually, they are launching next year different programs to support social entrepreneurs in North Africa, and eventually in Sub-Saharan Africa, including boot camps, incubation and acceleration programs. He was interested in benefiting from the Edgeryders platform and OCI Lab program to offer mentoring to their future beneficiaries. \n\n* Most participants were quite interested about assisting the Open Village Festivals for inspiration, networking and meeting their peers and mentors from around the world. I believe, since I have attended the Open Village Festival, I have been able to share my experience and enthusiasm, which made participants quite interested in participating. \n\n* Some modification will be made on the website according the feedback and the discussions with the participants. \n\nOther partners that I have spoken to, are getting curious and interested in learning more about OCI Lab and Edgeryders. We will be meeting them during next week to discuss further areas of collaboration. We will be also organizing other info sessions to bring aspired social entrepreneurs to the OCI Labs and to the platform. \n\n![infosesion_ourghema%20(1)|690x516](upload://sd2o875ivrkcYYFJ9Vtn97BTTLC.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-08-17 16:34:40.191932", "updated_at": "2019-12-17 11:23:10.721673", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 500, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 157.8, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3703, 3942, 3782, 3, 4022, 3812, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58088, "user_id": 3942, "topic_id": 10568, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thank you @Sohayeb for bringing such an opportunity, I'm planning to apply for the program as a project leader.

And nothing works (mobile phones, landline phones, electricity all go down.)\n\nindividual agency was key at the start:\n\n* people put on a warning vest, and starting directing traffic at the crossing at the end of their street, to ensure emergency traffic came through.\n* fire brigades from as far as 100km simply started driving towards the scene when they saw the smoke rising and didn't wait for central alerts being sent.\n* people didn't wait for an ambulance but put wounded in a car and drove to hospitals etc.\n* When regional radio announced the location of some medical triage points, we went out into the street where confused and dazed people were coming out of the center of the disaster zone, and guided them towards the nearest triage point / nest for the wounded.\n* People brought water, made coffee and food for first responders and impromptu canteens were set-up at the edge of the affected area by those living near it.\n* Pubs / restaurants / cafes opened up their doors for everyone needing shelter / a place to rest etc.\n\nThen, after some hours, local radio became more important with providing info on the situation, advice from local government etc. This led to more organised action. Sports facilities opened up where you could bring bedding materials, red cross stepped in etc.\n\nOver the days a new sort of order and routine emerged, built from those individual and community solidarity based starts. These were not replaced or countermanded by the official response, but taken as a base for further actions by the official response. So are a cities response systems geared towards recognising and leveraging community responses?\n\nThat in contrast was what was so extremely shocking to me with what I saw from the official response after Katrina in the US in 2005, where those individual assistance initiatives were actively hindered / forbidden, and people had to wait for official help that took days and days to appear. That was handled like a law enforcement operation first (hunting 'looters') rather than an emergency aid situation.", "created_at": "2019-09-17 14:43:23.141879", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 14:48:06.909003", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 397, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 31.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59490, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10755, "post_number": 19, "raw": "What we have here in California are huge fires.  The lack of fallback/resilience measures here are causing people to rethink much of their core lives.\n\nAlso, tsunamis.  We have a siren warning system on this north coast of California, and it did go off back when the earthquake hit that destroyed Fukushima.  But a tsunami often is not like a movie portrays it.  Rather, it is like a fast and very high tidal surge.  It came into the harbor in a nearby town here and rather quietly lifted a bunch of fishing and cruising boats off of their pier moorings and set them adrift.  Just tore the ropes right off the docks.  And it came later than the sirens suggested, so for a long time it looked like the sirens gave a false alarm. People went back to their activities and then, whoops, this pier is getting lifted.  The only fallback for something like that was to get the hell out of there and stay out for longer than you thought you should.\n\nI know this is some digression from the main thrust of Peter's inquiry.  But when I think of a lot of Smart City stuff, I think of cameras all over the place.  When they break down, I will probably hope there isn't a fallback mechanism.  Unless there is some greater public good to all those cameras.  In London, it's security.  But do they really deter?  I'm sure the argument is that they do deter. They didn't stop the subway getting blown up in the previous decade. But now there are exponentially more cameras in London.  Do they prevent crime?

While the first has some direct and appreciated practical consequences for the owner of the washing machine, namely a lower electricity bill, the person buying the fairtrade banana only gets to feel like they are doing the right thing. \n\nI would argue that an NGI Trustmark will be more like the sticker on the banana than the sticker on the washing machine. It is true that leaked personal data due to lax cybersecurity, or sold personal data due to lax ethics, may have an individual impact, but this is really a fringe phenomenon. A vast majority of people who get their data leaked or sold are only a single datapoint in hundreds of thousands of others, and will usually suffer no consequences as a result. There are exceptions \u2013 people who for one reason or another are more likely to be harassed or targeted are also harmed more than others by leaks \u2013 but this almost per definition a minority. Instead, the consequences of leaked or sold data are usually societal and structural \u2013 lex Cambridge Analytica, and in that real security becomes an elite privilege. \n\nThis is this relevant because I think it might be wise to not try to make this sticker into something that focuses on what the consumer is getting from the product because I think most consumers will just keep making the long term privacy trade-off for the short term price tag. This is also relevant for design and branding, as the strategy pursued to get people to care about a fair-trade sticker is probably very different from a campaign promoting energy efficiency certification.", "created_at": "2019-09-26 07:50:13.341830", "updated_at": "2019-09-26 07:50:13.341830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59966, "user_id": 3947, "topic_id": 10884, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@nadia @zmorda @alberto @matthias @owen", "created_at": "2019-09-26 12:14:19.936941", "updated_at": "2019-09-26 12:54:21.171149", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60081, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 10886, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"anon87623122, post:5, topic:10886\"]\nMla\u0111e generacije jednostavno nemaju razvijenu naviku \u010ditanja, a pa\u017enja im je rasuta tako da im sve \u0161to je du\u017ee od objave na Facebook-u (nekoliko redova) predstavlja zamor (time se odli\u010dno pozabavio Nikolas Kar u knjizi \u201cPlitko\u201d)\n[/quote]\nPa da, sad je pitanje da li pravimo proizvode koje ljudi traze jer su mladje generacije takve ili se ljudi mijenjaju zbog proizvoda/alatki koje su naviknuti da koriste a koji mozda zaglupljuju ljude? :slight_smile: Idiocracy je bas odlican film na tu temu :slight_smile: \n\nSvidja mi se ideja koristenja savremene tehnologije, zvuci prakticno i izvodivo da mi naucimo vjestacku inteligenciju pravilnom pismu pa da se tako prenosi dalje siroj masi.\nPo trenutnoj metodologiji doduse to nije izvodivo ako se gleda prijevod korisnika i uporedjuje sa drugim korisnicima.

Kuba demonstrated how edgeryders works showing the website. They are supposed to meet again this Saturday. \nWhat I really like: Kuba prepared a manual for signing up and collaborating on the platform. Way to go! \n\n@zalesjan: he's passionate about the climate movement, so now meeting a lot of people. He approaches them by asking to interview them, but it's a little too personal too soon. But the social dynamics are positive, and there is a platform building movement for climate in the country..\nWhat I really like: that if Jan is well embedded in this community, it should be natural to offer Wellbeing in Europe as an online forum where the movement and how people learn and mobilize can be shared internationally\n\nNatalia: is working with Aska to organise 3 workshops in 1 event: they are now deciding on the exact topics and will post about it.\n\nFrom Serbia: the event is focused on bringing together a mix of entrepreneurial people with interesting content and projects to share, and a group that is less active and has more spare energy to engage in a collective project. \nJasen and Noemi are in the process of recruiting a Serbian community member to help @jasen_lakic with onsite organisation.\n\nMy humble advice to you all: \n* reach out to more people at a higher speed. Allocate more time and thinking how it can work - 10-15hrs a week minimum.\n* for Jan: be a community reporter and start yourself with publishing stories about what is happening. Then invite people you know to come in and respond\n* for Kuba: send people you meet interesting stories for them, it's an easier way to contribute by commenting than contribute by posting a full story.\n* put communications about your event online. While you interview people individually, you also need to do outreach and help people to find you! You alone will not be able to personally meet 40 people, but if those 5 you met already can share the invitation to the event with others, then you have higher chances to reach people who are interested to participate.", "created_at": "2019-10-02 16:58:46.438059", "updated_at": "2019-10-02 16:58:46.438059", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 389, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5211], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60485, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10930, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I don';t understand what you mean, @zalesjan - can you reframe the question? \n\nSince you are so deeply into the environmental movement, and since it touches upon pretty much every single aspect of our human existence, I suggest you produce a few posts that explore the connections with - employability, housing, waste, quality of life, health impact, transportation, justice....

When you live in a rented place in a city, (1) it is almost always a small space with low to zero outdoor space and (2) it is not your own space, so you're not allowed to change anything without asking your profit-minded landlord. I hate everything about that. The city is just not the place for physical freedom, but the good thing about digital nomads is that they can work from anywhere if they have Internet. And \"enough Internet\" is not a major challenge \u2013 even in backcountry Morocco we had enough, as you know \u00ad\u2013 a bit more expensive, but fully enough.\n\nSo what I imagine as my dream space is a large compound (6000 m\u00b2 or more) in a rural area, with no neighbors around. Our place in Morocco was quite nice \u2026 if it would be ours, and if it would be about four times the outdoor area size. With enough space, everyone can do what they want without interfering with each other \u2026 it needs much fewer rules. For example, many small businesses can do their thing in such a space. As another example, it would be heaven for people living in a vehicle (like me) if there would be multiple such spaces to travel between, with parking space and modern comforts and infrastructure at each of them.\n\nMy best examples for this kind of co-living would be [Calafou](https://calafou.org/) and also [Valldaura Labs](https://valldaura.net/). It's certainly not the mainstream of co-living, though.

Participants can volunteer abroad or in their country of residence for projects covering social inclusion, environment, culture, and more.\nVolunteering teams are groups of 10-40 young people from at least two different countries who volunteer together for a period of between 2 weeks and 2 months. The costs of accommodation and food are covered. Participants also receive a small allowance for personal expenses.\n \nTRAINEESHIPS AND JOBS\nTraineeships count as full-time work practice and last between 2 and 6 months \u2013 renewable once. They are paid for by the organisation responsible for the traineeship. Trainees develop their personal, educational, social, civic and professional skills.\nJobs are full-time and last between 3 and 12 months. They are paid for by the organisation employing the participant.\nTraineeships and jobs can take place in the participant\u2019s country of residence or abroad. If abroad, participants receive a small allowance to help them relocate and settle in a foreign country.\nParticipants of volunteering activities, traineeships and jobs get online linguistic support, training and mentoring. Their travel costs to and from the project venue are covered.\n\nSOLIDARITY PROJECTS\nSolidarity projects are initiated, developed and implemented over a period of 2 to 12 months by at least five young people who want to make a positive change in their local community. Young people who want to run a solidarity project in their country of residence must register in the European Solidarity Corps portal.\n\nYou can find some examples here: https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity/solidarity_projects_en\n\nI report here one of them:\n#### Paranduskohvik \u2013 a repair caf\u00e9 in Estonia\nThe main purpose for the repair caf\u00e9 is to make people aware of the negative environmental impacts of the consumer society and to encourage them to maintain the environment.

Make sure the relevant content is tagged for harvesting\n\nGraphryder collects data on the basis of a (Discourse) tag identifying the project. By convention, these tags always start in `ethno-`. For NGI Forward, for example, it is `ethno-ngi-forward`. \n\nTo make sure you have the right collection of topics, you need to tag each topic with the project's tag. Most projects in Edgeryders have their own cats: for NGI Forward, the cat is #ioh. Occasionally community managers and ethnographer assign an `ethno-` tag to some content that lives elsewhere (for example in past projects), but normally every top in the project cat is part of that project's ethnographic corpus. This means, every top in the project cat needs to be tagged with the project's tag *as well*.  \n\nTo do this: \n\n* Go through all public sub-categories plus the `/none` sub cat (example `https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/none`. \n* For each of these sub-cats, scroll down until the end of its topic lists \n* Next, go back to the top and click on the `Topics` button to the left:\n![image|374x140](upload://8WuzAlmM9swkI3Qrx99G5Q8fQqG.png) \n* Click on the  `Select all` button. A wrench icon appears on the right. Click it.\n* Click `Append tag`, then select or type the `ethno-` tag as appropriate.\nSelect all topics and append the tag `ethno-ngi-forward`\n\n### 2.

Our approach has the added benefit of building consensus around a shared mission, and unlocking multilateral collaborations. \n\nWe have developed and tested our methods and technologies through our work  with top universities in europe, local administrations and organisations such as the World Bank, UNDP and Rockefeller Foundation. Right now our work is based in Belgium because we think that is it the perfect place to build these new approaches because of the diversity: it is a perfect microcosm of the diverse range of needs that our solutions have to meet in order to be viable and replicable elsewhere. \n\n## Mention Notable successes: \n\n   * Has influenced the design of the new Belgian Strategy for International Development and Cooperation.\n   * Mentioned by Italian Daily La Repubblica as having played a role in the Economic growth of the Italian City of Matera, \n   * Has been involved in the successful bids for European Capital of Culture of the cities of Matera and Galway \n\n**DO Name drop:** \n\nNotable members include Robin Chase, Founder of Zipcar, Amelia Andersdotter former MEP for the Swedish Pirate Party and Digital Rights activist, Fabrizio Barca - Ex General Director of division chief at the research department of the Bank of Italy and  chief of the department of development and cohesion policies at the treasury with previous tenures as chief at the research department of the Bank of Italy,and the president of the OECD\u2019s territorial policies committee.\n\n## Make sure the journalist includes the link to the Eventbrite page: NOT the indiegogo: \nhttp://bit.ly/SciFiEconBillets\n\n________________________________", "created_at": "2019-11-07 14:06:44.870307", "updated_at": "2019-11-07 14:06:44.870307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 404, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 47.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 2567], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63330, "user_id": 5583, "topic_id": 11398, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Ahoj, celosv\u011btov\u00e1 sb\u00edrka - hust\u00fd!

Or just from Mic, if you routed the mobile phone to \"Mic\" in step 1.\n\n    * **Sound levels.** Speak in a loud voice into the headset, and have somebody call on the mobile phone and speak with a loud voice. Record that and make sure the waveform does not hit the top while doing that. If it does (\"clipping\"), adjust the input volume down. If volume is too low, adjust up.\n\n    * **Monitor output.** There should be a setting to allow you hearing the \"Line In\" or \"Mic\" input at the same time as recording it, on your headset.

The session will be a workshop about verbal and non-verbal communication and public speaking skills with practical activities in order to make youth know their abilities to speak in public and give them feedback about what they need to improve to make the perfect pitch.\n\n**_Trainer:_** Amine REKHIS\n\n_**Venue:**_ Hive 12 Coworking Space\n\n**Fourth Darja: Sales and marketing: Negotiate like a pro!**\n\n**_Topic:_** The purpose of the training is to make young people between 16 and 20 years old familiar with entrepreneurial basics. The point is to facilitate those theories and present them in a funny and smooth way to make them attracted to the field. For this reason, we will make sure that they prepare homemade products and to teach them how to sell them to their classmates and school teachers.\n\n**_Date of the event:_**  Not defined\n\n**_Duration:_** 4 to 6 hours\n\n**_Content of the training:_** To be an excellent salesperson, one has to master the ability to listen to his or her customers. They will be taught how to express their thoughts crisply and clearly instead of just blabbering whatever comes in their mind. Great salesperson&rsquo;s assets include a thorough and convincing speech.\n\nIn addition to that, no successful salesperson simply stayed at the back of the room, cowering, and just blending in the background. Salespersons talk to people, especially to potential customers. As such, they need to have self-confidence. It is an important trait for both kids and adults. So this evening will be oriented to encourage high school teens on whatever they like to do. That will help them believe in themselves and foster their self-confidence.\n\nAnd to come to the most important point, success in sales comes as a by-product of providing customers what they need, something of value to them. Everyone likes people who bring value to their lives and not just those who just want to sell and earn money. We will Teach those teens the value of giving value to customers first. After all, the repeat customers make a salesperson even more successful.\n\n**_Trainer:_** Youssef JOUDI\n\n_**Venue:**_ Hive 12 Coworking Space\n\n**Fifth Darja: Fundraising: Take it to the next level!**\n\n_**Topic:**_\n\nThe training will be engaging with a range of learning opportunities.

So I'm moving there for ease of access, easier parking and the synergies with other projects.\n\nI was doing the clinic during the day, but a lot of people had problems getting childcare or said they could not come because of their working hours, so I am thinking I will run it from the afternoon into the evening instead, to give people a chance to come along who otherwise couldn't.

Most of it is just lying in the sun. No judgement necessary.\n\nTwo: doing nothing is very rebelious these days. Why think of myself as a lazy-ass when I can think of myself as bad-ass?\n\nOn the question of how to\u00a0help people to cope with expectations they can't and don't want to meet - \u00a0I think it's something we each do for ourselves.

I recommend you use non-toxic pigment (and still use masks - just to spread awareness), and there are a bunch of non-toxic to fairly harmless liquids to mix stuff into (e.g linseed oil*). You can get a lot done with mortar and pestle for personalization scale.\n\nOther things that help are fabrics with nice haptic properties (you can sew together patch-work style). Needle skills are nice to have anyway if you want/have to live low budget. Just make sure you get good thread. Fabric will also improve overall acoustics.\n\nPull broken head-phones out of the trash and fix them (9/10 are broken at the jack, you can fix them with almost nothing, if you are good you can re-use the solder that is already on them. Then you only need a lighter/candle and e.g. some liquid adhesive and string to fix things permanently. A quiet atmosphere and my (home) sounds around me help my mood a lot.\n\nLEDs are another option for color personalization instead of paint. If you DIY, just make sure you understand what resistor you need. You will need one unless you do plug in LED-bands which are relatively expensive (but still not bad, you could also cannibalize them). If treated right LEDs will last forever though.\n\n*Not sure how well that works on particle board though. Epoxy is the solution that will always work (and can also be used to fix a lot of other stuff) but is potentially somewhat toxic, moderately expensive (if you buy a big just past shelf life bucket), and needs some know-how and tools to avoid a utter uncleanable mess.

I think it'd be best to discuss them in detail starting from the most fundamental question, namely:\n\n<strong>What are we raising money for?</strong>\n\nAlberto, I understand and agree with your argument that Edgeryders themselves are much stronger and well-embeded than SC4SV. However, I would still argue for SC4SV as the \"purpose\" of the cf campaign. Here are my two main reasons:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Tangibility of campaign's goal. Creating a \"fund\" may be a much more \"tangible\" and \"measurable\" outcome than \"managing/growing/supporting\u00a0an existing community\" for someone who is new to Edgeryders (potential backers). In other words,\u00a0would you rather support a project through which an organization/community tries to crowdfund its development (what exactly do we mean by that?) or a project to develop one of its products (particularly if you're interested in using the product later on)? We need to keep in mind the standpoint of potential backers.</li>\n\n<li><span>I don't think it is an \"either-or\" argument. We would not be raising money <strong>as</strong> SC4SV. We'd be raising money <strong>as Edgeryders</strong> for a project, which is SC4SV. From this standpoint, all your arguments about the power and potential of ER as a community remain relevant and still support the cause.\u00a0</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI realize that this is where\u00a0we come back to what you wrote about the (un)willingness of potential sponsors/backers to fund organizations in the first place... But I'm affraid we might\u00a0<span>throw the baby out with the bathwater by focusing too much on this argument.</span>\n\nSo\u00a0I guess the <strong>bottom line for us</strong> is - if we decide to crowdfund Edgeryders as a whole and not SC4SV, are we <span>then\u00a0</span>able to list things we are raising money for, specify the outcomes/goals and draw a\u00a0timeframe for it? The goal of the campaign should be as clear and \"measurable\" (and \"attractive\")\u00a0as possible.\u00a0\n\nOnce we answer these questions, we can move to the issue of platform type (donation/reward/equity/lending) and then communication (videos, message, channels, etc.).\n\n<span>What do you think?</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-24 19:56:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.132198", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21249, "user_id": 84, "topic_id": 1026, "post_number": 4, "raw": "the 8-8-8 concept is interesting, i found working on phsyical tasks like cooking, cleaning, gardening and building 4 hours straight is not a problem, 4 hours first half day, 4 hours second half. but for more cognitive work, or learning even, concentration span is more like an hour, a review, an hour a break etc. if people were working separatley but together time for quick peer review or 'unloading' might be helpful.\n\nnot sure alberto, think your idea is good about everybody splitting their day into chores, work, socialise etc. half of me thinks this is just healthy and even if people arnt good at the practical stuff they should just do it anyway (washing, chores, cooking) and if others are not confident in working on other projects they should be encouraged to give the same amount of time a day to it as everyone else, thereby building confidence. so many things cannot be predicted, i know if time is allocated to projects stuff does get done.\n\nbut could there be an issue of mis matching skills to work? i dont think it would do any harm to put everybody in the same boat, but also where people have particular talents or drive, should it be homogenised? some people are brilliant but frustrated by simple tasks, if there is a community then there are options open, do they\u00a0all learn to work the same, or do they\u00a0have different roles? \u00a0those are not really direct questions, there are so many possibilities, i imagine some of these things can only be ironed out in the prensence of the project.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-06 12:36:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.136792", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 279, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22409, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1029, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Cross my heart and hope to die...</b>\n\nI promise, Alberto, to prepare special presentation for non-Greeks.

When the Transeuropa Network I'm involved in went from being a membership-based\u00a0network supported by core staff from European Alternatives to becoming a cooperative, we looked to systematise particular collaborative behaviours that had worked between particular groups (cooperative being formed of 15 city groups ax Europe). This works on different levels - amongst which developing projects together, getting the resources to do them together and involving others in projects. On getting resources, a few members may want to develop a project where they have some skills and they want others - like filming, design or research. They can identify through the network who has the skills and then bring them onto the project. They can then identify people in the network who can help them with getting funding - some are better are getting grant funding, others more at fundraising, etc. A portion of the funding of the project is re-invested in\u00a0building the network (in fact the majority of our fundraising is to invest in the network), (which is also complemented by members donations), which can either be to help projects who haven't been able to get funding or to help local groups/members work on transnational projects. In the space of two years doing this, Members have leveraged almost a third of the fundraising of the cooperative, with the skills learnt to raise funds, reputation of partners they've worked with and even opportunities for members to make part of their\u00a0living through this (not the intention, but a nice by product!).\n\nAside from the particularities or eccentricities of this approach, I wonder if there's something needed for Edgeryders on how Projects re-invest resources (financial or non-financial, whichever works for them) into Edgeryders and how the Member can help Edgeryders to develop itself as a Network and where possible, provide advice from its own skills to Projects where it is possible and desirable for the Member to do so?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-28 21:03:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.314597", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 462, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22871, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1092, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>economy, ideas, experiments</b>\n\nThe spreadsheet I wrote was just an old idea of how to simulate a self-propelled pyramid with just 3 generations of women (girls, moms, grannies). The one you suggest would have more details - which we'd have to grab from somewhere.\n\nNow, this spreadsheet would serve as a starting point for conversations. What's also needed is a way to grow, run and evaluate ideas. For example, there's the notion that waiting lists are better handled in a centralised way (at the hospital, not by surgeons), and of course not all agree (a number of surgeons would like to set their own priorities). Could it be that it needs to be tested? Same with ideas for reducing not-clearly-needed surgery (getting the surgeon together with the general practitioner who possibly knows the patient better, and maybe a non-surgical specialty) would be costly but maybe it would reduce indications, paying for itself (but there would have to be a way to check that it's not just a way to reduce costs, but also to increase good results). Maybe it would work, and maybe what's needed is a framework for honest (= open) experimenting - if it doesn't exist already.\n\nI'm not an expert in any of this.

And those who don't have the time to earn credits first can also spend money, which would be the way this translation portal can keep itself afloat. Seems like a nice little startup idea. And maybe an unMonastery interface project? Just wild thinking though ...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-14 21:05:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.619635", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 196, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26190], "is_liked_by": [81], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27014, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1103, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Mind the gap (and solve by interface)</b>\n\nActually we now do have an official unMonastery interface living in Matera: Andrea Paoletti, also in Edgeryders 1.\u00a0\n\nAnd that's a good thing, because it seems that people are sort of growing into the idea that unMonasterians could be asked for skilled help. For example, in hydroponic agriculture in the Sassi:\u00a0<a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/content/orti-citt%C3%A0-orti-matera-da-qui-al-2019-e-oltre\">here's a recent mission</a> Ilaria forgot to mention, with a brilliant 12-year old showing off his hydroponic garden. The person who actually wrote the mission is a PhD in Earth Science or something like that. In\u00a0the ensuing discussion (in Italian) I can't help mentioning the unMonastery, and people like Darren or Simone Muffolini. So there is going to be a political choice: the unMonastery will have to choose one or two outreach projects and forego the others. Maintaining a close link pledging unMonasterians =&gt; Ben =&gt; Andrea (and Ilaria, and maybe myself a bit) =&gt; the Matera community is going to be critical to do this well.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-13 18:35:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.451170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 200, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26190], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20767, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-11 17:52:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:25:23.804151", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:15:57.505222", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18392, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-11 17:48:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:24:43.565672", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:15:50.866179", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22617, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-11 18:53:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:25:54.975751", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:16:04.595464", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33402, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-12 17:59:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-21 15:07:10.857694", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:16:27.763205", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11461, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-09 17:44:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:22:46.911501", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:15:26.949809", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25473, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-13 18:01:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:26:42.903566", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:16:24.265752", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19033, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1246, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>La R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et les philosophes</b>\n\nJ'ai effectu\u00e9 une petite enqu\u00eate hier sur Twitter.
