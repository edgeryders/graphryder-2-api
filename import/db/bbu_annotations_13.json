You people have so many stories where you are cheated by evil, and I have watched you cry when your dates left you, I watched you bleed when you come home from fights, etc. I know the world is inherently evil but that's on the world, not society.

They can't really kill you.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                escaping\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                The city\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                family issues\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                Trust\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                Family\n            \n        \n        \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-22 16:28:14.850788", "updated_at": "2020-09-22 16:28:14.850788", "tag_id": 1523, "post_id": 4016, "creator_id": 9, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1248}, {"id": 13336, "text": "", "quote": "Boxes.
