It often is political or artistic in nature, but may present an individual's life stance. Manifestos relating to religious belief are generally referred to as creeds.\n\nSo far I have only added some points from Corita Kent, but will add as I go.

However, I see some possible hurdles, mostly related to money. Talking about money is uncomfortable in our circles, but when running a huge project like Blivande, you can't avoid the subject. My strategy is usually to just lay all the numbers out on the table and make our needs clear.\n\nOur fixed monthly costs are 140.000 SEK. That does not include any salaries for us running the space, but once we break even we also need to start paying ourselves. One important source of income is events. Since the Node rents the space Monday to Thursday night, every other Saturday and every Sunday, we only have one or two nights a week to get event income for Blivande. \n\nWhen we rent the space out for parties, our standard price is 15.000 per night to rent all three rooms. Sometimes we cut deals for friends and community members, or only rent out part of the space, bringing the price down. We have pretty much stopped taking the risk of profit sharing events, and made it clear to organizers that we need to be paid regardless of the profitability of the event. Running events takes physical and mental a toll on our health and wellbeing, as we (almost exclusively @hampus and @Linnea at this point)  have to be in the house all night and usually have to do quite a lot of cleaning, even when the organizers clean there is usually some more work to be done to get the space ready for co-working the following day.\n\nThese ceremonies are different in that we don't need to work as much, and that's good. They also only use a single room, which makes them easier to run. However, since they need peace and quiet it restricts what we can do in the other rooms at the same time. We're still in early days, and we're not fully booked on Fridays, so this might be a way to have a more diverse range of activities happening in the evenings under the Blivande banner. I could envision us doing a trial run once, with a profit-sharing model, to see how it works. This decision lies more with @hampus and @Linnea though, as they are more in charge of the events than I am.\n\nIf we were to run this as a reoccurring event, I think we would need to aim for these events generating 5000 SEK per night for Blivande. I'm not sure what participants are usually charged, but now that you know what our needs and constraints are, perhaps you're able to see if you think it would be possible under these conditions?", "created_at": "2019-08-23 13:50:27.313125", "updated_at": "2019-08-23 13:53:03.216622", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 465, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [1213], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2530, "user_id": 93, "topic_id": 608, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have a lovely old Go game that I never play at home and I am considering to bring to the Beta Lounge.

Maybe we can sit down and spend some time doing that this Friday?\n\n# **On painting containers in general:** \n\n*A general advice I would like to give when it comes to painting container sides is that the corrugation makes it quite different from painting a normal flat canvas (whatever the material). This difference is easy to underestimate, and when it's completely ignored the results are usually such that we end up scrambling to cover up the result with something new. The Skulls & bones painting by the eager art students being the latest example but also Amandus attempt to a certain extent (which he still hasn't even finished yet BTW; masking tape still hanging off it like old band-aids swinging in the wind).* \n\nGiven the differing angles (with a varyingly convex and concave surface) the light hits the side in varying ways. Any image will also morph depending on what angle you are looking at it from. Lines will break and so on. Only from a 0 degree angle will it look like a normal canvas (which of course can be a cool effect if used consciously!). \n\nSorry to be a bit boring by urging some initial caution here but I feel a need to counterbalance Hugi's laissez-faire enthusiasm. The thing is that I myself was the one expressing his exact sentiment when the art students from Gerlesborg asked me the very same question and we've had to live with the consequences since. Again let's talk about it on Friday in person. :slight_smile:  \n\n[quote=\"DianaMO, post:7, topic:1168, full:true\"]\nWhat about the white rather ugly side of the blue BL container?

It's important to note that even though we call it a \"residency\", nobody lives at House Blivande.\n\n## How much do artists in residence pay?\n\nArtists in residence with rooms have Studio Beta fixed desk memberships and pay 3900 SEK per month + VAT, but instead of having a desk on the second floor, they are given their own room at Studio Tau. Artists in residence with desks have Studio Beta flex desk memberships and pay 2500 SEK per month + VAT. Both have access to the flex desks at Beta, along with their fixed places at Tau.\n\n## How does one get selected to be an artist in residence?\nCurrently, the Blivande board ultimately decides who gets offered the opportunity to be an artist in residence since we sign the contract. However, we want this to be a conversation within the community, where people are asked to introduce themselves to the forum first and tell us about their art and plans. Since we've only had to do this twice, our selection criteria are evolving. So far, we have been looking for people who fulfill the following criteria:\n\n* Artists who get rooms should be trying to make a living with their art. \n* Those with rooms should be planning to spend most of their working time at Tau. Those with desks should spend enough time there to be an active part of the community.\n* Is open to and has capacity for involving others in their work and practice\n* Wants to help others develop as makers and artists\n* Wants to bring their own expertise to build Studio Tau\n* Takes responsibility for developing Tau as a whole for the benefit of all Blivande members.\n\nIn addition to this, there are the personal aspects of that we get along with the person and would like to work with them.\n\n## Who are the current artists in residence? \n\nOur current artists in residence with rooms are Simon Cederquist and Maria Euler. Simon was offered his residency in December 2018. Maria started her residency in February. @asapienza has a fixed desk, currently in the big common room in the corner of Tau.\n\n## For how long is an artist a resident?\nWe are building a community, and a stable place, rather than a short term residency program. Our artists in residence have their status long term and until further notice, and as long as they are still interested in continuing to work in ways that benefit the community and Studio Tau.", "created_at": "2019-01-29 16:55:40.270000", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 13:13:36.722138", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 439, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 37.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3032, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 709, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Welcome Yuri!\n\nI would love to see more music related events in the house, especially workshops and courses.

By doing so the group felt it was a bit easier to get started as well.\n\n2. 1-3 guidelines for check-in culture:  \nstart each day with a short meeting just to get started, to make sure everyone knows what they\u00b4re doing.\n have a \u201dfika\u201d break, just talk for a few minutes after lunch every day. It doesn\u2019t have to be about work, it can also be just a check in to see what is up with everyone and how they\u2019re doing.   \n\n3. 1-3 guidelines for online calls: \n intially everyone should be using the video function so that the person speaking can see who they\u2019re speaking to. Depending on the meeting, at least the person talking should be using the camera. \n the participants that are not talking should always have their microphone muted to avoid annoying/disturbing sounds. \ninstead of just asking questions or start talking out loud, the participants should be using functions like chat and raise hand.  \n\n4. 1-3 platforms to use for different types of asynchronous collaboration:\nChat: for conversations that don\u2019t need to be documented, for example questions or opinions and  discussions. Pro: The data is not saved. Con: Important information may go missing. \nMail: A good plattform for contacting external members of the project. Also good for sharing the same information with all members involved in the project. \nGoogle Drive: A good platform for sharing files and information with each other. Con: there is a risk that valuable information goes missing if one member of the group edits a document without the rest of the groups agreement, since the information may not be saved anywhere else.  \n\n5.", "created_at": "2020-09-18 13:48:04.785437", "updated_at": "2020-09-18 13:48:04.785437", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 70.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34, 342], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5680, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1206, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I borrowed the van from Folk Lab for 5 days, we paid 2000 SEK + tax.

The alternatives all have major downsides that make them very difficult in our current situation, but in different ways.\n\nThe self-locking doors/cylinders (like the one we have on the narrow door by the main entrance) are quite simple to manipulate/open. They also void our insurance coverage as they are not certified by insurance companies (yes, this is a potentially big problem that we have to solve). \n\nThe other way to go is to install electronically controlled motor cylinders (this is basically what all companies use), but these are super expensive. Just the locking mechanism itself can cost +15000 and then you have all the installation, pulling cables etc. Ends up 20-30 K per door. Luckily we have 1-2 of these locks saved from the doors being thrown out, but it will still cost a shitload of money to get this installed for all doors. It's not just the locks themselves but also control systems with timers, connection to fire alarm for automatic unlocking responses etc. \n\nA further complicating aspect here is that we run events, which limits us legally in terms of what locks we can have installed. It's not legal for us to have self-locking mechanisms that can't be opened from the inside with emergency \"panic handles\" etc. And if they can be opened from the inside by anyone the insurance companies again won't cover us. So that basically would force us to have double cylinders in all doors (one electronically controlled system + a manual one that can only be opened or locked with some kind of key or equivalent). The cost of that will have to be added on top of the cost for the machine locks. It's a real pain in the ass. And you're still back to having the centralized need of a person in charge of \"locking up and closing down for the night\". Which of course doesn't gel well with our type of house, business and community. \n\nAt least we have cameras now so I can control who it is that forgets to lock doors and remind and/or reprimand them until they learn.

We are three students of different fields who are interning with @jonasjohansson at Svartljus - A collective building dynamic lighting installations on improvised locations. All three of us are on the finish line of our education. \n\n@susannaengstrom  (SWE) is studying Audiovisual Production in Dalarna.\n@claes_gammelgaard  (DK) is a Design-Lead student and @victoria_albrecht (GER) is learning more about the world of Animation as Motion Creative student. Both are students at Hyper Island, Stockholm.\n\nWith these forum post we want to keep you updated about our process, would like to open up conversations and keep pushing the importance of creativity and community. \n\n**SUSANNA**\n\nStarting a new project is always difficult, to throw yourself into something new. It's both scary and exciting at the same time. So this week, it was mostly about getting started which felt difficult most days. Something I've learned new this week is that I should stop looking for creativity and just get started and work. Then the inspiration comes to you when you least expect it.\n\n**VICTORIA**\n\nThe creative part which I wanted to explore became more and more clear last week. Abstract light painting is **an art form since 1889** (!). Have a look if you have in interest in the [history of light painting.](https://lightpaintingphotography.com/light-painting-history) To combine new learnings about tech and coding I brought existing passion for typography into the game. The past week started with a midnight test outside of the Blivande house at Frihamnstorget behind the containers\n\n![55|690x290](upload://2c4V9LiSxEewNzHl2QKNQxp6EX0.jpeg) \n\nThe next step was to test different fonts, which we got from font designers* during our open call [\"Text Type Light\"](https://text-type-light.glitch.me/). It was time to see how well they work = readable with the glow and blurry effect I add in Touchdesigner. The thinner typefaces needed a extra stroke around and the bolder ones more spacing between the letters.\n\n*It's to mention that creating fonts is a design form itself and if well and constructed a long lasting design fundament.* *\n![10|690x414](upload://frydSdcoJPT5gGOqHWQUZp03nrG.jpeg)\n\nJonas and me collected all submissions we got and had to make a selection of 20 text/words which we wanted to document. Most participants connected their text to a certain place in Stockholm and the result was a well planned route with a lot of excitement. \n\nStill executing 20 poems in one night was ambitious...\n\n![00|617x500](upload://9LSs8ouoLBGwXvS0Ml6my0oHQ66.png) \n\n...and we didn't managed to do all of them, BUT we learned a lot, had a lot of fun while freezing in the empty streets of Stockholm. \n\n![01|672x500](upload://bhUU5d31MnqsCjDRdh7Vzdslv5B.jpeg) *Picture by Susanna*\n\nPersonally I got super pumped to continue with this project - there are so many options how to use this tool aka the pixelstick. Here is one preview of an animation we did at Skogskyrog\u00e5rden:\n\n![19|690x364](upload://oqBLEYXWxuPpMikgjYg8rVtTilA.png) \n\n\n**CLAES**\n\nThe installation is finally done! \nThis week was spent finishing up the installation and making a teaser for it. \n\n[**Watch the installation teaser here!**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DKi59r3-c0ZWynxKIZ12Hq_S0JTmc0J/view?usp=sharing) (Remember headphones!)\n\nThe installation itself is now finished but still trying to plan with a place to either have some sort of event showcasing the installation itself or to come setup the installation and record it as a video that will be consumed as shortfilm instead of the installation. \n\nThank you all for your help!  \ud83c\udf38\u2764\ufe0f\n\nIn parallel with figuring that out, I will begin on a new project.

We're hoping to find a solution that fits, but it's possible that we have over-specified our way into a dead-end.\n\n## Very short brief\n\nPlato is the umbrella term for a package of software to steward grassroots organized places and events. It's a package that we will offer as a bundle that comes with a tried and tested methodology, but all the different components of Plato can also be run on their own. Some of the software of Plato is custom built from scratch while other parts are slightly modified or extended versions of available open-source software.\n\n* [Plato Dreams](https://dreams.wtf/) helps an organization come up with, refine and prioritize between projects to work on and fund. It is similar to an internal Kickstarter, but where projects are tied to a collective fund that resources are distributed from by the org members. Dreams has a GraphQL API.\n\n* [Plato Realities](http://realities.theborderland.se/) helps an organization keep track of who is responsible for what, what the dependencies between responsibilities are, and how these responsibilities are carried out. It has a GraphQL API.\n\n* Discourse is the preferred discussion platform for Plato. When Dreams is paired with Discourse, each Dream has a Discourse thread that serves the comment section to Dreams through the Discourse API. When not paired with Discourse, Dreams has its own native comment system. Discourse has a REST-API.\n\n* Edgeryders OpenEthnographer and Graphryder are used in Plato when paired with the Edgeryders flavor of Discourse, to enable ethnography of a community conversation.\n\n* Plato Discourse plugin is planned to allow a user to label a thread on Discourse as belonging to a specific Dream or Reality by selecting from a list of options relevant to the organizations and events the user has access to.\n\n* Pretix, an open-source ticket platform, can be paired with Dreams to issue tickets to community events. Having a ticket on Pretix to an event on Dreams allows a user to participate in project creation and participatory budgeting. Pretix can be extended with plugins. Pretix has a REST-API.\n\nWe are building Plato in 2020-2021 and testing it at Blivande and Frihamnstorget. We will run at least two festivals at Frihamnstorget using Plato during this time \u2013 one in the fall of 2020 if the situation allows for it, and one in the spring of 2021.\n\nIn 2021 we (SenseStack/Edgeryders) aim to sell Plato to clients who manage places, organize festivals, want to try participatory conferences, or need innovative ways for community engagement.\n\n## Requirements and preferences\n\n* We want Dreams, Realities, and Discourse to be separately deployable and still be useful\n\n* We want to enable a single sign-on to Dreams, Realities, and Discourse.\n\n* We want to control which organizations a user belongs to on Dreams and Realities from a single place.\n\n* We want to have access to the Edgeryders ethnography software on Discourse\n\n* We want the Blivande Edgeryders forum to host the first iteration of Plato for Blivande\n\n* We prefer the SSO integration to Dreams and Realities to be based on a protocol like OAuth2 that makes it likely to work with potential future client SSO requirements.\n\n* We want user bios, avatars, and contact details to be set in Discourse when Plato is deployed with Discourse, and that information could then be displayed on Dreams and Realities.\n\n* We want to give a user access rights to the right Dreams event automatically when a ticket is issued to that user through Pretix.\n\n* We want the Pretix ticket issuing flow to involve a step (through a Pretix plugin) where a user either logs in with their existing SSO account or signs up for an account through a single step.\n\n* We would like the confirmation e-mail for a new account registered through the Plato Pretix to be contextual, for example welcoming a user to the Festival community on the Blivande forum.\n\n* We want our chosen solutions to be scalable with Dreams, Realties, Discourse and Pretix deployed for production where new organizations can be added at a manageable cost.\n\n## Coming up with a solution\n\n### Alternative 1: Using Discourse as the SSO provider\n\nOur first go-to solution was to use Discourse as the SSO provider and id-provider. This would look something like this:\n\n![Plato%20Architecture%20-%20New%20frame|666x499](upload://2rKRlK71Gp5THadmxHnbXhYnUVs.jpeg) \n\n#### Problem 1: Non-standard solution\n\nTo the best of my understanding, there is a recommended way for how to [use Discourse as an SSO provider](https://meta.discourse.org/t/using-discourse-as-a-sso-provider/32974). However, it looks a bit hacky and very specific to Discourse. This is contrary to one of our preferences:\n\n> * We prefer the SSO integration to Dreams and Realities to be based on a protocol like OAuth2 that makes it likely to work with potential future client SSO requirements.\n\n#### Problem 2: Org membership\n\nHow would we define belonging to an organization on Edgeryders communities? When a user logs in with their SSO enabled account to Dreams and Realities, we need to be able to pass information from the SSO provider on which organizations the user is a member of. One way to do this could be through defining groups on Edgeryders Communities, but I don't know if that would work as expected.\n\n#### Problem 3: Confusing registration process\n\nA user who just wants to participate in an event and buys a ticket to that event will get confused by getting a confirmation email from \"Edgeryders Communities\". Seeing that I'm just getting people at Blivande used to Edgeryders, it's a bit much to ask from someone at the community entry-level. \n\nWould it be possible to somehow keep track of where a registration originated from and send a confirmation email accordingly? Would it also be possible to automate bringing the user to the right sub-forum without having them need to click the right icon?\n\nWhat comes to mind is a Discourse plugin where any number of custom parameter strings are paired with confirmation email massages and target URLs to continue to after email verification. Perhaps there are other, better solutions.\n\n### Alternative 2: Logging in with a third-party SSO\n\nAnother alternative that might work would be to add a stand-alone id and SSO provider like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to the Plato stack. However, since we want to use the Edgeryders fora for Plato, we would need to allow for a third-party SSO provider to act as an OAuth2 provider for Edgeryders Communities.\n\nThis solves all problems above but introduces new problems.\n\nThat would look something like this:\n\n![Plato%20Architecture%20-%20New%20frame%20(1)|518x499](upload://xMsQHNOxT0UKG59LZFoREYdhZ1L.jpeg) \n\n#### Problem 1: No idea if viable for Edgeryders Communities\n\nI have no idea if this would work or if it would cause all kinds of problems.\n\n#### Problem 2: Introduces an extra piece of software with marginal benefits\n\nAdding another identity provider does not seem as elegant. However, using a dedicated id-provider also gives us access to standard auth protocols and a more powerful way to handle user permissions in a central place.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nWe need some help making sense of our options, and would love to work with @matthias and @daniel on this.

The expectation is that clicking any of those will provide me with more information, probably even images since it's a big ol' flip card with an image and text. Instead, I get a tiny amount of information and a somewhat obscure button that say's \"tell me more\". Obscure as the pointer icon appears on both the card and the black surface, without any indication as to which one is active.\n\nIn my mind I'm like \"Yes, I want to know more, that's why I clicked in the first place!\". And if I accidentally click wrong, the cards flip back, and I have to click it - yet again, and then do it right.\n\n2. The Flip Card effect is (to me) somewhat outdated and belongs in the past - as many/most modern sites have a flatter approach, light - straight forward. Same goes for parallax, as they both share the same origin of 10-15 years ago (I remember heavily being asked to do Parallax sites in my early 20s). Not really an argument, more of a personal statement :slight_smile:\n\nPerhaps on Desktop you could set it to be a Hover, so the click is obvious? :) (compromise)\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:11, topic:1154\"]\nYeah, maybe. I\u2019ll give it some thought. I think that section also adds something with its \u201cby sharing our resources, we can all afford to be more generous\u201d bit.\n[/quote]\n\nI understand the reasoning, however, I would argue that Frihamnstorget is such an impressive part of Blivande, and neither the tiny flip card nor the 40% visible image with somewhat difficult text on top does it justice.

If for example there is a culture established that finished art is without exception or distinction deemed \"sacred\" and/or permanent that would make at least me significantly more hesitant when it comes to supporting new initiatives without due process. \n\nOne clear example of this is how the spontaneous painting of the BL container by Mike and the girlfriend of Manju (Amelia?) during the September event build happened. They were allowed to do this (from my point of view) based on an assumed underlying principle of \"easy come, easy go\". \nAs there wasn't any clear process to it nor any preparatory work or other such kind of efforts. \n\n\"By all means go wild, we can always paint over it\"\n\nTo me this differs fundamentally from the other side of the same container where the artist Johan was specifically and individually invited to do a planned piece. Then some expectation of longevity can certainly be allowed for IMO.\n\nTo be clear I personally regard the Beckman's communal painting experiment a great thing as a creative process and I'm really happy that we can enable such things to happen with the square. I'm grateful to Jonas for making it a reality. In terms of actual aesthetical outcome though that's a different discussion altogether. And to be perfectly honest me and my subjectivity find it pretty ugly... :) \n\nBut that's also to be expected from a collective painting experiment involving many people without previous experience of spraycans, foregoing the use of masking tape on a corrugated surface etc. And I would like us to be able to continue taking risks and allowing for playfulness.

It is up to them to decide. The way I host internships is that I provide space for personal growth and individual learning ambitions. We will also work on installations for the house, such as setting up a lighting rig for the dance room.\n\nLast year had the amazing @IdaMaria which is the reason I am so excited to continue this journey with new faces and energy!\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this project, please forward them to me, or ask in this thread.", "created_at": "2020-03-09 19:02:10.167434", "updated_at": "2020-03-10 14:03:34.952264", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 276, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 143.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 54, 205], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1797, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 459, "post_number": 13, "raw": "I agree that the visual outcome of this particular container is in direct relation to its prerequisites.

You can't have \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 in the filename/path where your Carbide Create file resides (there is a comment in the g-code file with it in it). You will get a error prompt about illegal characters if you do. Either open the file in notepad and remove the first line (anything in parenthesis in a comment in g-code so you don't break anything), or move your project away from a path with \u00f6\u00e4\u00e5 and resave the Carbide Create file and then regenerate the g-code.\n\n2. If you use two endmills in your project, you can't z-zero them both. So you have to divide up your file for each endmill, and z-zero in the beginning of each file. In Carbide Create you can disable paths so you don't need 2 Carbide Create projects, just 2 g-code files.\n3. Try not to put double sided tape where you mill. Its sticky and not very nice to run the endmills through it.\n4. Changing the collet (if you want to change the endmill) is a bitch. But by pressing your finger against it, and wiggling it it's doable. If you're not using the 12mm one, you can also use something thats wider then the endmill but narrower then whatever you put the collet in, and just push that through (we used a pen on the 6mm collet).\n\n/Bj\u00f6rn", "created_at": "2020-05-01 20:35:08.410504", "updated_at": "2020-05-01 20:35:08.410504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 270, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [3900], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4309, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 955, "post_number": 42, "raw": "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.

But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man\u2014a whaleman too\u2014who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It\u2019s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head\u2014a ghastly thing enough\u2014and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat\u2014a new beaver hat\u2014when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head\u2014none to speak of at least\u2014nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.", "created_at": "2020-04-16 23:55:06.397589", "updated_at": "2020-04-16 23:55:06.397589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 539, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4524, "user_id": 14, "topic_id": 635, "post_number": 34, "raw": "IMHO you should use the Shaper Origin whenever you can, because it's a hell of a lot easier to use.\n\nReasons to opt for the ShapeOko3 would include:\n\n-You need to do a cut that has a significant 3D component.

You keep leading by example in this regard, really cool!\n\n----\n\nPersonally I wouldn't like to go as far as you're suggesting (in my interpretation). That is having a culture where there is a spoken or unspoken rule that input and feedback is *always* preceded by a polite inquiry so as to not risk upsetting anyone or their mojo/ego/flow/pride/joy etc. Keyword being \"always\" here. Fingerspitzengefuhl is called for, as so often in life. There are risks also with such a polite approach in my view.\n\nI believe it can eventually lead to a milder form of a \"culture of silence\" of sorts where one simply avoids certain topics or people (most often a combo of the two) simple because it isn't \"worth it\" due to the emotional fallout. Ironically similar to what happens in the opposite environment with suffocating criticism (or indeed too much unwanted feedback) which also breeds silence and avoidance.\n\nThe responsibility for the emotional fallout mentioned above does not always land on the person asking or giving the feedback but can also equally be held by the receiver. Most often it is shared between the two to some degree or the other. But importantly we all are responsibility for our feelings and to what degree we allow them to steer our lives and actions. I also think it overall can be detrimental to a project's creative output or \"treshold of originality\" (verksh\u00f6jd in Swedish) if the group members are \"too polite\" towards each other. I wouldn't want Frihamnstorget to fall victim of the \"skyddad verkstad\"-phenomenon.\n\n### I would rather argue for moderation in everything, *including* moderation. There's always a balance to strike in every situation. \n\nIn other words let's *not* \"go full Steve Jobs\" and end up sacrificing each other and our relationships on the altar of imagined and very much subjective perfection, but -also- let's avoid the opposite ditch where we treat each other like we weren't fully capable adults (most of the time at least).

Do you remember a good example of remote collaboration you had in the past?\nWe think that structures are important to make a remote collaboration work. Trying not to interrupt people. Having an agenda is important. We also think it's important to meet face to face regularly. \nWhen it comes to different school projects, we have benefited greatly from different types of platforms where you can work together in one and the same document municipality. For example, Word online.\n2. Propose 1-3 guidelines for regular check-in culture\nHaving a regular time can make it easier, for example meeting every Friday afternoon. Keep this check-in meeting informal and use it to say hello and ask how your week has been and ask each other if they need assistance with a task or activity. Keep these check-in meetings short. See it more as a \u201cfika\u201d rather than a meeting where decisions are taken. \n3. Propose 1-3 guidelines for online calls\n\nStructus and agenda we think is the most important thing, so people don't interrupt each other. Having the webcam on makes it easier. If you don't have a webcam on you can not read body language or facial expressions, which makes it harder to understand each other. It is important that every person that is participating check for disturbing sounds before starting the online call, otherwise it can be hard for others to focus on the meeting. \n\nIt is also important to remember to log in with the camera at the beginning of the meeting, in this way you get a more social connection to the other participants of the meeting. And they also serve as a confirmation that the colleagues are personally involved in the conversation.\n\n4. Propose 1-3 platforms you would like to use for different types of asynchronous collaboration (pros and cons if possible)\n\nDepending on the seriousness of the question, if you need an answer right away you might wanna call. Sending an formal email if it needs to be on the record. We think that google docs is a good way to work together. It saves a lot of time. You can make direct comments that everyone can see and you can chat in the program directly.  \n\n5. Propose a creative remote social interaction\n\nYou could have a quiz via zoom or maybe you could have like an afterwork with your colleagues through zoom or microsoft teams. Workouts, yoga, meditation could also be possible via zoom. The online calls could be more personal if every member did a house tour of the space that they are working in. Then the different members could get to know each other more.\n\nOskar Ekman, Alice Ekman, Christian Kjellsson och Mathias Bj\u00f6rkman", "created_at": "2020-09-24 10:13:42.603663", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 10:13:42.603663", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 461, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 47.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1355, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 270, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Sounds good!

The cost of renting toilets would be pregranted as this necessity should not be a part of the public granting. However, decoration of the toilets is not necessary, but a nice to have, which can be covered by the public granting.\n\n**Granting:**\n\n* You decide on what date the public granting run should start and when it should end.

If the humidity in the house is below 30 to 40 percent (it probably is during winter), plants will benefit from an occasional misting of their foliage.\n\n![](upload://24IvoWFvIGJMrOgOz3d1KXwehSR.jpeg)\n**Name(s):** \n**Watering:** Manual\n**Notes:**  \n\n![](upload://sE2rNMYzQLTwvszHLlsvMXxtlX3.jpeg)\n**Name(s):** Chrysalidocarpus lutescens (Guldpalm)\n**Watering:** Manual.

The Spouter-Inn.\n\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\n\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.\u2014It\u2019s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.\u2014It\u2019s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.\u2014It\u2019s a blasted heath.\u2014It\u2019s a Hyperborean winter scene.\u2014It\u2019s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture\u2019s midst.  *That*  once found out, and all the rest were plain.

I very much agree with the overall feel and content of the document. \n\n>Blivande is founded on the belief that\nbuilding networked ecosystems of\ncreative people emerged in the principles\nof participatory culture can help meet\nchallenges in society as a whole.\n\nYou really want to write \"emerged in\" here? I would have written \"immersed in the principles\" or \"emerging from the principles\".  \n\n>Members in the arts involve members in\ntheir projects who do not identify as artists,\nand trust and understanding is build among\nthem.\n\n\"...trust and understanding is *built* among them.\"\n\n> Incentives are used to cultivate the best\npossible ecosystem, rather than for profit.\n\nSlight syntax error. Maybe rather something like \"Incentives are geared towards cultivating a regenerative ecosystem; priming its members to strive for collaboration and symbiotic synergy rather than individualistic monetary profit.\"?\n\n>  From 2022 and\nforward, Frihamnstorget would be our main\navenue of expansion and growth.\n\nWould replace \"forward\" with \"onward\", but that's very minor.  \n\n>  If we ***recieve***\ngrants from Region Stockholm, we plan to\nhire a Coordinating Director and an Outreach\nCoordinator\n\n-> receive\n\n> There may only be 40 members, but the\nrelations between them are many more! Each\nrelation in the network should be given care\nand attention.\n\nI think it might be better to write \"There may be only 40 members\" (if you can be bothered as both are technically still correct). The current phrasing tilts towards indicating that \"there may only be 40 members\" as if there was a cap. I think it's a Swenglish type of word placement in this context, but I could be wrong. Maybe @kimgajraj could chime in her as a native speaker.  \n\n>Blivande currently has a team of 10 people who\nwork on maintaining the core activities and\ndoing outreach and engagement for Blivande\nas a whole. Most of these are unpaid and only\ncompensated through free memberships. Some\nof the core team are paid through project grants\nspecific to their line of work. This includes\ncommunity management and outreach for the\nVinnova-funded Plato Project.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's to our benefit or not to seem \"bigger\" than we are in the sense that there's a huge difference between 10 full-time employees and our current \"workforce\". I would probably overestimate the size of Blivande's core crew reading this paragraph as an outsider. Can see both pros and cons with both approaches. I guess we should err on the side of seeming bigger than we actually are as that would make us seem more legitimate in the eyes of the city and the grant committees. \n\n> Frihamnstorget should be a true \u201cthird place\u201d - neither fully\nprivate nor public, curated and maintained\nby its members.\n\nWould write \"is\" or \"is to be\" rather than \"should be\". \n\n(\u00c4r kolonilotter verkligen s\u00e5 pr\u00e4glade av samarbete nuf\u00f6rtiden?

With 16 participants we started working together in September 2020 and have until June 2021 to create our collective work.\n\n**what:** 12 C.P.R.C. particiants spend half a day at Blivande to practice openess and engage locally with the community, to share our practices, and to start conversations. We invite Blivande community to the reading circle and would love to join the noon meditation.\n\n**why:** \n'*Explicitly or not collective practices determine much of what we do. They are qualified by terms like participation, group, collectivity, ensemble, collaboration, community, cooperation, sharing, assembly, commons, networks. Collective practices exist in all societies and they have a rich yet complex heritage in arts, politics and sciences. Often considered as a strictly human activity, collective practices can also be performed with or by nonhuman entities, such as animals, plants or Artificial Intelligence. How does the current ecological and technological condition affect the way that we live, work and think collectively? Which collective practices foster better understandings and transformation of societal issues?*'\n\n**who:** Around 12 particpants from all over Europe of the CPRC would like to come to Blivande; some CPRC-particpants will join online for the reading circle \n\n**suggested time schedule on Tuesday October 6th of October:**\n* 11.30-12.00    Arrival of Go to Blivande\n* 12.00-12.30    joining the daily Meditation\n* 12:30-13:30    Lunch break  (self-organized, participants bring own food)\n* [13:00-13:30] Setting up zoom equipment to share session with online participants\n* 13:30-15:30    Reading Circle on the 'Holobiont' by Sina Ribak with co-facilitation by Gregory Castera,  + ONLINE via zoom. We will read together out loud a selection of texts from Lynn Margulis and Scott F. Gilbert, learning about at symbiogenesis and it's role for co-evolution. \n* 15.30-17.00    More time to explore Blivande space\n\n**we need:** your generosity of your time, a space to sit in a circle with enough distance (covid) and calm (reading aloud together), and wifi connection (online participants) during the 2 hours of the reading circle from 13:30 - 15:30\n\n**we offer:** our curiousity, our listening and hope to give some inspiration through the 'Holobiont' reading.\n\nLooking forward to your comments, questions, suggestions.\nI'm very excited to make these plans - myself I will participate virtually only unfortunately this time - however having visited Blivande 3 weeks ago I feel this urge to connect and would be very happy to make it happen togehter. Thank you.\nbest wishes, Sina\n\n\n**TEASER for the READING CIRCLE: Beyond Individuals**\n\n\u201c*The Twentieth Century was a powerful time for thinking through individuals. Individuals were the ideological unit of political \u201cfreedom\u201d. They also became the analytic motor of influential sciences, from economics to population biology. \u201cImagine individuals,\u201d both scholars and pundits told, \u201cand you can conjure the world.\u201d*\n\n*The imagined autonomy of the individual was thought to rise or fall on its own merits, that is, through the fitness of the individuals it produced. Individuals were just one kind of self-contained unit that could be summed up or divided like building blocks, from genes to populations to species \u2013 and sometimes even to nations, religions, or civilizations.*\n\n*Today the autonomy of all these units has come under question, and each question works to undermine the edifice built from the segregation of each from each. As biologist Scott Gilbert tells us, \u201cwe have never been individuals.\u201d His \u201cwe\u201d refers to all life; his \u201cindividuals\u201d are autonomous species as well as single organisms. If most of the cells of the human body are microbes, which \u201cindividual\u201d are we? We can\u2019t segregate our species nor claim distinctive status - as a body, a genome, or an immune system. And what if evolution selects for relations among species rather than \u201cindividuals\u201d?*\nQuote from: Anna Tsing, Heather Swanson, Elaine Gan, Nils Bubandt (eds.)

Will make it happen in the coming weeks. \n\n[quote=\"hampus, post:1, topic:1114\"]\n**HAMPUS:** Paint Beckman\u2019s container (outer side)\n[/quote]", "created_at": "2020-06-12 09:22:50.755928", "updated_at": "2020-06-12 09:23:39.114791", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 189, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 8.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [5286, 5188], "is_reply_to": [5286], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1148, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 289, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@hampus, you had recently been to a junkyard that had a lot of art.

It could be worth adding something like \"There may as yet be only 40 members\", though I am not sure it matters that much, especially because the first paragraph says we want to expand to 80 members in 2021.

Frihamnstorget is also a place for high quality art installations, galleries, performances and other culture experiences.\n\nAgree with Hampus that it's a bit clunky. Suggestion:\n\nA typical activity at Frihamnstorget is \"Work Is Play\". Once a week, people are invited to spend the day on the square and co-create projects while a DJ plays tunes and food and drink is served from the caf\u00e9.

So to be clear, this funding is not for the project listed in this program, but for Blivande and the core staff to be able to focus on running these more interesting events rather than spending all of our time trying to cover rent and salaries.\n\nPing @filipnystrom -  this is the program for the application we've been working on.\n\nPing also @Nicke, @jonasjohansson, @Ollxor, @jakobskote, @Frida_Simon, @NinaLindberg, @bobspeakman, @missChief  - check if anything needs to be changed.

We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Let's come up with some weird shit! Let this be your guiding light: weird is good, really fucking weird is really fucking good. Don't hold back on the weird.\n\nA quick primer on Kulturbryggan: It's a Swedish arts-funding body that especially funds art and culture that is innovative and that could not find funding elsewhere because of its eclectic nature. Our community has been very successful with Kulturbryggan in the past, and those of us who have received funding include @hampus, @jakobskote, @Frida_Simon, @Nicke, myself, and others. Blivande itself was made possible through a grant from Kulturbryggan, and we also got a grant from them to build the Dreams and Realities systems for the Borderland.\n\nOver the years, we have developed a good understanding of what Kulturbryggan is looking for, and what questions a successful application might have to address. \n\nI have made a new site on Dreams as a sort of \"collaboration generation engine\" for Blivande Kulturbryggan projects. Our idea is that if we all put our projects up on that generator platform, we can help each other develop ideas that really hit the mark and have that \"little extra\" that pushes them through to success.

Not a single functional place exists in Stockholm where the growing global movement built on top of participatory art and culture is being nurtured and explored. The combination of different but compatible and cross-pollinating networks and creative spaces allows us to create economically viable hybrids and clusters (Blivande) that would otherwise not be able to survive. In perfect synergy with this, the Transforma projekt led by Hampus Lindblad, has  received 1M SEK in funding from Kulturbryggan to work towards the permanent establishment of this new kind of art and community infrastructure in Stockholm. We will combine these two initiatives by housing Transforma at Tau.\n\n## What is Studio Tau?\n\nA new place for artists and makers in Stockholm to create and co-create art in an intimate and supportive environment, driven by the ethos of participatory culture. It's a  community of selected members constantly striving towards fine-tuning the creative balance between structure/order and freedom/chaos that often is a challenge in similar environments. We do all of this in collaboration and support from national and international institutions, events and communities such as The Borderland, the international Burning Man community, KKV (Konstverket) and The Generator in Reno.\n\n## How will this happen\n\n### Phase 1 - January 1st to September 30th, 2019\n\nShorter-term and exploratory. Focused on community building, research and design ahead of the long-term second phase. During this phase it will be a limited possibility to rent rooms at Tau for groups of collaborators. There is also a \"flexible project space\", bookable (at extra cost) for intense work periods or exhibitions.\n\n### Phase 2 \u2013 After October 1st 2019, a stable era begins\n\nMore additional equipment and specialized machines will create the need to expand common rooms at the expense of the private ones. We will become a larger community, growing from ~15 to ~35 artists. The all access membership with no private room will be the predominant one available, with a few exceptions for artists-in-residence.\n\nEventually, there might be extra storage space in the shape of nearby furnished containers and/or warehouses made available as the port related business move out to Nyna\u0308shamn.\n\n### Membership\n\nDuring Phase 1, we have two membership tiers (basic access or room access) where the room access adds a premium on top of the basic 800 SEK/month membership cost. This premium is calculated per m2 with some smaller variations between different rooms depending on standard.\n\nWhen Phase 2 begins, there will no longer be private rooms, but on the other hand there will be much more equipment available to use and create with, not no mention a booming community.\n\n# Some frequently asked questions\n\n### What are the benefits of having your own room during Phase 1?\n\nThe benefits are mainly that of having your own space. You can also be a standard member during Phase 1, paying 800 SEK+VAT. I.e. it's possible to also be a non-room member before Oct 1. \n\nIn other words having your own space boils down to significantly larger storage space and more privacy/freedom to share space with people of your very own choosing. \n\n### Will there be lockable shelves / boxes in Tau?\n\nYes, there will absolutely be lockable storage. The exact type, form and shape isn't decided yet and we're very open to suggestions!\n\nFor very expensive stuff that doesn't take up much volume we will use the old walk-in safe at Beta for high security storage. The original lock mechanism is unfortunately gone but we will retrofit the doors with a heavy duty padlock or the like, as seen on containers. \n\nWe are also actively looking for other large scale storage options in other nearby parts of Frihamnen, either in a building (ideal) or in containers (could be heated and the longside versions with multiple doors for much easier access). This would be for bulkier and less theft-prone objects such as building material and artworks. \n\n### What other security measures will be in place?\n\nThere will be an alarm system in the whole building, separated by zones that can be deactivated individually depending on what entrance is used (and what tag+code is being applied). \n\nYou are also free to install an online security camera in your own private space if you so desire, and for example a Yale Doorman digital lock on the door. We will have those (or similar ones) installed on the shared rooms with specialized machines that require special knowledge to use.\n\n----------\n\n# Join Studio Tau\n\nStudio Tau is a curated space for members and their occasional guests. Your first step towards becoming a member is introducing yourself and getting to know the community. As you've noticed by now, we've chosen to have our information on a forum rather than a website, which is testament to our social nature and the co-creation and relation building that lies at the heart of House Blivande. Why don't you go ahead and [introduce yourself in a post in our forum](https://forum.blivande.com/t/what-have-we-been-up-to-art-wise-prior-to-joining-tau/102)? What do you want to create?\n\nOnce we've had a conversation and gotten to know each other, you'll likely be invited to become a member. You can then go sign up for a membership, for 800 SEK per month, paid quarterly.\n\n### Once you have been invited: [Sign up for Studio Tau](https://blivande.smpl.io/join?location=studio-tau&plan=studio-tau-membership&startdate=1546297200000)\n\n----------\n\n# Questions?\n\nDon't be shy, go ahead and ask! We've chosen to have a forum rather than a static website for a reason. If you have a question, chances are you are not the only one.

Been having some health problems, nothing severe but having me unable to get around to doing stuff.\n\nLast I was there we had an introductory course, but those attending probably needed more hands-on examples done, and help along their first solo projects to feel sure about using the machine. I was a bit rusty, and learning by doing is the best way. Its hard to condense and convey methods learned/developed over years of use. \n\nSo, to get cracking again, we first need to work out the issues with the machine, since it has not been running properly. In the spirit of learning together, and me being long-winded, I'm gonna type out the trouble shooting here in the forum. Hopefully we can resolve it faster this way too.\n\n**Olle reports it drops significantly in power after running for a while. There are many factors that can reduce power.** \nMost are due to regular use of the machine, and therefore are addressed in regular maintenance. *Smoke residue on lens/mirrors/laser tube business end, Poor fume evacuation.*\nOther factors are incorrect settings.\n*power/speed setting in software overridden/reduced in machine settings, incorrect focus*\nAlso mirror calibration can be off, and the laser tube degrades as a whole with use, etc..\n\n**BUT...**\nIntermittent power loss, that occurs after running a while, is probably because one of two hardware bits being at the end of its life. The laser tube power supply, which brings the voltage upp to a cosy ~20KV DC and exites the CO2 gas in the tube to produce the energy. If this one is old and tired it can have reduced effect as it is working and getting warm.\n\nThe other probable cause is insufficient cooling.

(Will be defined on an organisational level, and can be picked and chosen for each event)\n\n* for now just one text box with the guidelines just for the frihamnstogets festival event:\n\nIssues to discuss on Thursday for the Festival grant guidelines:\n\nGuideline guidelines:\n\n* We are giving people free money, how do we onboard them to this?\n* Ownership! Things that are proposed to become a permanent part of Frihamnstorget has to be vetted by the existing projects at Frihamnstorget.\n  * How do we make decisions on new projects?\n  * How do we avoid people being suspicious of an AB giving out free stuff?\n  * This is a different kind of festival.\n  * Where is the money coming from?\n  * Who owns the projects after?\n * Guideline on how to \"onboard new projects permanent members/crews? What does \"ownership\" mean to us? Things that are proposed to become a permanent part of Frihamnstorget has to be vetted by the existing projects at Frihamnstorget.\n   * How do we make decisions on new projects?\n   * \"Soft Veto\" rights of existing projects? (find another way to say this)\n* Don't be an asshat: e.g. Don't do anything that forces us to make more rules in the future.\n* What are dreamers allowed to seek money for? Restricted items etc. (provide models)\n  * Do we fund salaries? Examples:\n    * 1. 20% of your requested budget can be allocated to salaries. (20% of the budget you request from the dreams platform)\n    * 2. 5000 SEK max. For salary for one person during a specified time.\n    * 3. No salaries. All work is pro bono. Salaries can still be funded from outside project funding.\n    * 4. No limits on budgeting for salaries.\n  * These guidelines have to be very simple.\n\n* Can dreamers be paid up front? In negotiation with the community.\n  * Allow all payments upfront.\n  * Allow no payments upfront\n  * Allow some payments upfront (how to choose? Committee? contract needed?)\n  * Everyone that gets paid will submit an invoice to Blivande. >> find some company or service to invoice through. VAT included in budgets. \n  * Does each invoice need to include all receipts so we know the dreamer have followed their budget?\n* Have a working plan and team for constructing the project.\n  * What are the requirements?\n  * Describe your crew!\n  * (Should you be able to search for crew members?) (will be discussed in a different place)\n* Have a contingency plan for your project after the project.\n  * What are the requirements?\n* \u201cUnnecessary Material\u201d\n  * What do we already have?\n  * What is reasonable?\n  * Inlcude link to borderland guidelines\n\n* How to comment and give feedback on dreams? ((box-ticking?) Make your own first comment specifying for which type of feedback you are looking) (put that into the description)\n  * By putting a dream on the platform you agree to receive feedback on it.\n  * Dreamers decide themselves what feedback they seek, they define this in their first comment.\n  * In your first comment: What type of feedback are you looking for? What crewmembers are you looking for? What other contributions are you looking for?\n* What language is the dreams platform in?\n  * Simple english. Dreamers can request translation help on discourse.\n\nImportant features that will be added:\n\n* Budget will be calculated by the budget items.\n* There will be an option into the budget of already acquired funding and self-funding\n\n\n\nParked:\n\n* Find crewmembers!\n\nNotes for us:\n\nClear guidelines on how to get reimbursed.

Studio Beta has room for 30 members, having either their own adjustable desks or the flexibility to sit where they feel like. \n\nBeta has five different work rooms with very different vibes and two meeting rooms which you can book for that important client meeting or when you need some serious crunch time with a colleague. We are different from other workspaces in that creativity, participatory culture and art are at the core of Studio Beta. All members of our workspace have full access to Studio Tau, our 300 m2 big, well equipped art workshop and maker space on the first floor of House Blivande. \n\n# Memberships at Studio Beta\n\nAll memberships give you 24/7 access to Studio Beta and Studio Tau in House Blivande. Coffee, printers, wifi, bookable meeting rooms, phone booths are all included. And best of all, every new member gets to pick the next vinyl record we add to our growing collection! Vinyl records are the only allowed medium of music on our spectacular sound system in the inner hall, so make your pick a good one.\n\n## Flexible memberships \n\nA flexible membership grants you freedom and five rooms to choose from. Spend one day in the comfortable multicoloured couches in our inner hall listening to vinyl records. Spend the next at a desk in our oasis of plants.  Yet another in the comfortable armchairs of the curiosity cabinet. Or why not take your laptop down to Studio Tau and spend the day smelling freshly cut wood and work to the tune of CNC-machines buzzing and sewing-machines humming. House Blivande is your 1000 m2 oyster, for you to explore! Only rule is that you need to leave your workplace clean and empty once it's time to go home.\n\n## Fixed memberships \n\nA fixed membership grants you your very own dominion of a desk, your own flat kingdom of adjustable height, located wherever room you please. By the miracle of electricity it can be raised or lowered at your convenience. Upon your stately desk, you have your very own 27 inch display, courtesy of House Blivande. This is your desk. You can pile it up with books, your collection of porcelain dolls and pictures of your great aunt Gertrud. Or you can keep it clean and simple, Scandinavian minimalist style, to fit the machine of productivity that you are. And when you feel like exploring, you are just as welcome to roam around as the next man. Comfortable couches and curiosity cabinets await you, and your stuff will be just as you left it once you return.\n\nIn plain english, a fixed membership grants you:\n\n1. Your own electric adjustable desk\n2. Your very own comfortable chair\n3. A 27 inch display\n\n## Become a member\n\n1. Introduce yourself. Either by a post here in this very forum, in an email to one of the Blivande crew, or by dropping by the house. We're looking to create a good and diverse community, and if there is space we will invite you to become a member.\n\n2. Try it out for a day or two. See how it feels. When you feel ready to commit, sign up with the invite link we give you and approve the terms and conditions.\n\n3. Choose your membership. A flexible membership costs 2500 SEK per month + VAT and a fixed membership costs 3900 SEK + VAT per month. Both memberships are billed in advance to your credit or debet card, every three months.\n\n4.

Yes, set this up more internally with a shared Google doc with a rota for managers to sing up 6-hour shifts. I picked managers around the beginning who Hampus and I saw had good leadership skills and had been coming to volunteer a lot. Some of these we knew before. You can see the schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nem2QTUf5Tk9TkGQ9alIEbubQz8M6zrFOdKTBlZWvJg/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nManagers are given an information document on how to take care of a shift. You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XOeXl7LVpKoK-oLDdbVOiG80m5tjXYGJXAe-2gP0sBE/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nManagers put their phone numbers at the top of the schedule, and both the schedule and the information doc are in our shared folders so that anybody can see who is the duty manager at any time and call them if needed. \n\nI try and make sure manager spots are filled for a full week ahead. When we advertise for volunteers to sign up, we notify that a production manager will be on duty for all shifts.\n\nI am coordinating the production managers and am responsible for all spots being filled, all the managers knowing what they are doing, that important things going on (big orders, deliveries, arrival of materials etc.) are communicated to the managers team. Finding new people to be managers if we can't fill all our shifts. Hampus or myself are on hand to answer questions or troubleshoot, either by phone/messenger or on site. I also take production manager shifts myself. So I think it works well to have a kind of Lead or Realizer of the production team specifically in this role.  \n\nWe are finding it hectic with new people are arriving freely at all times, so from tomorrow, we are going to follow Farsta and invite newbies at three specific times throughout the day (Farsta do two but are running for fewer hours in the day), so we can do all the onboarding in one go at those times. Great to learn from each other on these things!\n\nWe are also going to re-introduce volunteer signup from tomorrow. Personally I feel it worked well in the beginning when we had low numbers of volunteers just to express to everyone how needed they were and tell them just to come at any time. However, Farsta launched using Doodle and have a great flow of volunteers, and perhaps people prefer the sense of structure. I expect both approaches work great in most cases. \n\nIf anyone has more questions feel free to post them here or call me on 0706817331", "created_at": "2020-04-18 06:47:28.444880", "updated_at": "2020-04-18 06:48:42.208224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 434, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 61.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [4330], "is_liked_by": [8, 227], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3507, "user_id": 205, "topic_id": 794, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey all! \n\nAre there more people in our community interested in marketing and having ideas about how to spread the word about us?\n\nI would love to get a small group together to work with the strategy, narrative and content for the house.

The exhibition was a bus-trip where we had diffrent \"bus-stops\" where it was art works in connection to that space (outside). It was an open call and everyone was welcome to apply. I showed an Hydrophonic-system that I made in an abandoned bus-stop that me and other artist have made into a green house. In the hydrophonic system I put cuttings to grow. The cuttings was from different people (example from cuttings groups on facebook). When I got the cuttings I also got a story behind it, how they got the \"mother plant\", a memories about the plant. The art work is called: Growing collective memories.\nI was inspired of how people have moved and been brining plants with them, how plants have been given through generations and also reading about have plants can learn and have a memory.\n\n![la%CC%8Angtifra%CC%8An|375x500](upload://fCu0WjARZkHsJdhFuYV1BysjoZR.jpeg) ![sidan|375x500](upload://y9R3wkiFkdJRXU6U318tOrRfyp9.jpeg) ![va%CC%88xthusflygbussen|690x457](upload://sjrUroEXnls9fEfqct5JmW5gANh.jpeg) \n\nOther examples of works: www.saraekholmeriksson.com\n![gavelstromdalenoverwiev|690x441](upload://3vv8KWLAbyZrAfVU4fcxde0Jsag.jpeg) \n![ga%CC%88vlela%CC%88ngreifra%CC%8An|599x500]\n![ekotopgalleri1|690x453](upload://yX8GfrfhlQnIGsYkOs3mWw063Fq.jpeg) (upload://4IjZZ4xv181FT6qTKIJZMl9fKf7.jpeg) \n\nI would like to do something with other artist at Borderland!\nI like to work with materials like projections, fluorescent, vibrations, hologram, smoke, plants, food.\nCreate a social meeting place and interested in subjects about nature and climate change.\n\nSo thats a bit of me !
