The situation in Hurghada is much simpler than Cairo for example, there are not so many key players, but coordinating between them is not an easy task; coordination between the informal system and the formal one, between the \"freelance\" garbage collectors who have no official papers, and the garbage dealers who buy, collect and sell to the bigger dealers to the dump to surprisingly shipping to Cairo some recyclables and the official company and employees, plus the local community living in formal and informal areas.

I think I will have more questions then answers at the end of the ride, but lets still try to make a fruitful read.\n\nFirst, you have to know i was diagnosed with mild borderline personality disorder a couple of years ago. While the most extreme outrages are now under control i still can have anxiety attacks that will block me, for a couple of days and i will be unreliable to contact or connect with. Knowing that most of my job is organizing events, being a project manager in small or larger groups, makes it quite a challenging. I learned to organize my life in such way that other people are bothered the least possible way and can enjoy my highs as much as possible. Some people in my entourage understand very well this liability, but in formal or new structures it is sometimes difficult to be at ease.\n\nThrough my reflection, I came across organic, collectively growing and peer to peer organization as the most suitable for myself as a person but also for people in need of a more humane approach inside organizations. In absolute terms, I see these collective entities as a machine fed by every participant regardless of the level of energy they put in, but giving back to a general audience: the collective or even broader: society. They are well engineered by core members but give place for anybody else to check in and out without to much of a change of creating conflicts, something I personally can quite difficultly manage. It\u2019s not \u2018the end by al means\u2019, but succeeding the goal while the people inside are respected as an entity. Because why would we be frustrated if at the end collectively the goal succeeded even if the energy wasn\u2019t spread evenly between the participants.  True: it sounds less engaging, but it opens a world post-individuality, where you don\u2019t need strong individual leaders all the time, but an organic set of connections between a larger group believing in the higher goal altogether.\n\nIn the next couple of paragraphs, I will present to you a couple of organizations I had the pleasure to work with, create or follow up. Each with their own structures, positive sides and biases. I will try to speak from a personal angle without criticizing any other member as I find it an important thinking exercise to help build the structure were within the people can thrive and not criticize the members for the way you want the collective to be.\n\nSoft Revolution / Pic Nic The Streets\n \nThese were my first experiences with organic organizations. The first was an artist collective drenched in the Do It Yourself spirit created by myself and a bunch of friends. We organized festivals, created a board game, wrote a book and made some meta-expositions. Through almost ten years of working together we learned from each other flaws and only worked on something when it was suitable for the whole group. What kept us going was our kindness towards each other, our understanding of the human being. But when we arrived at the crossroad between continuing an amateurish journey or professionalizing our collective we chose the second one. Not knowing the stressful implication, it had within the group while we all were stepping into our professional work environment (we started our collective when we were 16-17 till we were 24-25), we couldn\u2019t deliver the last couple of installations and had to dismantle our collective. I still hold great strengths and knowledge from this time and use it as important building stone for any other organization. Understanding each other flaws and not judging them but embracing them is something I would love to share with anybody else. We are always eager for perfection and showing the best. But if to get to that best, you have to care less about the other then it hasn\u2019t any meaning for me. It\u2019s not an absolutism, but a constant work in balance.\n\nAnother story happening around the same time goes with Pic Nic The Streets, a citizen movement started in 2012 that wanted to fight for more public space by picnicking on the main boulevard Anspach. For a couple of years, we organized systematic pic nicks, resulting in a carfree central lane, but also in spin-offs like Canal Park for a big park at Porte De Ninove and Cyclo Guerilla for more bike lanes. It was a thriving time for City activists but ended up in a lot of ego-fights and underlying conflicts between activist groups that maybe wanted the same, but had a nuanced approach that resulted in conflicts. I was really saddened about this rivalry between people wanting to look for each other and better the world. Sometimes it became a toxic environment where people found it more important to be right then to care for his or her fellow activist. That is where my enthusiasm for classic activism stopped. But luckily for me there were lots of alternatives.\n \nPOC21 / Edgeryders\n \nIn the summer of 2015, one of my projects (V\u00e9lo M2) was selected for the 5-week innovation camp in an abandoned castle near Paris. I wasn\u2019t prepared at all for the mind-blowing experience that would impact the way I think and live from then on. POC21 was a temporary place where every day around 100 people lived and worked together around 13 projects. The symbiosis that occurred there was one of kind. I think the biggest reason of their success was the creation of an immediate trust between all participants. We were into it for the same narrative and will do it together. By creating a taskboard with everything that was needed to do to keep the machine rolling without taking account that everybody gave equal amount of energy it created another way of working. Not guild trapping you in doing it, but giving you the space for the things you wanted to do. Of course it wasn\u2019t always as perfect and I think the architects of the project had a lot of conflicts, but almost all the time it occurred in an open discussion. There was the space to doubt, to fail, to negotiate the coming or not of the president of France, \u2026\n\nHaving met really great people at POC21 I came in touch with Edgeryders, where I started writing occasionally for. While it wasn\u2019t at a first glance the most intuitive platform, I loved the vibe coming from the comments while writing pieces. No easy comments, but moments of thoughtful sharing. I was invited for LOTE4 and continued to engage into the conversation. The word \u2018conversation\u2019 is for me the best way to describe what Edgeryders is, a constant conversation with fellow humans about deeper subjects. I know how hard some of the Edgeryders core members fight for the organization, but what I always loved about the structure is the easy switcheroo between being active and passive in the organization. I curated an event around care at Huis VDH for them and learned much about the organization as about my own skills. Without any problem, I was able to switch to being a passive member again while feeling no pressure to do more or be more involved. That organic feel is something I really appreciate. I understand those core members are an important asset, but giving the opportunity for others to wander around inside the collective is a great way to care for our members.\n\nCIN / V\u00e9lo M2\n\nWhere the first example was a background introduction and the second a more or less ideal situation, the third kind of organizations are the one I search the most answers for. Civic Innovation Network is a platform where I\u2019m now an occasional \u2018scenarist\u2019 for and V\u00e9lo M2 is a project I created with a couple of engineers. Both have a massive potential, both are now connected through a possible fund I helped creating, but in both I can\u2019t find my ideal place as an individual. I asked myself multiple times why I wasn\u2019t able to fit the narrative. When for example I got more and more involved in CIN my anxieties where getting higher and less manageable. CIN is achieving great things, but every time I\u2019m hesitating in what my place is in it.   The demanded structure at V\u00e9lo M2 with weekly meetings and monthly working sessions made me feel trapped and again scared. And then the question occurred: in an environment where Open Source, collectiveness but also growth is a key feature is it the individual that needs to adapt towards the collective or is it the collective that has to be flexible towards each individual it encounters. For growing and likewise still learning entities it looks like it\u2019s important to create long-lasting mechanisms, structures that helps stabilize the organization for a fruitful future.\n\nBut then the ethical questions arise, what do we do with those that can\u2019t, or are less able to manage a structured, framed context and need the flexibility. Is it a task for the collective to look after them, to simply understand them, and loose maybe some momentum because of the lacking stability or is it the individual that needs to understand or made clear what he or he can\u2019t do? In the couple of years I\u2019m struggling with my anxieties I often chose the second one. For example at my main job at Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival it took me almost three years to create the right balance between creating my own agenda following my ups and downs, trying to explain that to my colleagues and knowing that in the two week period of the festival I need to fight ANY possible anxiety because of the fact that I manage 150 guests for that period of time. At Fermenthings, a shop I own with a friend, before starting I gave him one task that I would not work on from minute one: it was paperwork. I don\u2019t understand the logic of the bureaucracy and it simply blocks me to work on anything else. I know it would be a stumbling-block for the whole organisation. Thanks to a lot of attempts and fails I\u2019m starting to understand better what my role can be. I love to create, to enthusiasm people and structure vision, but I need organized and stable people around me to compensate my lack of consistency.\n \nI felt so often overwhelmed and helpless trying to understand myself. I would have loved to find people, feeling the same struggles or questions willing to create the right protocol, so maybe through this OpenCare Village festival we could open the discussion about care of the individual inside the collective. I didn\u2019t expect to write such a personal paper, and for those I made unease with it, I apologies. But my only hope through this is a better understanding of each others \u2018condition humain\u2019 and maybe we would find collective answers for the individuals through this mean.", "created_at": "2017-10-09 20:16:42.460715", "updated_at": "2017-10-10 08:32:33.420862", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1900, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 909.0, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3362, 3769, 4056, 4, 3613, 3367], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37974, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 7388, "post_number": 2, "raw": "this is my introduction for the infrastructure for autonomy, if somebody could help clean out the grammatical errors that would be great, ping @noemi", "created_at": "2017-10-09 20:18:01.039751", "updated_at": "2017-10-09 20:18:01.039751", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 68.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4056, 3613], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13178, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>thats important, but so are real live activities </b>\n\nYeah, we need a comprehensive communication platform for this sort of stuff: one which new non-geeky people can easily join and start using straight away.\n\nIf you give them alink to the edgeryders as it is now, it might take them ages.

It does seem the last resort now, with people hanging on as long as possible in their own homes, even if that means being on their own and struggling with shopping, cooking, etc.; less onus seems to be placed on the positives of being in a shared establishment with other people (company and activities, good facilties, cooking and cleaning taken care of, assistance on hand whenever needed, etc.) Is this reflective of our focus on youth and the \"invisibility\" of the elderly, our fear of aging and death nowadays,\u00a0marketing, the cult of the self and independence, or somesuch?\n\nProgramme description -: \"Care Homes - The care home business is heading for a crisis according to Evan Davis's guests in this edition of The Bottom Line.\n\nThe cost of providing care in this labour-intensive business has increased significantly because of the introduction of the National Living Wage. The fees paid by local authorities on behalf of poorer residents no longer cover the cost of providing accommodation, food and staffing. Care homes make up the shortfall by charging higher fees to privately funded residents. Social care analyst William Laing tells Evan Davis that private payers subsidise publicly funded residents by, on average, \u00a38000 per annum. But this is not an option in less affluent areas with a shortage of fee paying clients.\n\nJohn Ransford of the HC-One group provides care for mainly publicly funded residents.

Could be shorter depending on the exact address of the venue (@noemi ?). You can reach the water easily. Not sure if it's allowed, but we should ask if a demo is allowed (not the actual fishing). The distance is a problem: a one hour round trip doesn't fit the schedule. Public transport takes as long. Perhaps a few rental cars?

ALOT . I was at the anti \\#ACTA protest in Strasbourg. It was so touching, you're right there is something about people braving the cold and marching together, a transcendent sense of community that I think is something I have been missing. You see I tend to stay away from political displays of any kind, to some extent because I am quite sceptical of mainstream politics. To some extent its because I have the engineering bias:\u00a0 my kind of agitation is played out in trying to come up with alternatives that affect change simply because they are better. But even I am coming to the conclusion that avoiding \"politics\" is no longer a feasible alternative when we see attacks on our civil liberties pushed by vested interests that undermine our ability to even do that. The problem is that they are very motivated because they have a lot to lose, while the rest of us are only just beginning to realise what is at stake for us and hardly that.\n\nThe protest in Strasbourg had a strong turnout, but imho was not very creative or fun. Which with street protests, especially when it's about topics thqat people know little about, is important.

Whenever we are trying to market an event we set up a stall on the highest traffic area in the college, we play fun games, use lots of posters and sweets and we tell people on an individual basis, this has proven to be very effective because lots of people get to hear about the event and they tell their friends, word of mouth has been our best marketing tool.\n\nWe also use social media campaigns and we regularly run competitions, we try to be as interactive and personal with our followers and members as possible.\u00a0\n\nWe use posters and the other generic tools also.

One example of this was that we put our logo and website address on to hundreds of clothes pegs and we stuck them on people without them noticing :)\n\n\u00a0\n\nR\u00f3n\u00e1n.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-16 14:46:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.425942", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 217, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19531], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22496, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2796, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Cultural attractor</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf Pavlik</a>, I think Nico's video <em>is</em>\u00a0(almost) perfect, and we can get rid of the \"almost\" with the one static-text-on-screen for 10 seconds modification suggested below.

See the \"[Admin tasks for edgeryders.eu](/t/id/6647)\" manual at \"Tags for project content\". The idea is that we will eventually have a nice list, for example on the \"[Company \u2192 Our Work](/t/id/38)\" page, with links to the complete content of each project we did.\n\nFor that reason, all OpenCare content (including the one not meant for Open Ethnographer) should have the #project-opencare::tag tag. And all content should only have one `project-*` tag because it only belongs to one client project we do. So in this scheme it's not possible to introduce `project-opencare-oe-selection` either.\n\nProposal: I was thinking of introducing project-specific tag namespaces that can be used however people like (and give the assurance that mods and admins won't mess with them). They would start with the project name as prefix, and anything afterwards. So @amelia could use `opencare-extracontent` or similar to mark OpenCare content outside the OpenCare category that should be coded in Open Ethnographer. By including this in a tag group with `project-opencare` as parent tag, it is also ensured that nobody can use this tag outside of OpenCare content.\n\nIf you agree, could you update your instructions above accordingly?", "created_at": "2017-09-12 18:46:05.085559", "updated_at": "2018-05-23 11:40:42.668854", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 246, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 30.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62009, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11224, "post_number": 12, "raw": "## Malmo (English, Swedish): What does tech look like on a finite, post-climate change earth?\n\nWho is accountable for which results? @zelf is accountable to deliver sign-ups and documentation, has to book location and organise facilitation.

I'd be interested in hearing what people think about voting as used in groups in particular, but also on platforms such as EdgeRyders. I've had a number of discussion with people over the years on this topic, and I've tried my best to describe the main reasons why people tend to avoid voting in group work:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Voting is confrontational,</strong>\u00a0it can be used to coerce people who are in a minority, and encourages combative or aggressive dialogue.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Voting takes time,</strong> it is formal bureaucratic, and while in an ideal world we would consider it, it is faster for us simply to meet, discuss and decide together.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Voting is not needed,</strong> we come to an understanding by simply debating and talking it through as a group.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Voting does not result in the best result</strong>. You get a better result when people who are passionate speak up and make good arguments.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThere are also a number of background reasons that people give (often in confidence), when I\u2019ve discussed this topic with them. There is a perhaps surprisingly common apathy and even antagonism to democracy in general, and the focus of this target is often elected politicians, and the quality of the public debate which seems irrelevant to most peoples concerns. Voting is also associated with companies, and legal structures \u2013 which people tend to distrust.\n\nI've done my best to counter these arguments, in a little detail <a href=\"http://www.parliamentofthings.org/why-everyone-hates-voting/\">on my blog,</a> but I'd be interested to hear what people here think?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-21 15:07:24", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:53.621430", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61787, "user_id": 2567, "topic_id": 10326, "post_number": 47, "raw": "Meanwhile I'm going to create an event on our side with the info I gather from here. \nRegistration link will be the festival registration page, is that ok ?\n\nEdit : https://digityser.org/events/edgeryders-festival-workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them/", "created_at": "2019-10-21 09:24:30.465213", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 09:42:31.657668", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 57, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 34.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61452], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62481, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 10326, "post_number": 52, "raw": "Hi guys,\n\nI would like to join the workshop, but I'm not sure I qualify.

The main idea behind its development is that of enabling its use directly at people's homes, in order to allow intensive sessions directly in activities of daily living.\u00a0As such, it could be used in several scenarios, from rehab to assistance. The main differentiator wrt such scenarios would/could (mainly) be the user-interface.\n\nIn the simplest\u00a0case, the device could be programmed (by a physician, physiotherapist etc.) in order to mimic/repeat a predefined set of motions over and over again in order, for example, to avoid the undesired consequences of limbs immobilization (contractures, poor blood circulation etc).\n\nIn a rehab setting, for example post-stroke, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived by decoding user's intention via physiological signals (mainly EEG, EMG). In this case the basic idea would be to allow the user to complement or slowly re-gain control over his flaccid/weak arm and discontinue its use once the user does not need it any longer.\n\nIn an assistive setting, for example post spinal cord injury or in myopathies, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived as before or chosen from a simple interface (e.g. smartphone, joysticks etc.) in order to provide assistance-as-needed, whenever the user wears\u00a0the device.\n\nIn a case like the one you've mentioned the device could indeed be used, not to help but rather to (selectively) resist the movements. By customizing some parameters to the user's needs/residual abilities, one could enable\u00a0specific trainings in order to work on specific ranges of motions, torques, joints/muscles combinations etc. Such parameters/programs could be also updated by a physician, or dynamically (by the device itself) by inferring correlates of muscle-fatigue, achievable range of motions etc.\n\nIn all the previous scenarios, as specified by @Noemi, data related to the user's progress could be collected and analyzed, for the sake of monitoring and improving the therapy itself.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-22 17:34:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.113564", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 372, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8386], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60882, "user_id": 5185, "topic_id": 10621, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Jak dla mnie \u015bwietny pomys\u0142 do podyskutowania i poznania innego spojrzenia na nasz\u0105 Ojczyzn\u0119.

Often, policies and political approaches seem so far away from what anyone could really want, and many times it's appearances that count when you're talking about involvement, feeling a part of something, participation and inclusion. Isn't it possible though that there are so many conflicts of interest, different perspectives and angles on a matter that the resulting policy put into practice may be one of the best? If we can understand and see the reasoning and influences behind decisions we can find better ways to communicate and engage politically.\n\nI've started off in a very abstract way, so let's take a specific example: the closure of a local swimming pool. It's a good example because the replacement swimming baths I have in mind are already very popular and the upset caused by closing the original pool is already forgotten. At the time though, despite probably completely valid and well-balanced arguments for the closure, the closed-doors decision seemed dubious and dishonest simply because we were not in a position to understand it.\n\nI don't think it's enough to address the lack of influence or power of certain stakeholders or end-users (people who'd like access to a service etc.) There should be a means to express an individual's thoughts on factors with weighting on decisions which a simple transparency through open government fails to resolve.

The seminar took place in Messina, on the northeast tip of Sicily: mainland Italy was just three kilometers away, looming across the strait. It was interesting in and of itself, and it ties back nicely onto our work on the [Next Generation Internet](https://www.ngi.eu), which is just starting now. But what was most interesting was the place that hosted us, [Fondazione Horcynus Orca](http://www.fdcmessina.org/index.php/pag-sezione/fondazione-horcynus-orca/). The place felt... utopian. Built around the ruins of a 1st-century BCE Roman watchtower/temple, maintained by ex-inmates of the local mental asylum, meeting place of people in several businesses, from a local energy company to a beer manufacturer. Something was going on. So I asked.\n\nIt turns out Messina hosts an \"advanced social district\" (distretto sociale avanzato). In Italian, \"district\" carries the idea of production; a tightly integrated network of independent companies, competing on some arenas, cooperating in others ([industrial district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_district)), of which Horcynus Orca is only a piece, specializing in the arts. As I spoke to Gaetano Giunta, a physicist and member of the small group of friends who quit their jobs to start it all in the late 1990s, I heard him mention values similar to Edgeryders's own: freedom, happiness, beauty. Business and commerce are the weapon of choice, the main path that leads to being able to uphold them sustainably. \n\nI am only starting to study the district's fascinating history and organizational architecture, so I will not talk about this now. But I do want to note an investment model mentioned by Gaetano that struck me as super-clever.\n\nIn 2010, activity in Messina had reached critical mass. Gaetano and his group were able to attract a largish investment, that went into the startup capital of an Italian social economy vehicle called a [community foundation](http://www.fdcmessina.org) (fondazione di comunit\u00e0). At that point, they had the problem of investing the money so that this capital would result in a revenue stream for the new foundation to do its job. They did not want to invest in financial assets, as they thought this would betray their mission of developing the local social economy. What could they do? \n\nAs they studied the problem, they realized that Italy had launched a plan of incentives to build up capacity in renewable energy generation. This was, in fact, the Italian implementation of a EU program called [feed-in tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariff). Such program promised a long-term (20 years) subsidy to anyone installing solar panels or wind turbines. \n\nSo, they reached out to the community, and offered to partner up with basically everybody who asked: schools, hospitals, companies, small coops of households. Each partner would receive and steward a cluster of solar panels. The Foundation paid for the installation, and even let the partners keep the energy, to use or sell back to the grid. The Foundation itself gets to keep the subsidy. They ended up installing 2 MW of capacity. For doing all this, they spun off what they call an ESCO (Energy Social Company) called [Solidarity and Energy](http://www.fdcmessina.org/index.php/pag-sezione/esco/). The ESCO then proceeded to use the foothold gained in renewables to further green the local economy, by pushing for increasing the energy efficiency of the housing stocks, and even inventing [solar panels based on organic materials](http://www.fdcmessina.org/index.php/pag-sezione/fotovoltaico-organico-e-welfare-di-comunita/), like discarded oranges (!). They are low-efficiency, but super-cheap, and they come in colors (oranges pulp is bright red in Sicily!), so they have a lot of potential whenever designers are involved. \n\nNow, this is a *very* elegant move. In one go, they greened the economy; created a new local player who would further green it long-term; provided a tangible benefit for the local community; bought themselves a lot of goodwill; *and* turned a lump of \"dead\" money into a 20-years guaranteed revenue stream. Finance, as it should be! \n\nMy intention is now to spend a week or so in Messina, and really understand how they do it, also as inspiration for [the future Reef](/t/6239). I would love to share this experience with @noemi, @nadia, @matthias, @patrick_andrews,   @lasindias, @richdecibels, @phoebe... who else? \n\nI think I can swing hospitality for a few people, if I ask nicely and if we are ready to give back, for example organizing a small event on new co-operativism and post-capitalist enterprise.

In 1996 (or 95, I forget which year)  one of those people was Jeff Bezos.  The memorable quote from his talk was, \"we're going to obsess about our customers and make our competitors obsess about us.\"  Pretty accurate, even today.\n\nAt that same meeting, one of the groups at the Media Lab demonstrated the first iterations of collaborative filtering.  The idea was simply \"if you like these things and someone else also likes them, then other things they like could be of interest to you and vice-versa.\"  Bezos saw immediately the possibilities of this and Amazon was the first large scale practitioner of what is now a huge core component of today's commercial internet.\n\nThis is relevant to the free-with-ads model.

You play down your theoretical thinking, but your work may have long ranging consequences for the way we think about policy on commons. Most people think about this issue in terms of <em>tragedy</em>: how to avoid the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">Tragedy of the commons</a>? The implication is that, if you leave people alone, they will destroy, appropriate and exclude. So, we spend a great deal of energy ring-fencing, restricting, forbidding.\n\nIs this the right approach? Sometimes it will be. But other times, no. On the Internet, online community managers steer by little drops of wisdom like \"assume good faith\" and \"if you design your system for trolls, your users will be trolls\". It seems that, at least in this case, you can just leave open access and deal with abuse on a case by case basis. Criticalcity Upload happens not online, but on the street: and yet, the same dynamics seems to apply. People don't need to be controlled much: they actively care for the cities they live in, and they strive to improve them and protect them <em>as a community</em>.

By focusing on personal experiences with people who work in the industry, governance, policy and the media we are hoping to find new interesting angles on how people experience the internet today and how they see it developing in the future. We will also talk about the Edgeryders methodology and how SSNA and ethnography is informing the NGI ecosystem. \n\nI will be joined by @BlackForestBoi.

His plan is to create a artificial intelligence that will guide you to accomplish your goals, his team is currently working from different countries, he is at a point where he needs a good support to make his project real. Very promising\u201d\n\n**Adeeb**\n\n\u201cHe is very quiet person, working on different projects at the same time, counting on start ups to push his project further. He only shared with us his idea of an application where it gathers a database of refugees concerning their health, environment, houses, family status\u2026 so NGOs, companies, donators will know how to help. His goal is to help everyone and not only the refugees as it is not a permanent situation\u201d\n\nAdeeb talked about his experiences around the difficulties in trying to run a project to teach people different kinds of  skills. How his project had to adapt to this and the lessons he has learned e.g. that he had started out t he came across many challenges. One had to do with attitudes: At first he tried to interest people in taking Moocs, or watching videos and then discussing/working in study groups. People weren\u2019t up for it. He also tried to teach people (tech/professional skills) with the intentions that they would then teach others. But every time he would try to teach people one skill, he would discover they would be lacking other skills needed to e.g that people were struggling to even use computers. So now he has settled for teaching people life skills e.g. time management and fitting into professional environments.\n\n_his project :_\n\nPlatform on the web and apps to improve Communication between NGOS/companies/organization and Refugees (potentially for everyone).\nWe work on providing informations and studies and statistics about refugees and about the companies (NGOs organization), so people can find what they need through us.\nOur database will be about education-health-family status-work-statistics OF refugees. All help done by NGOs or any company will also be noted in our database, to be able reach everyone.\n\n_What we need for the time being :_\n\n-              Road map : to be able to make a better plan,  strategy plan, to know how to take our steps. And to to understand the steps already done.\n-              Team: we need a stronger team. We are only two persons behind it so we need more.\n-              Budget: consultancy, and accounting studies.\n\n\nHas a lot of difficulty travelling e.g. to do pitches, because of his Syrian passport. He has had to ask his partners who can travel to participate in pitching competitions  instead of him. Every government assumes that a Syrian visa applicant will apply for asylum. ..\n\nHe mentioned having had a similar idea to openvillage at some point\u2026.?\n\n**Khaleel**\n\n\u201cKhaleel is a writer, wants to find a community away from his town so he could have the freedom to write his ideas that don't match any of the people or family around him. He is feeling like an alien in his world, and needs to come back to LIFE\u201d\n\n\u201cOpenVillage will make me have more friends around the world, I would be able to learn more about their culture, get inspired by them and share personal stories of my own background with them.

Founded 10 years ago it\u2019s a model for panarchy or polyanarchy that enabled thousands of people across the region and the world to live in a different way. Dual currencies, building new networks and the culture of the Catalonian people are some of the reasons why it worked so well.\n\n**\u201cEscaping a centralized economic approach\u201d**\n\nJoel explains that with panarchy - or poly anarchy - you don\u2019t have to move to join a new system, you can govern yourself in different ways, from where you live. In the past people associated communism with Russia and capitalism with the US.\n\n\u201cWhy not in the same country, could we have different ways that every citizen voluntarily aggregates this kind of government?\u201d Joel asks.\n\n## How do you go about adopting this model?\n\n**1. Building networks**\n\nThe cooperative had 3000 associates but the collective was producing things that were distributed to markets and shops and possibly reached tens of thousands of people - some not fully realising about the network.\n\nAlberto makes the point that with the CIC, it didn't try to replace the state but acted as a separate structure: \u201cIf you study the CIC it's the opposite of a monolith. Many things are small that are connected to each other in a web by way of relationship, trade, economics trade, ownership, financial, ideology etc. ## Instead of scale it has depth.\u201d\n\n**2. Brains behind the operation**\n\n@Joel explains that Enric Duran, activist and author, was the major person behind the project and many people were attracted to his ideas.\n\n\u201cIt was an experiment and practice. (We said) Let\u2019s not waste much time thinking or discussing, but let\u2019s do it once we have a discussion.\u201d\n\nD\u00eddac Sanchez-Costa was another who helped with the coordination of the movement.\n\n**3. Consensus-led approach**\n\n\u201cWe have known that everything before has failed\u2026\u201d @Joel says. From the outset he explains that the group decided they wanted decisions to be made upon consensus rather than voting majorities.\n\n# **What was it like to live in the Catalan Cooperative?**\n\nJoel says in villages, towns and the city of Barcelona people lived within this system:\n\n\u201cThe feeling was deep happiness, because you are not isolated as a little community, always seeing the same people. Part of the physical spaces of the CIC, twice a month we had general meetings - in Barcelona and and others in the north, east and west.\n\n\u201cThat was three days a month and felt like a holiday weekend. We had our concert at night and good food almost for free at very cheap prices with social currency. For example 2 eco or a meal. It could be the equivalent of 2 euro and you are eating the most wonderful ecological food.\n\n\u201cThe feeling was freedom and we connected much more. Our surroundings came (to feel) like a general family. It felt like a tribe a little. It felt like something else. We were meeting to talk about our reality and friendship but at the same time it felt like there was friendship.\u201d\n\n**Dual currency enabled this**\n\n## \u201cOwnership of goods felt different than when you buy with currency\u201d\n\n\u201c**Eco**\u201d - local currency used by Catalan Integral Cooperative\n\nJoel explains it changed the way you think about money. So you can say to someone \u2018I cannot give you something immediately\u2019. It happened in Mesopotamia (where it\u2019s believed the world\u2019s first civilisation emerged).\n\n**Dual currency allows you to withstand economic shock**\n\n@Joel says: **\u201cIn a crisis there is no money flow but everyone has the same needs and the same capabilities of production as the day before- why does that happen? Because we are waiting for the bank, for private banking.\u201d**\n\n\u201cThis is cyclical, and I have read many economists who tell you clearly this is artificially manipulated. So if we have a counter cyclical currency, when they remove the money from the market we can use that. We don\u2019t need to have one, we can have several because one way of (using) money could be a social currency - we have fantastic tools like this community exchange system (CES) created in South Africa by some. There are other ways of money in economies - it could be gift economies, exchange or cryptocurrencies. We are already decentralising when we moved to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOther forms of currency used:\n\n1. Gift economy (I don\u2019t want to be your consumer I want to be your friend)\n2. Exchange\n3. Social currency\n4. An ethical cryptocurrency (fair coins)\n5. Not ethical cryptocurrency\n6. Euros\n\n\"They have found it very useful because when you spend echoes you can save euros. \u2026 with echoes it\u2019s a 20 - 30% level of acceptance. For me, I found it gave me a lot of freedom. Others felt like they were punished because they felt like they had to use their echoes,\" Joel says.\n\n\"The best is to do everything and use all the economies at the same time, gift barter exchange, echoes, euros, fair coins and even bitcoins.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin and euros are very good for community economies, for example, we want to make a new building, we want to buy things from the market, decapitalise them and sell them in echoes inside  our core networks\"\n\n@Alberto makes the point that in **Sardinia Sardex** is used.\n\n\u201cIt is backed by the euro, so one equals a euro but you can only spend local. Therefore, if you are accepting it for your business you can only spend locally. So what they are trying to do is increase the local dimension and keep the money in the local economy.\u201d\n\nTax to the central government prevents businesses from fully adopting Sardex.\n\nLater on, **the Liberex** currency, used in Emilia-Romagna region of Italy is spoken about.\n\n## Where do we go from here?\n\n@Joel: \u201cWe should, not to replicate exactly what the CIC did, but we should gather and find, what and how people would like to live\u201d\n\n**\u201cIt has to be spread to the world and it has to be shared.\u201d**\n\n## Issues raised during the discussion:\n\nComment below if you have any thoughts on the following:\n\nAre there elements of indigenous societies that can give inspiration to other panarchy models?\n\nHow do you incorporate modern healthcare into a society like this, when you approach big problems from a local lens?", "created_at": "2020-11-13 11:29:50.336865", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 16:15:50.748782", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1106, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 137.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86805, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14804, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-11-13 11:38:43.455793", "updated_at": "2020-11-13 11:38:43.455793", "deleted_at": "2020-11-13 20:56:40.808778", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37042, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7193, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-09-26 20:38:54.064232", "updated_at": "2017-09-26 20:38:54.064232", "deleted_at": "2018-03-09 17:02:48.553172", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9885, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1329, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>\"Peace will not come from the sky\"</b>\n\nI find you particularly courageous and benevolant, to spend your thoughts and energy to try to find solutions to end conflicts.\n\nWar mentality is blinded by fear.

But it is not easy to get out of the war mentality, once a mind is infected by it.\n\nIt is the same situation for any negative or discursive thoughts, but war mentality stands on the extreme. For instance, politicians in the Shadow (of leadership) cannot easily get out of their mentality.\n\nEven anti-war protests can inflame the war mentality by inciting more stubbornness from the other side. I did not venture as far as becoming a peace activist, but I noticed that activism in favor of open government can often cause politicians and government leaders to lock themselves even further into risk aversion.\n\nWars would decline if peace became a social reality.

I recommend it to anyone who wants the long view.  Good website too - no need for paper if you don't want it.  So that is what the top of the heap looks like where the best writers get paid well.

Means, how are structured data communicated from Discourse to the webkit?\n\nThe one thing that (in my view) is not acceptable on the longer term is the ad-hoc use of Discourse tags to represent structured data. This was done at some point for the dates of events (but for that, the calendar plugin we have here on Discourse is the preferable solution).\n\nUndocumented ad-hoc tags that somehow influence software function are just a messy way to do things. Anyone cleaning up tags will certainly break things that way. At the minimum, these tags would have to be documented [here](/t/-/6647#heading--3-3) in our Discourse Admin Manual. And, they would have to use a common prefix like `webcontent-*`. Even then, more than one or two such tags per topic will appear as messy in the Discourse user interface (though there are CSS ways to hide them).\n\ntl;dr: If there are better ways than tags to encode structured information for use by the webkit, please use better ways.

Which didn't feel this way to me in Matera case, or at least in relationship with Comitato MT2019 folks during and after pilot session.\n\nI see a lot of <strong>opportunities for improvements</strong> in a procedure where we hand over things. We could make very clear our hand over conditions, including a checklist for when we feel comfortable to move on without worrying about future of an asset, into stewarding which we've put our time, energy and resources. So for example in this case we could have put requirement of something like <em>installing motion sensors</em> in\u00a0Palazzo del Casal and written commitment from someone to take responsibility to react when they get triggered. (please read it as just one of many possible/alternative conditions!)\n\nAnyways, I would propose not to continue this conversation any further on this post (which focuses on our public transit dev sprint) to prevent hijacking it. If someone would like to continue discussing this Failed Stewardship topic - PLEASE CREATE NEW DEDICATED POST/THREAD - Thank you!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-15 07:10:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.262860", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27148], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51437, "user_id": 4448, "topic_id": 9528, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Thanks for the questions Noemi!\n\nThere are reasons at all scales; most importantly for me, is that this concept aligns with my own dreams of holding space for conversations which matter, as I'm a geek for the emergence in group intelligence and have been honing my craft of hosting generative conversations as an art form of itself.\nMy work (in maori 'mahi' which also means life mission) is to grow serendipity through thriving networks at the glocal level.

So can this attitude taken toward the pandemic be applied to the ecological crisis that also faces us?\n\nAs society strives to rebuild itself towards a post-Covid world, creating green economies is not only mandatory, but an opportunity. At Edgeryders we have been asking ourselves, and each other, how we can possibly create new systems that address social issues and are more sustainable.\n\nAn excellent example of how these systems can be built, is that of the district of Messina in Sicily, Italy. [We held a webinar recently with one of the co-founders of Fondazione Communit\u00e0 di Messina](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14443), which reintegrated patients at a local mental health institute back into society and used the money the government normally pays to keep them there to buy solar panels and transform a community that was\n\nThe initiative benefited the local community, because it reduced the consumption of fossil fuels, provided further funding from the green subsidies for the organisation to invest in other projects, successfully reintegrated vulnerable cities back into the community, and spawned several new businesses. It highlights that the transition to a green economy is part of a much larger picture.\n\nFondazione Communit\u00e0 di Messina has been pioneering in four ways when it comes to the systems it has built:\n\n1. It\u2019s attitude to relational goods (understanding there is a human side to physical goods)\n2. Chooses stocks over cash flows (ie invests in solar panels rather than obtaining grants which come and go)\n3. It operates as a malleable system that reacts and adapts to change rather than a network that solves one problem\n4. Operates a Dyson\u2019s sphere model that gives prosperity to every member of the system\n\nFor a more detailed read on that see [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14486).\n\nEdgeryder co-founder Matthias has put together various blueprints for how [cities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-autarky-system-for-cities/9141) and [rural regions](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-rural-living/7566) can adopt self-sustainable policies and infrastructure. Here's further reading on [what the future of urban living](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-urban-living/12097) can look like.\n\nThe past few months have also showed us that a different way of work is achievable - one that lessens commutes, exhaust fumes and allows workers more control of their lives, if implemented correctly.\n\nWhen not done correctly, however, work can seep into your daily lives and take over, leading to burnout. On top of that, many countries are now facing their second waves of cases, and some of us are balancing family needs and work life while daycare and schools are closed.\n\nThe co-working sector could address some of these concerns. With one of our [co-founders asking how spaces could make life easier for freelancers](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14504). We have also discussed on the forum that the sector could be an [answer to the challenges surrounding childcare](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14331) at a recent webinar that looked at co-working\u2019s recovery.\n\n**Don't forget...**\n\nOur conversations aren\u2019t only happening on the platform, some upcoming events that are also discussing what our future may look like:\n\n* 8/10: [Citizen engagement and regional policies ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-session-on-citizen-engagement-in-euregionsweek-sneak-peek/14489)in the transition to a viable low carbon economy.\n* 16/10 : [Info session about our new World Building academy! ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14481)We are launching a residency in collaboration with EIT Climate Kic as part of our Scifi Economics Lab.\n* 29/10: [How can we work together to support localisation of food?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-event-invitation-sustainable-agriculture-and-food/14493) A webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond.\n\n**Please leave a comment below if you have any thoughts on how we can transition our economy to a green and better future.**\n\n---\nImage by Note Thanun  on Unsplash", "created_at": "2020-10-02 14:56:17.595178", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 08:37:00.373690", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 735, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 92.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 2915, 8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61134, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 11076, "post_number": 2, "raw": "D\u00edky za sd\u00edlen\u00ed t\u00e9hle osobn\u00ed zku\u0161enosti.

For those who don't know you, you've been following Edgeryders ever since the beginning. Here are some thoughts after reading your story, which in my opinion raises so many issues:\n\n1) I literally had to google search images of this techno fashion, I had seen something like this before but wasn;t familiar with the name. wow, can't imagine how it's like to study it ! Definitely hand me in some readings when you have a chance, or maybe your thesis when it's done :)\n\n2) What is this PaEI model you couldn't consciously use back in Berlin, but intuitively did so? What does it mean?\n\n3) The educational model you are talking about: coupling theory with practical knowledge in a way that makes sense depending on the field of study or learning patterns, I think generally it is quite spread. That is, in theory it should work like this, but most often it is not adapted to unique learning settings. For example, in Romania you do have internships coupled with theory, but somehow there's not much connection between the two, meaning that students very often end up doing the internship but only for the paper proof, and work in activities remotely connected to what they study. Most of the time you have to find opportunities yourself, the school doesn't really care what you do as long as you get a proof.. The problem is that there's no evaluation process, nobody asks you what you learned, or to talk about it with school mates, so as to internalize and critically assess your learning process. You do it, you get the paper/ credits, you have 1 more line added to your resume and that's it. Of course, this is general, not all the time things happen like this, but in my experience yes.\n\nThanks again and stick around, ok?\n\nNoemi\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-20 15:18:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.719332", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 364, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7333, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1344, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Which side do we fall on?</b>\n\nThanks for sharing, Elisabetta! \"Research and activism\" is a nice, clear line.

Quatre personnes (trois marocains, un fran\u00e7ais) \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes. Apr\u00e8s une introduction aux diff\u00e9rentes dynamiques de EdgeRyders par Nadia, les pr\u00e9sentations via le choix personnel de trois th\u00e9matiques purent s'effectuer, accompagn\u00e9es d'un petit th\u00e9.\nA noter que pour la majorit\u00e9 des participants, le travail et les process de EdgeRyders n'\u00e9taient pas ou peu connus. Les discussions se sont concentr\u00e9es sur le parcours des participants.\n\n\n**Maha**\n\nApr\u00e8s cinq mois dans la vie professionnelle (dans une entreprise qui fournit des services SAP), elle a surtout retenu que \u201cle contact est primordial pour r\u00e9ussir \u00bb. Etre en bonne relation avec ses coll\u00e8gues lui permettra, selon elle, de progresser dans sa carri\u00e8re. Comment garder ce r\u00e9seau pro, comment se comporter au travail. Elle a \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 que les coll\u00e8gues qui jouant les trop proches avec les sup\u00e9rieurs, qui parlent avec eux m\u00eame en n'ayant rien \u00e0 dire, se voit offrir plus d'opportunit\u00e9s etc... Mais sa personnalit\u00e9 n'est pas comme \u00e7a.\n\nUn des th\u00e8mes qui l'anime le plus : ll'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une l'\u00e9ducation. Elle pointe le fait que les plus riches ont droits aux \u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures. A chaque passage devant un bidonville, elle se questionne : pourquoi ne pas donner des cours suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 ces jeunes ? Quand Maha est entr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9, elle s'est rapproch\u00e9 d'une structure qui faisait du parrainage avec des orphelins. Elle a donn\u00e9 des cours mais a rencontr\u00e9 assez vite un probl\u00e8me : son planning d\u2019examens, des d\u00e9placements ne lui permettait pas d\u2019effectuer sa tache \u00e0 100%.\n\nQuelles solutions? Elle voudrait mettre en place un calendrier collaboratif afin d'assurer la continuit\u00e9 de l'enseignement compl\u00e9mentaire, pourvu d'un mod\u00e9rateur. Ce calendrier Adaptable aux collgues de travail.   Id\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er un planning g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour assurer la continuit\u00e9 de l\u2019enseignement suppl\u00e9mentaire, que ce soit en arabe, en math\u00e9matiques, en fran\u00e7ais\u2026\n\n**Akram**\n\nAkram est dans sa derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d'\u00e9tude d'ing\u00e9nieur \u00e0 Rabat. Pendant son temps libre il fait des vid\u00e9os et du motion design, participe \u00e0 des Hackhathon. Il est en recherche active de nouveaux projets et aimerait apporter ses comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 de bonnes choses. Il est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9veloppement perosnnel, qui repr\u00e9sente beaucoup pour lui : affuter son esprits critique, \u00eatre curieux, assister \u00e0 des d\u00e9bats, participer \u00e0 des workshops comme Edgeryders :).\n\nLe d\u00e9veloppement personnel est \u00ab un entra\u00eenement quotidien \u00bb : s'inscrire \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents groupes sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux afin d'\u00eatre en veille sur ce qu'il peut se passer autour de lui. Il s'int\u00e9resse par exemple en ce moment \u00e0\u00e0 l'a m\u00e9ditation, au yoga (\u00ab tr\u00e8s en vogue en ce moment \u00bb). Il aime penser et voir comment les gens arrivent \u00e0 leurs buts.\n\nLe relationnel est pour lui tr\u00e8s important : on apprend \u00e0 travers sa famille et ses amis. Il faut s'entourer des gens qui connaissent pour apprendre. Et ensuite se baser sur le relationnel win-win.\n\n**Mohamed**\n\nMohamed est un ancien fonctionnaire qui a quitt\u00e9 son poste sans un plan b, principalement car il n'en pouvait plus des conditions et de la dynamiques de travail. A chaque nouveau mandat d'un politicien, il avait plus l'impression de retours en arri\u00e8re que de volont\u00e9s de progr\u00e8s, de changements (a rejoint Maha sur les lacunes du syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif marocain). Il avait besoin de sortir de sa zone de confort, de cr\u00e9er un portefeuille de projets pour passer du passif \u00e0 l'actif.\n\nDevenant entrepreneur, mettant en avant les bienfaits de l'autonomie, de l'ind\u00e9pendance et de la libert\u00e9, (actuellement sur des questions environnementales / de sant\u00e9 publique, via la cr\u00e9ation d'un r\u00e9seau public de poubelles connect\u00e9s ), il avait fond\u00e9 une association g\u00e9rant un espace de co-working \u00e0 Casablanca, projet qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9 au bout de quelque temps par le manque de participants.\n\nIl y a pourtant un v\u00e9ritable besoin de cr\u00e9er ces espaces o\u00f9 des jeunes gens avec de l'or et du temps dans les mains pourraient essayer, construire, tester, produire des choses. Mais pour le moment, les espaces de coworking \u00e0 Rabat peuvent charger jusqu'\u00e0 200USD par mois...\n\n**Simon** @SyMorin \n\nSimon est un ancien journaliste et producteur radio, ayant principalement travaill\u00e9 dans les milieux associatifs. Il en a connu les avantages et les limites : les diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les \u00e9conomiques, surtout dans le secteur des m\u00e9dias, sont tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9caires, et il a utilis\u00e9 beaucoup d'\u00e9nergie, voire trop.\n\nIl est aujourd'hui au Maroc (depuis fin ao\u00fbt), et voit \u00e7a comme une nouvelle \u00e9tape : comment apprendre de ses qualit\u00e9s, de ses \u00e9checs, dans la mise en place de projets de production (ce qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, mettre en place les meilleurs conditions de travail \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d'un projets). Il a besoin de faire le tri dans ses diff\u00e9rentes envies (toujours faire du journalisme, de la musique, de la cuisine, etc etc .. ?)\n\nIl croit beaucoup au temps libre, que l'apprentissage prend du temps. \u00ab La d\u00e9couverte prend du temps, il ne faut pas l'oublier \u00bb, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de ne pas griller les \u00e9tapes.

The people in France think that I am from Paris, because I have an undefined French accent. And the people from home, they never can identify to me, because I have this undefined international French accent. I must have turned into a real global citizen :)\n\nWe haven't seen many mission reports from Russian citizens so far.

I think I can see what he sees: social reality in terms of emergence, i.e. many individual agents that, by interacting with each other, give rise to higher-level phenomena (\"the market\", \"globalization\", \"the crisis\"). It is a fascinating way to see the word, because it plays down individual contributions of leaders (nice side effect: it disposes of conspiracy theories) while at the same time killing the \"story as clockwork\" vision that is so annoying on 19th century thinkers like Marx. There is no clockwork, just emergence from interaction.\n\nMy experience is that, once you see the world in these terms, it becomes impossible to unsee emergence. Just ask Kevin.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-03 09:30:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.789344", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 130, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1400, "user_id": 760, "topic_id": 1367, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI believe in today\u2019s world, and especially for a European, foreign languages are essential. Many would agree, but too often we only see languages as a mean for communication or better opportunities in the labour market. While this aspect is indeed relevant, I believe that studying foreign languages gives you a much better insight into another culture and thus the ability to see the world from a different perspective and keep an open-minded attitude.\u00a0\n\nMany countries do fail to offer sufficient opportunities for children and young people schools should offer another foreign language beyond English from the start and throughout high school. When high school offers different tracks, all tracks should have access to languages even if as an afterschool activity.\u00a0\n\nAnother central aspect is the lack of work experience of the youth in some countries. When they graduate high school, most Americans and many kids in the Anglo-Saxon world more in general have been part of the labour market with temporary part time jobs. This allows them to develop at an early age those general skills necessary to succeed. Moreover, younger students often intern in businesses and volunteer organizations before entering university. That constitutes an enrichment opportunity for teenagers and can aid them in selecting their educational path, especially in a system in which we select our major when entering university.\n\nPersonally, I was able to access similar opportunities through volunteering. It has given me many chances to grow, also helping fellow students or children in the process. Moreover, when it\u2019s a long-term commitment, you are able to learn a large set of skills as your responsibilities change over time, and also have \u201cwork experience\u201d in fields and tasks that often would rarely be covered by an official internship.\n\nSchools could also play an important role, working closely with local associations they can better direct students where opportunities in line with their interests are, creating a more active community and giving kids a chance to prove themselves, feel passionate about a cause or help people in need.\n\nIncentives should be put in to place to encourage students to take up these opportunities, also building on programs already into place, giving preferential treatment to students that enriched\u00a0their education through languages and volunteer experiences.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-03 10:09:59", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 09:26:51.455190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 264, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 231, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/engineering_at_cambridge_at_flickr.jpg\" title=\"Photo by engineering at Cambridge at flickr.com\">\n\nDo something to make yourself or your community more resilient, and then tell us about it!\n\nThings you might want to try:\n\n* Learn a resilience skill \u2013 _take a first aid course, or learn to repair a bicycle_\n\n* Make something in your life more resilient \u2013 _solar-charge your cellphone, get involved in a local resilience initiative_\n\n* Learn about local risks \u2013 _find and read the local emergency management plans for your area, and describe how you\u2019d respond in those scenarios_\n\n* Make a 72 hour kit \u2013 _[lots of agencies](http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit) recommend that people be ready to stand on their own feet for a few days after an earthquake or similar disruption_\n\nBe sure to write up why the activity you chose was right for you, and how you selected it from the other choices you had.

So we grew up with those . and 3. of course, the Internet. \u00a0This is Romania.. from what I see Hungary is nothing like that, so maybe not all Eastern Europe or Europe for that matter.\n\nAlso with finding work, aside from menial jobs, there is no job offer NOT requiring a second, well spoken language.. even if you're not actually using it if you get the job.. but it's something that's the common sense rule.\n\nWhere did you study? I looked up your Edgeryders profile but it is empty :-( \u00a0When you have the time I'd be curious to read a Share your Ryde report here, that would add context!\n\nLovely to read you,\n\nnoemi\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-04 07:21:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.155025", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61622, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10810, "post_number": 18, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:17, topic:10810\"]\n@ilaria, could you please get us the [Bespoke Illustration](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ri3m2cuPCCzuIrKQlGdTDa6_YDSI75MD) in as high a resolution as available?

If nobody else has a more urgent one, I\u2019d want this: an extended version of the [Bespoke Illustration](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ri3m2cuPCCzuIrKQlGdTDa6_YDSI75MD), in as high a resolution as possible, where the illustration is extended vertically at the top so that it ends in an area that has a single whiteish-blue color left-to-right. Basically a whiteish sky of a single color at the very top, left to right. The color should be well suitable to read dark text placed on top. Aspect ratio is not important for this, just adding it to the top of the existing illustration is fine. I need that when placing it at the bottom of a content page so that I can create a smooth transition to the background color of that page. I can do it myself, but if nobody else has a more important change request, Lorenzo can do it.\n[/quote]\n\nI ask for it. \n\nTalking about graphics: Lorenzo explained me that he gives us the bespoke illustration at high high resolution in jpg format, which is not modifiable in terms of \"changing the picture he designed\", but we can crop it, add logos, change the copy. Also, he gives us the PSD (Photoshop modifiable files) of all the digital assets he produces and the vectorial files of all the assets for printing materials he's doing. It is literally everything he has, it's all the designing process. \n\nThe reason of having a jpg format is that this is the format for this kind of complex, big illustrations, which are composed by vectorial and pixel graphics. What you proposed - svg format - is used for icon, logos and small images because with that format you can enlarge them, but with this illustration it's pointless.  \n\nThis is the what he wrote me:\n> As discussed yesterday via WA, and as stated in the contract, at the end of the project and after the payment is confirmed, I will also send EdgeRyders all the source files for these assets. \n> \n> This will include the PSD files of the digital assets, and any AI/PDF file created for any printed material (yet to be produced). \n> \n> With these files ER will be able to modify/change/reuse them, changing or adding any detail within them; save the illustrations, which are of course one single layer and can not be modified: only cropped at different sizes. \n> \n> The illustrations will be transferred as single JPG files, at high resolution; ready to be re-used for both digital and printed materials.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:17, topic:10810\"]\n**Enabling the multi-lingual features.** Once the translations are ready.

On my very first job after university I met a man named Paolo, who went on to become my best friend. This man has a very refreshing, independent way of thinking, and he enjoyed nuking my preconceptions. One thing he liked to say is that it is much easier to find employment in a very narrow, ultraspecialized area than\u00a0 in a very broad and defined one.\n\nMy friend's thinking has had a lot of influence on the way I looked for work ever since. I try to be very specific: \"I want to develop industrial policies for the music industry to maximize its beneficial impact on regional development\". \"I am an advocate of open government, skilled at designing online and offline collaborative environments for citizens to cooperate contrsuctively with institutions.\" I emphasize activities, not skills, so that I don't have to say \"I have a degree in this, a master in that, I have worked in this and that other areas, find me something to do\".\n\nI realize that this does not solve the problem of structured recruitment: in fact, I got nost of my jobs through informal recruitment procedures (I played this mission too - see <a href=\"/t/two-fails-one-partial-win-in-general-not-worth-it/1252\">here </a>- , and I, like you, am skeptical). But hey, I cannot influence the way recruiters work; what I can do is control my own angle of the interaction.\n\nInterestingly, another Edgeryder called Marco - also a foreigner in Scotland - has painted a much more optimistic picture of the labor market in the UK (see <a href=\"/t/ok-this-is-me/1487\">here</a>, also the comments - maybe you want to add to that discussion?).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-04 08:47:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.457559", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 306, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60946, "user_id": 4793, "topic_id": 11038, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Hi @matthias, many thanks!\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:8, topic:11038\"]\nDo you propose that doing so should show the annotations not just of the parent code, but of the parent code and its sub-codes?\n[/quote]\n\nYES!

[www.coactlab.org](http://www.coactlab.org/)\n\nWe wanted to inform the Edgeryder community regarding an upcoming forest-related incubation program to find solutions to protect and regenerate our forests.\n\nCOACT works with early-stage, environmentally focussed technology projects & companies to grow their potential into actual impact. Unlike typical incubators, our objective is to maximise this positive impact rather than profit. We are young, idealistic, and deeply driven towards these ends. \n\nPlease find details about the upcoming program below: \n\nWe would be extremely grateful if you can share with your networks to help us find potential participants to join us. \n\n\n**Forest Protections &amp; Regeneration Incubation**\n\n\nIn December, we are launching our second phase, in which we will incubate two companies or projects working towards Forest Protection &amp; Regeneration. Both projects will come to live and work from the Valldaura campus 20 minutes outside of Barcelona in Spain from December to mid February 2020. \n\nHere they will have access to the Green Fab Lab (digital fabrication and prototyping facilities), a traditional wood shop (carpentry machines and tools), a micro permaculture farm, and 130 hectares of surrounding forest. Also included are food, accomodation and more general workspace.\n\nWe are currently in talks with a [project named Dronecoria](http://dronecoria.org/en/main/), who have designed a system of open source flying drones to distribute seeds and replant forests from the air. We are currently on the lookout for other projects aligned with the objectives of Forest Protection &amp; Regeneration.\n\nWe thought that many members of this community may be well placed to know of early stage technology projects or companies in this area. If this is the case, we would be delighted to hear from you indicating the projects and people behind them. \n\nA few things to be aware of in their criteria:\n\n* They should be early stage and able to benefit from the facilities &amp; services we provide.\n* They should be ideally european based, though we would likely make exceptions for an amazing project further afield.\n* They should be willing and able to commit to the incubator for the duration, with a 2 week break over Christmas and New Years.\n* They should be open to being filmed and document their work (our program is probably not appropriate for closed, traditionally corporate-style companies or projects).\n* The attendees will need to be capped at 2 people per team", "created_at": "2019-10-21 07:52:46.177550", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 10:24:48.235150", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 410, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 118.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4934, 4667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12051, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1369, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Women and children remain fragile, spreading to families</b>\n\nI am not aware that it is required to write in a CV if a person is parent or not.

In the informal PIKPA camp in Lesvos for example, refugees create beautiful, colourful bags from discarded, life-jacket materials and are also planning to distribute them abroad.\n\nThere is many hopeful examples of such great initiatives in Greece and other countries and I am sure they will multiply as refugees are settling for a longer-time period in their new living places.\n\nWhat seems to be important right now, in order to make all this effort more meaningful and useful, is to move further from just providing for the basic needs to create structures of solidarity and cooperation that can provide more sustainable solutions and allow people to take care of themselves and feel empowered. This is a big challenge that lies ahead but we should start thinking this way if we want to make a real change to both their lives and ours.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-15 14:12:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:29.764050", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 262, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1941, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1908, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Since June when we launched the first invitation to Living on the Edge at unMonastery Matera, over 100 people across Europe and beyond have said to attend, as by <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/whos-coming-table\">this list</a>.\u00a0No surprises so far!\u00a0<span>Since registration is a rather easy process, anyone who has at least once considered coming is on the list.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>As we expect the number\u00a0to keep growing,\u00a0at the same time we need to develop a realistic expectation as to\u00a0</span><strong style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\">who is really coming. </strong>This is important for organisational purposes: to adjust the number of conference venues (unMonastery is hardly enough for everyone) and have time to book more space if needed; to estimate how much food we need; to organise the welcoming of everyone and make sure there's enough volunteers to help people reach Matera if\u00a0needed etc.\u00a0\n\nThis task is dated <strong>September 25th,</strong> that's when we start ringing the alarm, as Alberto has put it.

Countries with different cultures but meeting the same challenges: Reduction of the unemployment rate, economic development and more equality between the different regions of the country. The striking resemblance of young people in their countries is their big ambition and determination to change the reality of their country and contribute actively to its economic development..\n\nIn the 7 workshops we conducted in the region where we adopted methodologies specifically designed to help participants design their professional projects, we were able to identify the following three issues:\n\n* Companies recruit mainly experienced profiles, making access to the job market difficult for juniors and young graduates \n* Business creation / entrepreneurship has been presented to its young people as an alternative to unemployment however bureaucracy and lack of resources prevent some from embarking on the entrepreneurial adventure\n* The environment and working conditions in local businesses do not stimulate the creativity of its young talents, some of them seriously think about leaving their jobs.\n\nTo provide an alternative that meets the needs of the majority of the participants, we have integrated the OpenVillage academy, a new component of the large OpenVillage project. The academy offers a three-month period which allows young people to develop their talents by working on existing open source projects lead by more experienced, entrepreneurial, peers. This means they develop hard and soft skills by building meaningful things in a supportive and multicultural environment,  while supporting one another to move for good projects forward.\n\n In addition to the practical part of the internship that will be provided by the project leader (Edgeryders Community Entrepreneur) and his / her team, the OpenVillage Academy offers participants workshops and activities to strengthen their skills to make them more employable in the labor market. At the end of his / her course at the open village, a certificate validating the participant's personal qualities, aptitudes, skills and professional know-how will be awarded.\n\n\n**How to get yourself or your project in the OpenVillage Academy:**\n\n1.

I always think I have so much more to learn.\u00a0\n\nTeaching: I did two teacher training qualifications but still find it's one of the most difficult things to do. I've realised it's about nurturing, and that has made it easier.\u00a0\n\nThe creative skills: I've learned writing on some holiday courses but now I don't need so much teaching, more that I need time, mentoring and encouragement from others (for example, Pat Kane is my 'affinity partner' for writing my book). Photography: I did some holiday courses but have slightly dried up and don't push myself anymore. I find it easy but don't make images that fascinate me anymore.\u00a0Singing: I'm having some singing lessons and will go on a songwriting course this summer. Yes, singing makes me happy but I feel exposed when I sing in public so I need to learn how to do it with confidence. Cooking: I just love food and think it's the key to surviving and thriving.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-06 17:06:54", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 09:40:26.671171", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10641, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1382, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Food as the root</b>\n\nI quite agree.

Zemlji koja je imala perspektivu i potencijal da postane ne\u0161to drugo u odnosu na ovo u \u0161ta se pretvorila, a sam Bog zna kuda dalje plovi ovaj brod. \u017diveo sam u 4 dr\u017eave u svom \u017eivotu, a da se nisam pomerio iz svoje ulice. Bio sam svedok raspada moje rodne zemlje i njene transformacije od, kako su je nazvali \u201ehibrida II svetskog rata\u201c do zemlje \u201enebeskog naroda\u201c i sve manje \u0161ljiva pod koje \u0107e pre\u017eiveli mo\u0107i da stanu. Kako stvari stoje, \u0161ljiva \u0107e biti i previ\u0161e.\n\tVerujte mi, nisam pesimista. Pogledajte samo \u010dinjeni\u010dno stanje. \u0160to bi rekao pevac Sofronije, cifre ne la\u017eu. Sa godi\u0161njim mortalitetom od 35.000 ljudi (\u0161to je gradi\u0107 veli\u010dine Be\u010deja), Srbija spada u zonu u kojoj je \u201ecrvena lampica\u201c ne odavno upaljena, nego samo \u0161to nije pregorela. Kada ovoj cifri pridodam i broj onih koji su napustili zemlju od 2.000. godine (\u0161to je nekih 650.000 ljudi) shvatim da polako ali sigurno postajemo nacija staraca. Za\u0161to je to tako?\n\tRazvoj tehnologije je u velikoj meri dao svoj doprinos (ne, nisam obo\u017eavalac filozofije Neda Luda). Ukidanjem nepotrebnih radnih mesta (a nestvaranjem dovoljno novih), likvidacijom nekada\u0161njih giganata koji su slavno propali \u0161to tr\u017ei\u0161no \u0161to nebrigom dru\u0161tva i dr\u017eave, pove\u0107ava se broj pripadnika armije nezaposlenih koji svoju budu\u0107nost vide van granica na\u0161e nebeske domovine. Da se ne la\u017eemo, ni \u201enapolju\u201c ne cveta cve\u0107e i veselo \u017eubori potok, ali je \u010dinjenica da se retko ko od onih koji su po\u0161li trbuhom za kruhom vratio ovde da nastavi \u017eivot i \u010deka zaslu\u017eenu penziju. \n\tSa druge strane, edukacija u Srbiji je u procvatu. Da, ovo je sarkazam. Privatni univerziteti su po\u010deli da ni\u010du kao pe\u010durke posle ki\u0161e. Broj akademskih gra\u0111ana je dostigao zavidan nivo, a broj doktora nauka se u poslednjih 10 godina pove\u0107ao za 880%! Fascinantno, zar ne? Postali smo zemlja magistara i doktora koji svoje znanje u najve\u0107em broju slu\u010dajeva duguju internetu i \u201ecopy/paste\u201c komandi na ra\u010dunaru. Internet je nepresu\u0161ni izvor informacija i znanja koje je dovoljno prepisati i potom plasirati kao sopstveno istra\u017eivanje bez imalo skrupula. Zna\u010di, uskoro \u0107emo imati intelektualaca vi\u0161e nego osnovaca. Posta\u0107emo zemlja filozofa i njihovih sledbenika u kojoj, osim njih, ne\u0107e ostati niko mla\u0111i od 70 godina. Oni koji su smogli snage i hrabrosti da dignu sidro i nestanu u vidu lastinog repa \u0107e se (mo\u017eda) jednog dana vratiti da u\u017eivaju u penziji koju su stekli te\u0161kim radom u nekoj realnoj zemlji.

Hey, I protest! This is a dangerous cultural stereotype that also must be banished, because this stereotype is also a tool of domination. It is the stereotype of male as synonymous with aggression, domination and unable of intuition, caring and responsibility. So, if feminism speaks for the other in the female-male relations, I'm becoming masculinist and speaking from my side, because indeed I'm male and I'm feeling touched and ashamed by this kind of stereotypes. The history is full of hard-fought against domination of one sort or another, where certainly female oppression is one of them and is still open. And there is a really long story of million men fighting, losing their privileges and dying in this crusade through all of our history against the domination of all kinds. So, I only must be ashamed of myself if I had an overbearing and arrogant attitude that is not seeing value and equality in the others and discriminating against others because of their differences. But I can not be ashamed because of my gender \u2013 and by no other difference - cause in the event that I had to be ashamed of that, I'm certainly being oppressed. Thus, you are female, perfect! I'm male, perfect! Let us join forces together in an abolitionist movement that allows us to free ourselves from the all kind of chains that keep us dominated. Chains that are not only the ruling elites trying to preserve the status quo through a domination game, but ourselves through our conformity, apathy and mental structures full of stereotypes. So, as you rightly say, it does not make any sense trying to implement a sustainable \u201cMine becomes ours\u201d mindset, if we don't get rid of the dominating attitudes first.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 12:04:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.745177", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 367, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11971], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85653, "user_id": 4968, "topic_id": 14654, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Yes, thank @amelia. \nCan you let me have the concept note so I can better grasp the overall idea and see how and where the geographic perspective can better help, and also what kind of ethnographic study you have in mind (sorry, just stepped into the discussion...).

It can't take into account the complexity of each person needs and opinions.\n\nIt's obvious when we look at presidential, local or reagional elections as an individual is forced to chose a person who represents projects, goals, budgets in mostly every domain. He has to consider not only the ideas of the candidates, but also their political power which is made visible by another statistic tool : sondages.\n\nWhen voting in a representative, you have to make compromises as it's hard to agree with every part of a program a candidate will promote. And you also have to consider voting against a candidate. It happened in france in 2002 at the second tour o presidentail elections : we had to chose between right parti and extreme right parti. A huge part of the population could not feel well represented and had to make compromises and voted against extreme right.\n\nWith representative democracy, something weird happens : each individual takes a decision about fields and domains he's not informed about or simply doesn't care.\n\nThe importance of right parties (especially in france) can be explained by the fact they talk a lot about security of individuals and property and this message found many listeners for whom it is a crucial point. So they vote for it without considering the interest of the few, and are not aware about the consequences for poor people who are just another statistic.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA non representative democracy could be more relevant.\n\nThe people involved in social actions are the most informed about the reality on the terrain. They know the needs, the problems, the priorities... These people should be able to take policy decisions about their own field and speciality, not an elected person. Because representative democracy is about compromises.

Thank you. \n\n[quote=\"brian_m, post:1, topic:838\"]\nAt this University we are interested in whole population recovery and personal recovery; we know that systems as well as individuals can be broken and need to heal. We know they can.\n[/quote]\n\nExactly, and it reminds me of a lot of my explorations across the connections between individual, collective and planetary wellbeing. I think we must address our personal and collective brokenness across these spheres, and in  generous spaces.  From what I can tell, the ways you're approaching the University of Life is doing just that. \n\nWhile it's from a different field, you may be interested in the notion of \"study\" as Stefano Harney and Fred Moten see it in their prolific book _[The Undercommons: fugitive planning and black study](http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=516)_... \n\n\"So, we enter into the social world of study, which is one in which you start to lose track of your debts and begin to see that the whole point is to lose track of them and just build them in a way that allows for everyone to feel that she or he can contribute or not contribute to being in a space\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking more and more of study as something not where everybody dissolves into the student, but where people sort of take turns doing things for each other or for the others, and where you allow yourself to be possessed by others as they do something. That also is a kind of dispossession of what you might otherwise have been holding onto, and that possession is released in a certain way voluntarily, and then some other possession occurs by others.\" (Moten and Harney, 2015, 109)\n\nFor me, Moten and Harney suggest study-as-life, the \u201cfugitive art of social life\u201d. Whether it be their example of two men sitting on the porch just being and talking or in the social projects of ordinary life, it starts with the everyday and ends with the \u201cabolition of credit\u201d - the dissolution of a biopolitical hold over our capacity to live. What\u2019s more, in the context of the university, Moten and Harney suggest that study is a \u201cprophetic organization\u201d, \u201c\u2026 the prophecy in the organization of the act of teaching. The prophecy that predicts its own organization and has therefore passed, as commons, and the prophecy that exceeds its own organization and therefore as yet can only be organized,\u201d (Moten and Harney, 2015, 28). \n\nAnyway, I'm not wanting to bring too much theory into this University of Life, but simply share some connections that I see. On a personal note, I both have intimate experiences with a family member's paralysing drug addiction, as well as my own path around anxiety and its outlets. I cherish the possibility of the University of Life to offer a space that addresses personal and collective recovery through self-sustaining and self-organising means. \n\nAnd so ! Like @woodbinehealth I'm also curious as to how far you are in the University of Life's evolution? Depending on where, and within the limits of my own capacities and mental health (I'm currently in the midst of a major life transition), I'd be interested in potentially contributing some :seedling: support in setting it up. \n\nLooking forward to hearing more", "created_at": "2017-10-11 10:33:05.168169", "updated_at": "2017-10-11 10:33:05.168169", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 561, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [871], "is_reply_to": [871], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9209, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1404, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>If you want to see more of what James does</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://files.howtolivewiki.com/TRUTHANDBEAUTY/three_lessons_of_history/\">http://files.howtolivewiki.com/TRUTHANDBEAUTY/three_lessons_of_history/</a>\n\nis a talk that James did at the \\#TRUTHandBEAUTY event series in London.

My point of view is that in Italy, as far as I can see, most people - especially young - are deeply disillusioned with party politics, that in the last couple of decades has transformed into a long series of mudslinging actions occasionally interrupted by honest but feeble attempts to actually do something.\n\nUsually I point out to the disillusioned that if they are disappointed the only thing they can do is to try to change things. Otherwise they are stuck with what they have grown to despise.\n\nIn Italy, some 17 years ago, there has been an attempt to change some things in politics from the bottom, starting from groups of citizens who would meet spontaneously, without any formal affiliation, and that would then chose their representatives in a pyramid structure that peaked after several steps in a representative of the people. This attempt had only a temporary success, suffocated by ferocious attacks from one side and individualisms on the other - but it worked for a while.\n\nWith the support of even more people, support that can exist thanks to the social networks and the 'net in general, such change can become permanent. We can truly achieve a Wikicratic situation. Not tomorrow, but in time.\n\nAlso, to answer to your second question... my parents had been into politics in their 20s and early 30s, then they had grown deeply disillusioned.

And our ability to respond means navigating many interdependencies. So how do we avoid these situations in the future? How do we make sure that we have the fundamentals in place to stay healthy or even alive when crisis hits? In this series of listening sessions and follow up discussions we explore credible paths moving forward based on real life cases, not pie in the sky scenarios. ![image|120x104](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/282aced7f4f65d08f6ce2d031e24bad202d0e76f.jpeg) \n\n---\n\n## Text 2\nTo ground the conversation in lived experience on the ground, will invite protagonists of key intiaitives in the series of case stories on the platform ahead of the event.

Use this view as frequently as the view of your own codes so we maintain a project-wide view of the corpus.\n\n* Code merges now happen from the page of the code you want to merge, so n**avigate to the code you want to get rid of, not the code you want to keep, to implement the merge** (from a UX perspective, this is much better). Merging a code now keeps its parent intact.\n\n* All annotations of the child codes are automatically also assigned to the parent code, and are visibly different in the backend. This also means that to remove the annotations of the child from the parent, all we have to do is unparent the code. **We need to figure out if this is implemented in GraphRyder.**\n\n* We can now group users so that @Jan and @Wojt only see each others' codes as suggestions, as requested. If we do this, we need to be highly dilligent about consistently merging codes, on a weekly basis at minimum (but ideally after every batch of coding). I can explain my process and see if others think they'd want to adopt it --- it allows for me to keep my view at project level without losing the codes I assigned (by sorting by 'new' while also logging my codes in the codebook immediately). A shared codebook should also massively help with this, ensuring that one tab is chronological, one is alphabetical, and then one is a category tab (with as many additional as people want as sandbox areas).\n\n* Your default code list view is now your own, which should make backend work easier and less tedious. \n\n**2 _Hierarchy vs Category Discussion** (10 minutes)\n\n* We have decided against allowing multiple parents for one child code in the backend, for both computational reasons and organisational reasons. We need to keep distinguishing clearly between hierarchies (which are strict and ontological) vs categories (which are looser and more for the ethnographers' mental models). To implement a hierarchy, the code must *always*, regardless of context, belong under that parent code. This requires more careful attention to meaning in use, because a lot of the examples we have of parent-child relationships don't hold everywhere (e.g. the Pope is not always an \"influential figure\" to all informants, and so isn't a strict child of it). \n\n**3_Merging codes** (1 hour) \n\nProcedure: One member of each language team has their codebook open and is in charge of codebook changes. The other member has the Open Ethnographer backend open and is in charge of code merges. Please decide who is who before the meeting! \n\n**4_Merging codebooks (10 minutes)**\n\nWe will create a procedure for this and if there is no time remaining, do it asynchronously.", "created_at": "2020-08-06 09:30:04.771157", "updated_at": "2020-08-06 09:30:04.771157", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 658, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 16.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [81348], "is_reply_to": [81348], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35285, "user_id": 3769, "topic_id": 6881, "post_number": 1, "raw": "life is a beautiful Zyara <3", "created_at": "2017-09-02 16:08:58.262794", "updated_at": "2018-01-01 18:57:55.386554", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 578.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3782, 8, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40005, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 7793, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi @coloursinside nice to meet you!

It was founded 2 years ago and is having an impressive growth in sales.

Good points here, thank you for pushing me to a deeper analysis.\n\nI know I matter in the lifes of the people around me, and I am sure I matter in the company I work for (as they keep paying me and asking me to do things). But I would like to help make an impact on society on the whole, as much as I can. That's the reason why I joined Edgeryders: I think it is a group of people who can change things, all together.\n\nI still strongly believe in politics and I think I might have found a specific party here in Scotland that shares most of my views. I have not joined it, but I am openly supporting them.\n\nTrade unions, here in the UK, are pretty absent, and the right to strike is very limited and not accepted by a lot of people; I talked to the representatives of some unions, but I was not satisfied. To be clear (at least for the Italians here), I miss old-time CGIL.\n\nI feel that I - we - need to drive some change. Not a sudden revolution but a gradual, constant change. I don't agree with the idea that \"politicians shouldn't be in charge of politics\", as I'd rather have a professional doing such a delicate job. But I also think that politicians should (and some already do) listen. Many will of course listen to individuals who contact them, but the opinions and requests of a group will count more. This is what I am looking for - someone to join forces with. I am a team player. I play rugby, a sport in which individuals can't do much without the support of the whole team. I play bass guitar, an instrument that finds its role pretty much only in a band context.\n\nFor what concerns information - again, there are several ways to keep informed. Newspapers are the obvious one, but what they write is often partial. Social networks are at the moment probably the best source of information available - opinions and reactions are unfiltered, and the true opinions of the individual politicians/leaders/whatever come through almost always without having been thoroughly checked by their assistants.\n\nI think I - we - need to keep informed on what is going on around us because we want to change it. And you can't really change what you don't know. I think I need to be aware of what is going on, of who is involved in things, before I can even think of a plan of action to make it different. Before you decide what to cook for dinner, you need to know what is in the fridge. I won't promise you sushi if all I have is sliced bologna.", "created_at": "2011-12-07 10:08:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.622170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 473, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16062, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 2351, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Secondary combustion</b>\n\nThe gas given off from the charcoal production is fed into the stove and burns up nicely.\n\nThe stove has a secondary air inlet that puts warm air into the riser.\n\nI've tested the stove twice - once before it was completed when it worked well.\n\nThe second time I only had access to wet firewood and wet woodchip (which was placed in the retort to be turned to charcoal) The stove did not work well.\n\nI've got some dry wood and woodchip now but I won't have a chance to test fire the stove again for another couple of weeks.\u00a0 When I do I will do my best to get lots of good photos and videos and add them to the Appropedia page.\n\nMy first drawings for an efficient/clean burn stove looked a lot like the one you linked to above, but without all the insulating material.\u00a0\u00a0 After showing the plans to the very long running <a href=\"http://lists.bioenergylists.org/mailman/listinfo/stoves_lists.bioenergylists.org\">stoves mailing list</a> (one of the <a href=\"http://lists.bioenergylists.org/\">bioenergy discussion lists</a>) I ended up building something very different.\n\nHere are some pictures and plans of that stove <a href=\"https://mediacru.sh/6e4880b8f5c3\">https://mediacru.sh/6e4880b8f5c3</a> which I built a couple of years ago.\u00a0 Like a rocket stove it is meant to burn hot and fast.\u00a0 New wood is (in this case automatically) fed in slowly and the gases (smoke) that it emits has to travel through the already burning embers/wood and then ends up in an insulated chamber/riser where the now heated gases get mixed with heated secondary air and have a reasonably complete burn.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-26 01:41:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.108359", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 310, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84206, "user_id": 6670, "topic_id": 14511, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"marina, post:1, topic:14511\"]\non Mondays before the call, a provisional agenda is shared on riot and people are asked to add items on the list.

Zenroom  provides the cryptography and the sensitive data manipulation for the whole Decode project, implementing the Coconut credential scheme developed by UCL in 2018.\n\nValidation of the approach commercially is provided by the aqui-hire of Facebook of the UCL team to build LIBRA. \"In the absence of any detail on what might comprise a decentralized identity standard from Libra\u2019s perspective, some dots can be joined by examining the recent work of George Danezis and his co-founders at Chainspace, a startup acquired by Facebook in May.\"  Recently Microsoft announced their variation on a Coconut credential scheme.\n\nhttps://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/buried-in-facebooks-cryptocurrency-white-paper-a-digital-identity-bombshell\n\nAccountability over anonymity characterizes this approach as it underlies society in the 20th century itself. Tokenized trust is a key feature but only in the actual locality where face to face and communities of people work and live together.\n\nApart from innovation in code and coding practice LEDGER - a consortium of Funding Box, Bluemorpho and dyne.org, with VC, funding and business modeling expertise inside - is uncompromising when it comes to collaborative and meaningful cooperation. I was present at the kickoff on Amsterdam where Master of Ceremony Federico rearranged not just physically but also conceptually the notion of information sharing, but not having teams presenting in the usual ways.\n\nRecently, in fact last week, he took it a step further and brought all teams to Sicily to work on real world problems with real people in a real location.\n\nNow, ofcourse this is what most applications are about, but making it tangible and especially exploring the granularity of everyday life shows the uncompromising nature of Federico's array of methodologies (trasformatorio)\nhttp://trasformatorio.net\n\nSee for yourself:\n\nVimeo channel:\n\n- https://vimeo.com/370356587\n- https://vimeo.com/370369782\n- https://vimeo.com/370371288\n- https://vimeo.com/370372757\n\nGreetings, Rob", "created_at": "2019-11-04 12:53:13.203294", "updated_at": "2019-11-04 12:53:13.203294", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 398, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 32.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85369, "user_id": 6658, "topic_id": 14635, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Datum: 30. \u0159\u00edjna 2020 v 18:00 - 20:00 \nM\u00edsto kon\u00e1n\u00ed: Zoom (odkaz bude zasl\u00e1n 1 den p\u0159ed ud\u00e1lost\u00ed) \nOrganiz\u00e1to\u0159i: EdgeRyders \nREGISTRACE: https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14305\nPracovn\u00edm jazykem je angli\u010dtina, obousm\u011brn\u00fd p\u0159eklad do \u010de\u0161tiny bude zaji\u0161t\u011bn \n\n![Angelo di Mambro journalisming, in his own words|690x459](upload://o5N70ZSnq2n7F9b2tJA9f50K92n.jpeg) \n\n### Lok\u00e1ln\u00ed zem\u011bd\u011blstv\u00ed ve st\u0159edn\u00ed a v\u00fdchodn\u00ed Evrop\u011b: mohli bychom se inspirovat minulost\u00ed a p\u0159em\u011bnit nostalgii v n\u011bco nov\u00e9ho\n\nV cel\u00e9 EU je m\u00e9n\u011b ne\u017e 10% zem\u011bd\u011blc\u016f mlad\u0161\u00edch 35 let, ale ve st\u0159edn\u00ed Evrop\u011b je jich mnohem v\u00edce a trochu se li\u0161\u00ed - maj\u00ed v\u011bt\u0161\u00ed tendenci k inovac\u00edm, ke zm\u011bn\u011b my\u0161len\u00ed a k nov\u00fdm v\u011bcem.\n V\u011bt\u0161ina z nich d\u011bl\u00e1 zem\u011bd\u011blstv\u00ed tradi\u010dn\u011bj\u0161\u00edm zp\u016fsobem, jsou nuceni se vypo\u0159\u00e1dat s p\u0159\u00edrodou a jej\u00edmi projevy - povodn\u011bmi, \u0161k\u016fdci atd.

I definitely agree that we are all creators and this is a very important discussion about society and governments and the way they distribute education or have been so far.

Here we are at the core of my motivation for open design processes and enabling. Once people understand that their opinions, questions and ideas are highly important and that they can easily learn new skills and through this become more of a generalist, they also start to question the status quo. That is basically the privilege artists and designers have had until today: asking questions, having doubt and putting the finger in the wounds, coming up with innovative ideas or being rebellious in a political context. Which then was reduced to aesthetics and artsy expression. But basically this is what we all should do which in the end isn't anything different than being responsible for ourselves, our choices and the world we create around ourselves.

I had expected that being part of the freelancer week would mean that they would do some outreach for the events, but their website was quite badly designed and I do not think anyone found events through that. However, they were very helpful in finding people for the panels. \n\n\nI think the process I used for preparation worked well and I would like to develop it further. I had made the posts 2 weeks in advance starting to source questions from the community and also joined the meeting of the ethno-team shortly before and invited the ethno team concretely to add some questions that would make sense with what they are currently finding. I then gathered all those questions up a day before the event and send them to the panellists, asking them which they would be interested in reacting to most. Some answered very concrete, for the others I distributed the questions based on the information they had given in their bio's that were posted on platform ( [Matthew Mottola ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480), [Dani Ifrim ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dani-ifrim-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14584), [Nicole Gray](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nicole-gray-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14536), and [here the childcare panellists](https://edgeryders.eu/t/freelancing-remote-work-technology-and-childcare-panelists/14583)) and linked to the event posts. This way we had quasi audience engagement through those questions and I could plan and time the events rather well. I will write the summaries of the events today and then ask Laura to proofread them as multiple of the panellists asked to further share and publish those articles. Just two of multiple topics that I want to follow from there: In regards to the childcare one: I want a discussion asking specifically tech-savvy parents how they see tech use fo their children. In regards to the freelancer and tech one: There was a very clear conclusion there that the further development of tech for freelancers would have to focus on enabling collaboration between multiple freelancers. team tools are made for organisations, not for freelancers, but increasingly, freelancers work together in teams. \"Collaboratio over competition\" was the final credo of the session. There were also ideas for future tools collected in the thought experiment session. As said, working on those follow-up articles. The recordings can be found on the shared drive. The panel participants would be good contacts also for future things. For the remote work stuff, you mentioned author workshops. Matthew Mottola (https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480) for example is very well spoken on this and author of \"The huma cloud\". An Van and Christian from the childcare event (https://edgeryders.eu/t/freelancing-remote-work-technology-and-childcare-panelists/14583) Had some very interesting points on new work and tech development that I think we should follow up with them.\nI think the learnings and connections from the events could be useful for the remote work project edgeryders is taking on. The panellists gave positive feedback on the organisation of the events and the questions asked. \nWill also fill in my bio in the remote work thing today.\nSo: I think the format was good but would have needed more outreach and the follow up is actually extremely crucial. \n\nFinished the first follow up summary today, but in general, it would be good to discuss how much resources we have for that as it costs a lot of time. Could I request Laura or other copywriters to do such write-ups (or at least proofreading). \n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/collaboration-over-competition-freelancer-technology-event-follow-up-article-1ow/14709", "created_at": "2020-10-29 15:51:59.889648", "updated_at": "2020-10-29 15:51:59.889648", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 757, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [85976], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42027, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 8135, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Given that my dissertation topic is on smart cities, I feel I should have something to contribute here :D Currently working through a history of urban utopias and attempts to imagine communities of the future.

Most complex challenges (like getting food on the table for your family from a hundred sources and locations), are not one well-defined problem (grow apples), but a constellation of interdependent issues (transportation logistics, factory sorting and processing, demand & supply negotiations, regulation etc) undergoing constant redefinition and renegotiation. Any one organisation, no matter how efficient and smart, has no hope of containing any such challenge.\n\nAt the same time we see that in the face of large shocks to the system, organisations optimised for efficiency and profit cannot provide the means for material, relational, and existential resilience of neither individual nor society at large. Case in point: When supply chains are broken, even benevolent governments in affluent countries cannot access the equipment or protective gear to protect frontline workers on which we all depend to stay alive.\n\nOn the other hand, communities are getting smarter. The Internet has produced decentralized, scalable tools for coordination, archiving, and retrieval. It has also spawned cultural practices and ethical rules that incentivize people to collaborate with strangers. As a result, leaderless \"swarms\" of dedicated citizen experts are writing encyclopedias, mapping the Earth, doing science, developing and maintaining complex, successful software stacks. In each of these areas they outperform powerful businesses and government initiatives. \n\nThese initiatives display uncanny speed and efficiency, because communities are better than organizational hierarchies at making use of human intelligence. They treat every person \u2013 not just the top echelon \u2013 as a potential or actual expert, rather than as a passive consumer or beneficiary. They ask people to help, rather than charting their needs, and they have more human talent to throw at problems. They weed out under-performing initiatives in a healthy and natural way, making way for new life to emerge.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s a good example of the combined power of Smart Swarms to change the world. We all use it every day, and it\u2019s taking effective action on both poverty (poor people are using it too, all over the world!) and ecology (it\u2019s saving huge numbers of trees on paper books.) People are working together to solve a real human problem - access to knowledge - and it\u2019s improving everyone\u2019s lives. There\u2019s a tiny thread of financial capital \u2013 running the servers, say \u2013 but Wikipedia is a community-driven enterprise. It shows what can be done.\n\nWe want to achieve resilient lives and livelihoods. Contributing to Wikipedia doesn\u2019t put food on the table or ensure that communities support one another to mitigate the consequences of social distancing. Or even keep our mental health intact when automation wipes out the need for many professions, the foundation on which many of us build our identity and sense of purpose. We need to use a similar kind of effect to meet the material, relational, and existential needs of individuals and communities. And we need to develop sources of prosperity that secure their resilience by serving these needs.\n\nThis is not just semantics: it is about reframing livelihood generation from a lonely, competitive activity that only is accessible if you have money to sustain yourself while you build your business or have specialised training. To one that is collaborative, mutualistic, and accessible to all, regardless of your personal background. We frame the building of sustainable economic livelihoods as that of building an ecosystem, made up of many overlapping circles of people engaging in different activities. Commercial activity always relied on cooperation more than competition (but that was called an old boys club).\n\nThis summit is part of a series of activities aimed at co-designing experimental new social, business and investment models to withstand the shocks which will besoon be upon us as climate crisis and ecological devastation unfold.

When I was a student I used to be in AIESEC at University of Pireaus, but it wasn't very popular for students to be part in associations (except of political parties) and students were thinking that it is not so \"cool\" to be occupied in making a change :) Anyways, I think that this depends as well on the university and its students.\u00a0\n\nBefore asking you some questions about RAG I would like to share some of my thoughts about your report.\n\nFirst of all, I like the fact that you are into revitalising Irish language because I think that it is an amazing language and I support keeping our traditions and remembering our roots! \u00a0\n\nYou talked about honour and conviction that your government lacks, I come from Greece and I feel the same.. moreover people lose their faith in affluence (as Alberto has already mentioned before) and they don't have something to rely on if the goverment is not present and valid. I agree that it is US who need to do something about changing and I am happy that we have already realised it and we are on a process of engaging others!\n\nNow, I would like to ask you in which way RAG is helping the others students? Do you provide any kind of workshops and events about social innovation and entrepreneurship? Do you advice and consult with students' start ups?

Yes.</b>\n\nHey James,\u00a0\n\nspeaking as an economist (and relatively fresh from reading The Book on commons, i.e. Ostrom's <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/50649116/Ostrom-Elinor-Governing-the-Commons\">Governing the Commons</a>), I would like to try to address your first question. Health care is probably not a commons. A public heanth care\u00a0<em>system\u00a0</em>like the NHS, on the other hand, probably is.\u00a0\n\nHere is the reasoning. For a resource to be a commons, you need two conditions to hold. Both are properties of its consumption.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>consumption must be rivalrous: if I consume one unit of the resource, you cannot consume the same unit.</li>\n\n<li>consumption must be non-excludable: it must be impossible or very expensive to prevent someone from unduly consuming units of the resource.</li>\n\n</ol>Wikipedia has a useful matrix that classifies goods into private, public, common and club according to the properties of their consumption:\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good\n\nNow to health care. In a private system, health care is rivalrous and excludable (you can only access doctors and hospitals if you have the money to pay for their services. However, a system like the NHS is designed to be non-excludable, so it becomes a commons. We all pay into it, it can come under strain if too many people use it at the same time, but we can't easily stop others from accessing it, even incorrectly. an often cited case is that of elderly and lonely people with a lot of time on their hands and hypocondriac tendencies, who go to see their doctor almost every day - and this increases the number of doctors needed to serve everybody.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 21:02:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.004106", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 307, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20513, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 1102, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Facebook and networking</b>\n\nDearests, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/169061003259398/\">here </a>is the link to the Facebook event.

The software helps them to target the right readers: analytics tell them that someone reading it on an iphone is 5 times more likely to buy a 3 month  membership deal than someone on android - so they show a different deal to those than to android users. How it works: their long form reads are behind a paywall, but not fully. Readers can read several paragraphs, more than with others, before they hit the paywall. All members can get a shareable link and share the articles they want on social, giving their friends a one-time free pass to read the full story. They also publish one paragraph news stories without a paywall, often linked directly to other news sources.

Open Ethnographer is developed by the Edgeryders LbG company, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n**What's innovative?** In contrast to existing [QDA software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_qualitative_data_analysis_software), semantic markup (\"coding\") is not inserted into an offline copy of the online conversation, but right into the live content. This preserves the context, enabling extended analysis later. In addition, the semantic markup can be created collaboratively, the saved coding effort allowing more detailed research later. Lastly, the semantic markup can be public, enhancing the original author's content with semantic web integration \"for free\". We believe this innovation to have potentially disruptive applications for how ethnography is done and what role it plays in societal advancement \u2013 see also [our more detailed explanation](/t/id/3364).\n\n**This project is open!** Which means, you are invited to browse through our project workspace below, contribute to the discussion, to software development, and of course to using the free and open source software application when it's ready (about end of 2015-01). Core documents and tools for collaborating here:\n\n* **[Project workspace](/t/id/578).** You are already there :) Our project home and central discussion space. Core documents:\n\n    * [Project plan](/t/id/3902)\n    * [Prototype Evaluation](/t/id/3903)\n    * [Software requirements](/t/id/3904)\n    * [Software design](/t/id/3905)\n    * [paid tasks and how to collaborate](http:///en/open-ethnographer/paid-software-development-tasks#tasklist)\n    * [Manual](/t/id/3939)\n\n* **[Hackpad workspace](https://openethnographer.hackpad.com/).** For drafting / co-writing texts, which are then later transferred to this project here on edgeryders.eu.\n\n* **[Github repository and issue tracker](https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer).** Contains Annotator and its two Drupal integration modules that we use as base software as git subtrees. See [the manual](/t/id/3939) for how to deal with them.\n\n\n## 2. Graphryder\n\nThis is an interactive dashboard to explore and analyse [semantic social networks](https://edgeryders.eu/t/semantic-social-network-analysis-and-horizon-2020-edgeryders-is-looking-for-partners/7948). You interact with it with the browser. Developed in the course of the [OpenCare](/c/opencare) project by the University of Bordeaux and Edgeryders.\n\nMore on the [Github repository](https://github.com/opencarecc/graph-ryder-dashboard) \n\n\n## 3. Edgesense\n\n_Note that we Intend to make Graphryder take over the functions of this tool in the medium term._\n\nEdgesense is a social network analysis tool, which we use here on edgeryders.eu. It uses network analysis techniques to map relationships in online communities in near-real time \u2013 think Google Analytics, but for relationships between users. A prototype of this software has been used to perform a network analysis of the first Edgeryders community. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqDRcSSo6bY\n\nThis project was initiated by @alberto and various collaborators \u2013 some of them Edgeryders. It has since morphed in a component of a EU project called [CATALYST](http://catalyst-fp7.eu). Since January 2015, Edgeryders officially partners up with CATALYST to test two of their tools, Edgesense and Assembl ([learn more](/t/id/426)).\n\n\n## 4. Assembl\n\n_Note that we only tested this tool for a time \u2013 we don't actively use or develop it right now._\n\nA data science tool that allows you to exercise your skills as community manager, researcher or social networks enthusiast. Next to Edgesense, it is the second of the [CATALYST](http://catalyst-fp7.eu/us/) tools that Edgeryders is testing since the start of our official partnership in January 2015 ([learn more](/t/id/426)).\n\nWe want to see if they can help us better make sense of big conversations between networked citizens. The ultimate goal?

I am using this opportunity to introduce myself and to start a conversation in which I hope to find more clarity and insights on a matter I consider highly important in our daily lives \u2013 moral code and how we understand it, how we build it and what influences it, and how it affects what is 21st century religion or spirituality. In the ever-growing complexity of life, it is difficult to fully understand how to help people not to feel restrained by the moral code determined primarily by traditions and religion (which I believe need redefining and adapting).\n\nTo me, a moral code is a set of values and principles a person adopts going through life and which is then used in all situations to determine her course of actions. Those values and principles originate from different sources \u2013 our family, education, religion, traditions, but are also shaped by experiences. I believe that although there is a national culture, dominant religion and tradition, we are mostly exposed to them through contexts framed to us by our family, teachers, friends and people we meet. Our moral code is not only that, but **what ends up \u201cwritten\u201d in the code depends on how we and to what extent do we apply dominant interpretations,** which has much to do with situations we experienced ourselves \u2013 on a very individual level. With me, as with most others, it all started with my family. In our house, taking care of each other, spending time together, being kind to people and always learning new things were the biggest religion. I was 16 when I figured out we were religious (Orthodox Christians) \u2013 I was so focused on the family customs and studying that I missed out on the God part completely.\n\nI tried to understand the religion and traditional customs better, and how they applied to my life. Debates in my high school made it easy to challenge a lot of the concepts and to reflect on different opinions. Various authors I read, the people I hang out with from the Science Centre, university, debate, NGOs made me realize that I do not agree with how traditions and religion interpreted most of the things around us. They teachus to cherish and love our family, but the Church also seems to indicate that rule somehow does not apply to LGBTQ people or people of other race and class. They say women are the core pillar of society and family, but domestic violence is overlooked and women\u2019s sexual harassment issues ignored. The traditions put too much burden on a society by prescribing who should do what and how, and who is entitled to it.\n\nThose traditions and religious inputs collided with things that felt more naturally to me \u2013 if all humans are equal than the rules should apply to all, and not to some; that it is important what we think about how we treat each other and not be guided in our actions by some supposed higher authority; that being fair won\u2019t always pay off, but one should be fair anyways. As I was growing up it became more and more difficult to deal with all the contradictory inputs and insights I got from the exposure from all these different sources (cultural and societal norms which are set by tradition and religion, my own sense of morality, things I read and taught doing NGO work and volunteering and things I saw happening on a wider economic and political spectrum).**It feels that we have to deal with many more and faster changes than our parents and grandparents had to**, when information was not only a click away and they relied much more on the storytelling of the families and experiences from school and work. It was easier then to follow the \u201cmoral\u201d code \u2013 it was primarily connected to religion and to tradition, and there were less people challenging those codes and values. I am still grappling with living my life according to my own moral code, which I do not feel is shared by majority of the nation. Most of the time It feels like I live in a bubble in which spirituality is not connected to some sort of God or some stone-written principles, but rather to a group of values which can be interpreted differently and are flexible enough to adapt to new realities. I will use just one example \u2013 I was taught by my family but also by our dominant culture and religion that family is the backbone of society. To me, this meant that this rule applies when your child is LGBTQ/decides not to have children/decides not to go to college/doesn\u2019t have a steady job, but our societal and dominant moral code for now fails to adapts to the reality of this and to truly embrace what loving and caring for your family means (in my opinion).\n\nIn my life I try and apply this minority moral code to everything I do \u2013 I didn\u2019t like the work cultures I worked in before, so I created my own when I became an executive. I am not giving up on fighting for women empowerment, marginalized groups and pushing for climate action. In this I used to feel lonely, but in the past years a movement is starting to rise and narrative of what is dominant desired behavior is slowly changing. Having said that, even though people who share my values and \u201cmoral code\u201d are still a minority, it feels like that minority is rising in numbers. If the term \u201cnational\u201d can still be used in the framework of the globalized society, I believe that **the new culture and new spirituality, one that is human-centered and not tradition and/or religion oriented, can only be brought by bringing in more people to act on their beliefs and by showing that those who think like I do are not \u2013 in fact \u2013 alone.**\n\nIt feels impossible to say what spirituality means in 21st century on a global level \u2013there are opposite (again) sides of the spectrum and so many options in between. From being full on religious and seeing spirituality in believing in a higher force, be it God, aliens or\u2026well, spirits, to believing in people as the only arbitrators of what is moral, there are so many options. In the complexity and interconnections of different cultures, religions, traditions, trends - it is difficult to formulate what a national moral code is or what is indeed spirituality. The fluidity of concepts and constant challenges of the traditional moral code and constant changes make it difficult to understand what the code is. But **in these times it is of utmost importance to try and understand our own moral code, as it then serves as the personal compass in this big net of interpretations and alternative moral codes.**", "created_at": "2019-05-30 08:07:31.660134", "updated_at": "2019-11-09 12:31:12.737071", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1170, "wiki": false, "reads": 36, "score": 412.2, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [137, 3, 2915, 1856, 4, 3206, 5521, 5673], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78573, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13700, "post_number": 32, "raw": "@Wojt would you like to join the call on Thursday? @Jan fyi", "created_at": "2020-06-09 14:04:04.144754", "updated_at": "2020-06-09 14:04:04.144754", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78427], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25597, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5841, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>No stress!</b>\n\n@Pavlos : peace.

Thomas' package however only offers daily counts -- simply because wikipedia does not offer more through their API for the moment. So, as @mstn suggests, we may use a DB that would store these counts (and I understand there is one).\n\nI plan to use the daily counts and the code chain so a user could query the counts concerning some disease, for instance. I could then use the count data and feed it back to the user through a d3 visualization.\n\nI will certainly have time to wrap this up in the coming days (although I have other code to pamper with a deadline for next Wed, so it may only be ready by the end of Jan).\n\nThere are tons of other things we could do. It all depends on the task we are supporting. Building wikidata entities into a graph could be useful to guide user towards topics to its initial query, for instance.

It's quite all-some-nothing to me.\n\nThere are also a few questions that we have regarding how Graphryder works.\n\n1. What's the relationship between the hierarchies existing in the backend and the graphs displayed by Graphryder? Is there any relationship or does it just display co-occurences? E.g. will it show higher-order, \"mother\" codes only as long as they have annotations (no null codes) and co-occur with other codes?\n2. How likely is it that colours and/or non-SSNA will be adopted for POPREBEL? Doing that would make implementing Jan's grammar/meta-language much easier I think.\n3. When is the POPREBEL Graphryder updated? Do you guys do it manually? Does it happen regularly? Is it a lot of work? Will it ever show things in real time?\n4. Can I, without much knowledge about programming, make it show me just the codes used in the Polish community? What about the codes created/used by a certain annotator? Is there an option of making it display interactions between certain users of the forum? In a certain language (show codes with translations in a given language only)?\n5. Can I query the Graphryder to show me more than two codes co-occuring? Say I want to see how often \"Catholic Church\", \"politicians\" and \"conservatism\" co-occur. \n\nMoreover, I also wanted to confirm that we are going to be able to create multiple mother codes at certain point. We are, right?\n\nAnd, @matthias, when I want to add or just check if I've added translations to the all the codes I used (not just created), is there a better and faster way to do it than just methodically wading through my Annotations?

Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply \u2014 \u201creturn on data\u201d (ROD) \u2014 remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.\"", "created_at": "2019-06-15 07:34:51.627696", "updated_at": "2019-06-15 14:39:04.773260", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 244, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 32.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13694, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 4991, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>unMon Now</b>\n\nHello Tool:\n\nI think vague memories from the distant past. \u00a0If you've never before been to Palermo -- I was there all too briefly in September and loved it. \u00a0-- Please let me know if you meet any young community developers from Cianciana ( 2hrs southwards into the mountains.); I may complete a circle with them. \u00a0Now, I'm in Athens wrapping up the latest preSummit meeting of the unMonastic clan, and performing a site inspection of a promising location up-country. \u00a0I'm in transit tomorrow, but could then have a Skype call of some kind to bring you up to date, if that is what is desired, on Wednesday or Thursday. \u00a0Not sure how short deadline your short deadline has.\n\nCurrently I think that the best literature on unMonastery is not really on your list. \u00a0Depending on your needs: the developments in Athens are indicated <a href=\"http://athens.unmonastery.org/\">here </a>and the (best yet) philosophic discussions are distilled in <a href=\"http://howtoworktogether.org/think-tank/codeuncode/\">Code/unCode; Chronicles of the unRuly volume \\#1</a>\u00a0(downloadable pdf). \u00a0Also in our <a href=\"http://discourse.unmonastery.org/\">Discourse</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@unmonastery\">Medium</a> pages is a lot of the current understanding. \u00a0None of this is a tidy summary that you would like so much; I would like to encourage you here, but I am not sure that we do tidy summaries, however some of the text at the beginning of <a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/bios/#stakeholders-handbook\">Stakeholder's Handbook</a> may be useful.\n\nKeep me in the loop,\n\nBembo\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-30 15:37:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.386055", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 295, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10108], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55221, "user_id": 5188, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 95, "raw": "Just as a note - I ran a large web site/forum for 18 years and then another mid-sized for five and I never used any visitor data for anything....although I must admit to having shown some adsense ads on the larger site. Truth is, they never paid very well.\nI happened to find the ad model worked for me - due to lower overhead (just me, part time) and also due to \"direct to client\" ads. Since there was no such thing as an ad network at the time, I contacted manufacturers of said products (high efficiency wood/pellet stoves, etc.) and had them pay yearly fees from $800 to 10K+ for being featured on the site. I never packed any pages with ads so received zero complaints over two decades. The site was profitable (although I never started or ran it for money!) from the first year until I sold it.\n\nThe second site was also educational on robotic tech and cameras. Once again I used ads, but in this case they were affiliate. It turned out there were very few vendors of such products, so the readers were going to buy \"Brand Y\" almost no matter what...but if they bought it after reading my \"free\" information, I got a cut of it.  That did very well also...although again, not intended to make money.\n\nI will note this. The Affiliate model was one of diminishing returns while the \"direct client\" ad model was not. This is due to the obvious...once a site can make money with Affiliates, 100 sites (or more) will eventually pop up with little or no content but designed just to slice off a piece of that pie. Income from that site was cut in 1/2 three years in a row. It doesn't take math skills to see that this is not a sustainable model. Still, if the topic had still interested me I would have kept the site even with just \"beer money\" income.\n\nWhat amazes me is these well known sites (CNN, etc.) that literally have 100 ads or more (mostly clickbait stuff at the bottom). That is pure desperation as the return per ad has to be incredibly low.\n\nTop down change in those cases could come from ad networks by their limiting of allowable number of ads on each page.

How to delete an unwanted topic?</h3>\n\nClick \"Wrench icon \u2192 Delete topic\" below the topic.\n\nDeleted topics are retrievable at https://edgeryders.eu/?status=deleted ([reference](https://meta.discourse.org/t/50994/2)).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. How to see the deleted content written by a certain user?</h3>\n\n1. As an admin user, visit the user's profile page (example: [user matthias](/u/matthias)).\n2. Click the button \"Expand\".\n3. At the top, you'll see \"[number] deleted posts\". Click that.\n4. A list will appear with all content this user wrote that was deleted, also showing in the right side by whom (the user, or an admin).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. How to post to the official blog?</h3>\n\nThe [official blog](https://edgeryders.eu/tags/blog?view=topic-preview) is a collection of slightly better editorialized posts about Edgeryders as a community and a company. It is accessible from the `Company` drop-down menu on the top right.\n\nIn the edgeryders.eu website, the official blog is not a category but a view of the Discourse tag `blog`. Admins and moderators can include any topic for being published on the blog. To do so:\n\n1. **Write the post**. Remember: you are aiming for an audience beyond that of the community, so do not take too much for granted. If you are making a point that needs some background information, provide it. A good form is a one-sentence mention plus a link:\n\n    > Back in 2016, we had been active in [some project](http://www.example.com/). The point was to achieve this and this other goal. We succeeded, but we have never been completely happy for this reason. Now, we are moving on to the next level.\n\n2. **Choose a category for it**. A blog post can be in any category. If you are writing an update about a project, the best is probably to write within the project category. If the project has no category or lives in a private one, #campfire is a good fallback position, plus assigning the 'project-*' tag to the topic that corresponds to the project.\n\n3. **Add a nice image.** Posts with pictures are always nicer and more effective. \n\n4. **Add the `blog` tag**. This is done in the \"choose optional tags for this topic\" field in the edit screen. The tag tells the platform that your new topic should be visualized in the blog. Note that only moderator and administrator users can use this tag, so you might have to ask one of them to do this for you.\n\n5. **Make sure the image preview displays correctly.** The [blog view](https://edgeryders.eu/tags/blog?view=topic-preview) takes the first picture in the post and displays it as an \"ultrawide\" preview image in format 690\u00d7150 px. If this results in a good preview of your picture, no need to do anything. If it looks bad (maybe it cuts people's heads off) do the following:\n\n    1. With an image editor, crop your image (or another image) to proportions 690:150 (for example 690\u00d7150 px or 1380\u00d7300 px etc., as large as it fits for the excerpt of your source image that you want to show as the preview).\n\n    2. Upload it at the top of your post.\n\n    3. Edit the line of code relating to the uploaded image, so that it ends with `width=\"1\" height=\"1\">`.  This will \"hide\" the preview picture in the full topic view by displaying it in 1\u00d71 px size. A full line will look something like this: \n\n            <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/136c0f.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n\n    4. The ultrawide version of the image that you provided may also look good in your main text (so you can delete the version uploaded earlier). But in case you want to display it in full height (_not_ in the preview format) on the topic's page, you can keep both versions. The code will then look something like this:\n\n            [some text of the topic might be here, before the images]\n            <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/136c0f.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n            <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fedfbc1.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n            [remaining text of the topic]\n\n        The first line displays the ultrawide picture only in the blog view; the second one display the full height image in the main text. Remember you have to upload both the original and the cropped file, as they are images with different content now.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. How to create topic templates?</h3>\n\nA topic template allows to pre-fill the body of the Discourse editor with text when starting a new topic in a certain category. You can provide questions to answer or other hints for writing a good topic for that category. With this technique, the user has to first go to the corresponding category (for example using a link you provided) and then click the **<kbd>+ New Topic</kbd>** button. If you rather want to provide a link that opens a new-topic editor right away, see the section on [new-topic links](#heading--1-5).\n\nTo create a topic template:\n\n1. You need to be a Discourse admin or moderator user to access this function.\n\n2. Go to the category overview page of the category where you want to add the topic template.\n\n3. Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> in the top right.\n\n4. Go to tab \"Topic Template\".\n\n5. Enter the topic template text. You can use the same Markdown formatting as in the regular Discourse editor.\n\n6. Click <kbd>Save Category</kbd>.\n\n7. Click <kbd>+ New Topic</kbd> to see if your topic template works as expected.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-5\">1.5. How to create a new-topic link?</h3>\n\nDiscourse has [a hidden feature](https://meta.discourse.org/t/28074) where you can provide a special link, and clicking it will open a new topic editor that you can pre-fill with title, body text and tags. To encode your title or body text, use an online URL encoder; [the one at toolsvoid.com](http://www.toolsvoid.com/urlencode) is nice because it uses \"`+`\" to encode space characters, which makes the links shorter and more readable. The link has the following format:\n\n```plaintext\n/new-topic?title=\u2026&body=\u2026&category=cat/subcat&tags=tag1,tag2\n```\n\nYou can also specify the categories by [their numeric ID](#heading--2-1) rather than their name. This is better because such a link does not break when the category is renamed. In that case, the link format is:\n\n```plaintext\n/new-topic?title=\u2026&body=\u2026&category_id=123&tags=tag1,tag2\n```\n\nIf you want both a [topic template](#heading--1-4) when clicking the regular **<kbd>+ New Topic</kbd>** button *and* a link that opens a new editor, pre-filled with the same text, you need to provide the pre-filling text twice, once for each technique. Because even when omitting the `&body=` parameter in new-topic links, it will overwrite the topic template text, in this case with nothing.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-6\">1.6. How to use event topics?</h3>\n\nWe have installed a plugin that allows to mark a topic as an event, by adding the event start and end time to it. RSVP functionality is then also available, but we did not use that yet.\n\nSo far, we have enabled this option only in selected categories. To enable it in a new category, edit the category in tab \"Settings\" and enable \"Allow events to be added to topics in this category (overrides site setting).\" Then configure the event behavior with the further settings below that.\n\nThe event information is also available via JSON. See for example this JSON excerpt from an [example topic in JSON format](/t/11021.json):\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"event\": {\n        \"start\": \"2019-11-19T10:00:15+01:00\",\n        \"end\": \"2019-11-29T16:00:15+01:00\",\n        \"timezone\": \"Europe/Brussels\"\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Working with categories</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. How to find the ID of a category?</h3>\n\nYou need the category if you want to create a permalink to the category under \"Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Permalinks\". While topic IDs appear at the end of URLs, it's not that simple with categories. But here is a solution:\n\n1. Install a browser extension that allows to view JSON content properly formatted in the browser. For example in Chrome / Chromium, [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa) is a popular open source extension for this purpose.\n\n2. Modify the extension settings of the JSON viewer extension to let it access your page data on click only. We don't want anything to spy on you, do we.\n\n3. Go to the [Categories](/categories) overview page), then append `.json` to the URL and visit that page.\n\n4. Activate the extension to see the JSON content on this page properly formatted.\n\n5. Find the category I in this JSON document.\n\n    * For top-level categories, you will find an attribute `categories_list \u2192 categories \u2192 [list item] \u2192 id` for the list item with the suitable `name` attribute.\n\n    * For sub-level categories, you will find an attribute `categories_list \u2192 categories \u2192 [list item] \u2192 subcategory_ids` for the list item of the corresponding parent category. The order of entries in `subcategory_ids` is the same as the order of sub-categories below this parent category, so you can find the one for the sub-categoriy in question.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. How to convert a category into a topic?</h3>\n\nThis is not possible with any dedicated Discourse feature. You have to do the following steps manually:\n\n1. Edit the \"About the \u2026 category\" topic in the category and copy&amp;paste its content to a new topic in a new category.\n\n2. Adjust ownership for the topic now containing the \"About the \u2026 category\" content: click \"three dots menu\" (below the topic), then \"wrench icon\" (for \"Admin actions\"), then \"Change Ownership\".\n\n3. Assign all topics in the category to other categories. As a moderator / admin:\n\n    1. Click the \"list icon\" on the top left of the list of topics in this category. A list of checkboxes will appear, and some buttons.\n    2. Select some (or to select all, scroll till you reach the bottom, then click \"Select All\").\n    3. Click the \"wrench icon\" in the top right, select \"Bulk Actions\" from its menu.\n    4. Execute the \"Set Category\" bulk action.\n    5. Repeat as needed until no topics are left in this category. (Except for the special \"About the \u2026 category\" one, which you can't move even if you try. We copied over its content above already.)\n\n4. Delete the category. (Click \"Edit\" on the category overview page, then \"Delete category\".)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. How to create a new top-level category for a project?</h3>\n\nFor the Edgeryders top-level project, we use a few custom-made Discourse features and conventions to make it look the way it does. Here's how. Note that, to change the category structure and settings, you need to be a Discourse administrator (being moderator is not enough).\n\n1. **Create a new top-level category** for the new project.\n\n2. **Configure a category color**, based on the main color of your project's logo, and add it to the [allowed category colors](/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=category%20colors) in Discourse. By convention, the category color and logo color for project categories on edgeryders.eu should be a shade of blue. Configure that color in the settings dialog of your category.\n\n3. **Upload a category image.** From your project's logo, prepare a category image (150\u00d7150 px in size, PNG format, transparent background). Then go to tab \"Images\" of the category's settings dialog and upload that image.\n\n    :exclamation:  This step is important because only when a category logo is present, a category description will be shown at the top of the category's page (resp. sub-category's page). As a counterexample, see the \"[Documentation & Support](/c/docs)\" category.\n\n4. **Configure the way subcategories are shown.** In the settings dialog of your category, go to tab \"Settings\" and enable \"Show subcategory list above topics in this category.\" with \"Subcategory List Style: Boxes\". This is our convention for project categories.\n\n5. **Edit the category description** \u2013 it's in the auto-generated topic \"About the [category name] category\", always visible at the top of the category's topic list. There:\n\n    * **Add a one-sentence paragraph at the top**, separated by an empty line. This will be used as the short-form category description in the [/categories](/categories) overview page, on the category's own page, in the category dropdown list etc..\n\n    * **Add more content** below the first paragraph to explain the purpose and content of your category in detail and to engage users. This can include images, embedded videos etc..\n\n    * **Select all text after the first paragraph, then click \"gear icon \u2192 Hide Details\"** in the editor to wrap it into a `[details=Show more] \u2026 [/details]` tag. This will show the first summary paragraph and a \"Show more\" foldout link on the category's page (and, as a side effect, also when viewing the \"About the [category name] category\" topic directly).\n\n        Showing all \"About\" topic content on the category's page is [a custom feature](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/39) we added to create a more engaging category page. In standard Discourse, the category's page would only show the summary paragraph. While we use the `[details=Show more] \u2026 [/details]` tag to hide content dynamically, still keeping it accessible on the category's page.\n\n6. **Unlist the \"About the \u2026 category\" topic.** Either from the \"wrench icon\" menu on the topic's page, or from the bulk actions \"wrench icon\" menu on the category's list of posts, after selecting only this one. This will hide the topic for all normal users, as it's just redundant content for them, all shown at the top of the same category page already. Because the topic stays pinned, admin users however still see it at the top of the list, easily accessible for editing.\n\n7. **Change the ownership of the first post in the \"About the \u2026 category\" topic to user \"edgeryders\".** Usually done to have a more uniform appearance as categories and not distract users by presuming a connection between categories and individual users. There might be exceptions of course, where such a connection exists, and in that case the ownership perhaps should not be touched.\n\n8. **Create the subcategories.** Follow roughly the same steps as above for creating top-level categories. Some option will not be available. But in particular, the option to create an unfoldable category decription should also work for subcategories.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. How to create an access restricted category?</h3>\n\nThis is treated in its own topic here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/creating-an-access-restricted-category/8346\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. How to assign a topic to multiple categories?</h3>\n\nThis is not supported by Discourse, also not with plugins. Its whole architecture is based on \"one topic, one category\" ([see](https://meta.discourse.org/t/27966/6)). Depending on what you want to achieve, one of the following alternative solutions can be suitable:\n\n* **Sequential use of multiple categories.** Instead of assigning multiple categories at once, you would assign one, wait for some days or weeks, and the move the topic to another category. This can be suitable to attract attention in a highly frequented category first (in our case that's [Campfire](/c/campfire)) while moving it later to a more focused category with a more specific audience.\n\n    Users who contributed or subscribed to the topic while before switching categories will still receive notifications after the switch. In principle, a plugin could be created to add the category switching as an automated action to the [topic timer](https://meta.discourse.org/t/60731) feature; such a plugin does not exist yet, though.\n\n* **Assigning tags.** This is the core feature Discourse provides for multiple categorizations per topic ([see](https://meta.discourse.org/t/27966/2)). A topic can have one category, but any number of tags. Using tags incl. the tag groups feature to create a hierarchy between them can be very similar to a secondary category, as demonstrated by [the `cat2-*` tags](/t/6978) here on edgeryders.eu.\n\n    The tags used as secondary categories will have to be presented prominently on the frontpage to make sure they get used. Our current approach does not work for that \u2013 the \"[What we care about](/t/6978)\" topic, tucked away in the Community menu, gets about 120 views per month on average.\n\n* **Assigning tags, and subscribing people to them.** Using tags as secondary categories will be most powerful when users understand that they can and should subscribe to tags, just as they can subscribe to categories. On the edgeryders.eu platform, as of 2020-05 none of these features is in widespread use, though: there are [55 category subscribers](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer/?id=16) :lock:  (40 of which subscribing to 2 categories or less) and [11 tag subscribers](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer?id=17) :lock:.\n\n    A possible solution to this is to subscribe users to tags they are (probably) interested in, based on their observed interests. This [can be done](https://meta.discourse.org/t/22127/8) manually by staff users. If everyone gets subscribed to a limited, fixed amount of tags and this is part of the terms of use, it will not be seen as spam. People would also be able to manually unsubscribe and would not get re-subscribed to the same tag again.\n\n    There is currently no Discourse feature or plugin to support this, but [some attempts](https://experts.feverbee.com/t/2422) at creating such a function. The simplest-to-implement option would be a cron script that uses Ruby Console and runs every night to subscribe new users to a tag `gems` or similar that is used to attract user attention across category limits. Instead of force-subscribing users, sending them links to subscribe to tags comfortably is another option; similarly, there is no feature of plugin in Discourse to do so, but [ways to develop one](https://meta.discourse.org/t/57784).\n\n* **Inviting users to topics.** A finely targetable way to attract user attention to topics is to use the \"invite to topic\" feature in Discourse. There is currently no feature or plugin to automate this ([see](https://meta.discourse.org/t/92420)), but one could be developed, for example a cron script interacting with the Discourse ActiveRecord interface, inviting people based on a detected match of detected or tagged keywords and user interest.\n\n* **Mentioning users.** Just to complete this list: @mentioning users in a topic is also a way to draw their attention to it. Doing this in bulk is less click work than inviting users to a topic in bulk, as it allows to copy&paste lists of usernames. However, it also makes topics look ugly. Hiding the mentions into a `[details=\"\u2026\"] \u2026 [/details]` section might provide a solution to that.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Working with tags</h2>\n\nWe need to use tags this since we want to employ tags as additional ordering scheme to tag by \"aspects of wellbeing\" etc.. Tags in Discourse can be assigned to topics, but not individual posts. Recent versions of Discourse have made tags a core feature ([info](https://meta.discourse.org/t/48260/7)).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. How to tag content in bulk?</h3>\n\n1. Go to any suitable list of content (for example, a category page).\n2. Click \"list icon\" in the top left corner of the actual content table. (Mouseover text is \"toggle bulk selection of topic\".)\n3. Select all content items to tag, using the checkboxes that appeared. (If you click \"Select All\", it will only select the visible content on the page, so click to reload more until you reach the bottom if you want top operate on the whole category.)\n4. Click \"wrench icon\" in the top right, then \"Append Tags\".\n5. Select existing tags or enter new tags, then confirm with the \"Append Tags\" button.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. How to remove a tag?</h3>\n\n1. Go to the [global list of tags](/tags).\n2. Click on a tag.\n3. Click the \"trash can\" icon to delete the tag. (The content tagged with it will be kept, of course.)\n\nSince the `/tags` page lists only tags used at least once, not-in-use tags cannot be deleted this way. Still, they clutter the namespace of proposed tags when tagging content. To delete them, construct their URL in the form `https://edgeryders.eu/tags/{tagname}`, then proceed as above.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. How to know what tags are for what purpose?</h3>\n\nHere's a short reference (to be extended):\n\n* **Tags for project content.** We use Discourse in a way that involves frequent re-categorizing of content, depending on our needs. Also, project-based categories are regularly dismantled after the end of the project, and the content is sorted into broader categories, to keep the numbers of categories small. In order to still keep together project content, we use the \"`project-*`\" tags, made from the prefix and the project's name. It is not necessary to tag project content while there is a project category, only when dismantling that.\n\n* **Tags for ethnographic coding.** Tags of the form `ethno-*` are used by Open Ethnographer to define ethnographic corpora for the various research projects where Open Ethnographer is in use ([details](/t/-/6811#heading--6-1)).\n\n* **Tag to indicate coding priority.** The code `codepriority` can be used to tell ethnographers which content to prioritise when coding. \n\n* **Tags for the wellbeing ontology.** Tags of the form `cat2-*` are used to sort topics into our wellbeing ontology. Navigation using that tagging is available in the main menu under \"[Community \u2192 What We Care About](/t/6978)\".\n\n* **Tag `blog`**: Used for all topics that we want to give prominence in the official Edgeryders blog (\"[Company \u2192 Official Blog](/tags/blog?view=topic-preview)\" in the menu). Assigning this tag automatically adds it to the blog, but the tag can only be used by Discourse moderators and admins. This includes all topics that were in the \"Blog\" group of our Drupal-based platform. You can subscribe to our blog with your RSS reader, as Discourse has RSS for everything. In this case, it's https://edgeryders.eu/tags/blog.rss.\n\n* **Tags for Drupal content types:** Upon import from Drupal, tags were assigned to keep track of the original node's content type. These are: `task`, `wiki`, `document`, `event`, `challenge_response`, `group`, `minisite_page`, `journal`, `page`, `infopage`. These tags will eventually be removed, once we are sure we don't need them to finish Drupal-to-Discource migration related tasks. Tag `post` has already been removed, as posts did not have any special features to be aware of.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. How to filter a list of tagged topics also by category?</h3>\n\nThis is a \"hidden\" feature without a way to do this in the graphical interface, because we disabled the \"tag\" filter on category pages. So this feature is used by constructing a URL in the following way, as also documented [here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/21916/5):\n\n    https://edgeryders.eu/tags/c/{category-slug}/{tag-name}\n\nFor example:\n\n https://edgeryders.eu/tags/c/openvillage/event\n\nNote that the same list results can also be shown by constructing a search query with tag and category filters set, but the format of the output will be different. Example:\n\n https://edgeryders.eu/search?q=tags%3Aevent%20%23openvillage\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Working with users</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. How to be notified about new user signups?</h3>\n\n**How to be notified.** To be notified about new user signups, simply subscribe to topic \"[New members on edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/t/new-members-on-edgeryders-eu/9471)\". Use the \"Tracking\" or \"Watching\" notification level, and updates from this topic will be included in your regular Discourse notifications, both on the platform and via e-mail. Discourse will add one comment to this topic whenever a new member registers on edgeryders.eu. (Note, when somebody only registers on our login site communities.edgeryders.eu but never logs in to edgeryders.eu, this will not trigger a notification.)\n\n**How to not be notified.** By default, a user will not be notified about any updates to this topic, until they choose to as described above. (This is implemented by setting this topic to \"Unlisted\". Unlisted topics do not appear in the \"Latest\" tab for anyone, or in the \"New\" tab of people who subscribed to this topic's category. This is better than requiring everyone with access to this topic to set it manually to \"Muted\" in order to not get notifications, but basically has the same effect.)\n\n**Access to the user signup feed topic.** This topic is in our \"[Documentation & Support \u2192 Unpublished](/c/docs/unpublished)\" category, so it is not accessible to the public. This allows to link to this topic from a public topic without giving access to it; for example the link above in this manual.\n\n**How to set this up for your own Discourse installation.**\n\n1. Install our plugin [edgeryders-signup-notification](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/tree/multisite/plugins/edgeryders-signup-notification).\n\n2. Create a topic that should act as the user signup feed, place it in an access protected category, an set it to \"unlisted\" (see above for the reasons).\n\n3. Enter the topic ID of your signup feed topic in the settings of the edgeryders-signup-notification plugin.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. How to welcome new members on the platform?</h3>\n\nSee topic \"[Welcoming new members](/t/id/8305)\" (access restricted).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. How to see user statistics?</h3>\n\nThe platform serves a screen with the full history and participation stats for each user. Example, for username `moe`: https://edgeryders.eu/u/moe/summary . There is also a summary version in the `Users` item in the hamburger menu. And it is wonderful to use: filterable, sortable by any statistic with one click.\n\nThere are obvious data structure implications. Implicitly, a network is being induced where the users are nodes, and there are two layers of edges: `A likes-the-content of B` and `A replies-to-the-content-of B`. This means that, in the data structure, there is a full users-to-content bipartite network. Would like to discuss this with @matthias in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. How to obtain data with user consent for research use?</h3>\n\nThe Edgeryders platform has a feature called an *ethical consent funnel*. This serves to users trying to post for the first time a popup form that we call the \"consent funnel\": it asks users to answer some questions before they are able to post in certain categories. They can only proceed past the form when they have answered its questions correctly. We interpret this sequence of events as follows: the user has given informed consent to participating in a research project with Edgeryders, and has understood the nature of her part in the exercise. \n\nAccessing these data requires API access. See the [API documentation](/t/id/7904).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-5\">4.5. How to delete a user account?</h3>\n\nPlease follow the hints given in [our website manual](/t/id/6463), section \"4.1. Deleting your account\".\n\nIn some cases, you have to temporarily adjust the following Discourse settings to be able to delete all posts of a user at once, and then the user:\n\n* [delete all posts max](/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=delete%20all%20posts%20max)\n* [delete user max post age](/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=delete%20user%20max%20post%20age)\n\nYou need to be administrator (not just moderator) to be able to do this. Remember to re-set these settings to their previous values afterwards, as they serve as safeguards against harm done accidentally or intentionally by staff users.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-6\">4.6. How to fix a user's signup problem?</h3>\n\nWhen somebody tries to sign up but, sometimes they get stuck, most likely because the e-mail address validation e-mail gets caught up in their spam filter. In these cases the problem can be fixed with the help of an admin of communities.edgeryders.eu, as shown below.\n\nThese instructions have been tested with current Chrome (Chromium) and Firefox in 2019-02.\n\n1. Find and contact a communities.edgeryders.eu admin via [this list](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/about) for help, or if you are that admin yourself, proceed as below. (Being a moderator on communities.edgeryders.eu is not enough as these cannot use the \"Impersonate\" feature.)\n\n2. Open an \"incognito window\" (Chrome) or \"private window\" (Firefox), and _perform all the following actions with browser tabs in that window_ until the instructions say to go back to your normal browser window.\n\n    (You could keep working in your normal browser window, but would be logged out at the end of the process. Using an incognito window prevents that, as it allows a parallel login.)\n\n3. Log in as admin on [communities.edgeryders.eu](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/).\n\n4. Find the record of the user with the incomplete signup under \"[\u2630 \u2192 Admin \u2192 Users \u2192 New](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/admin/users/list/new)\". Users which did not yet successfully validate their e-mail address are shown in gray in that list.\n\n5. Click on the user record in that list, make sure the user's e-mail address does not contain a mistake, and then click \"Permissions \u2192 <kbd>Activate Account</kbd>\".\n\n6. At the page bottom, click <kbd>Impersonate</kbd>. This will log you in as that user until you log out or close the incognito / private window.\n\n7. In a new browser tab, visit the Edgeryders Communities platform which the user wanted to join, such as edgeryders.eu.\n\n8. Click \"Log In\" in the top right. This will immediately log in the user you impersonated on communities.edgeryders.eu. Since it is their first login there, it will create the user's account and take over their username, name, e-mail address and profile picture from communities.edgeryders.eu.\n\n9. Log out as the impersonated user, or just close the incognito / private browser window.\n\n10. Back in your own normal account on an Edgeryders Communities platform such as edgeryders.eu, you can now @mention the new user or send them a message, because you created their account on this platform with admin tools. The system will send them an e-mail about the @mention or message, but of course if the user has a badly configured spam filter that e-mail might get caught up there again.\n\nThe above process can also be used to create an account for a user who did not even attempt to sign up themselves. The admin user would simply simulate the user filling the signup form, and then proceed as admin user for account activation and creating the connected account on an Edgeryders Communities site. When doing this, make extra sure to use the right e-mail address, as the process allows to create accounts (and cause e-mails from these accounts) for people who never wanted one.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-7\">4.7. How to mass-download profile pictures of category contributors?</h3>\n\nSometimes, you might like to create a publication that includes profile pictures of everyone who contributed to a specific category (or its sub-categories). We prepared a way that allows to mass-download these profile pictures to a chosen directory:\n\n1. Visit the Data Explorer query page \"[Profile Pictures: for one category](https://edgeryders.eu/g/trust_level_0/reports/31)\".\n\n2. In field `category_id`, enter the ID of the category of interest. This can be any top-level or sub-level category on the platform. At the top of the page, you find a quick overview of the category IDs of our top-level categories. Otherwise, you can find the required category ID as the number in category links, which are all listed on the [front page](https://edgeryders.eu/).\n\n3. Click <kbd>\u25b8 Run</kbd> to execute the query.\n\nNow you'll see a list of all users who contributed to the category, with a profile picture URL where available. (Users without a profile picture are included so that you can mention them with their username or with a placeholder picture, if desired.)\n\nThe next task is to mass-download these links. Here is one comfortable option for Firefox, but of course you can use whatever download manager solution you like:\n\n1. Install the [Simple Mass Downloader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-mass-downloader/) extension.\n\n2. Select the text in the result table, but not text in the rest of the page.\n\n3. Right-click and select \"Add selection-links to list\".\n\n4. In the next dialog, check all boxes, enter a to-be-created directory into \"Set directory for checked files\" and click \"Download now\". This will all profile pictures into a directory of the given name inside your browser's default download directory.\n\n5. If you don't know where your downloads landed, you can find out via the normal \"Downloads\" button in the Firefox toolbar. Click that button, then \"Show all Downloads\" in its menu, then any folder button at the right of any of the downloaded profile picture files. That will open the profile picture download folder in your file manager application.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Understanding notifications</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. Notification types and places</h3>\n\n**Notification types.** To understand Discourse notifications, we distinguish the following two different broad categories of notifications. (Discourse does not use this concept in their own manuals \u2013 we made it up.)\n\n* **content notifications:** Any notification about new content (topics and posts) to which a user is somehow subscribed. These show up on-platform in the \"Unread\" and \"New\" sections and sometimes by e-mail.\n\n* **event notification:** Any notification about a more specific event than simply \"new content\", namely: direct reply, quotation, @mention, likes, invitation to a topic, edit of your post, private message, new topic, link to your topic. These show up on-platform as a blue bubble on the user menu and as an entry inside it, with an icon corresponding to the event type. They also sometimes show up as e-mails.\n\n**Notification places.** As already briefly mentioned above, notifications can appear in different places:\n\n* **user menu:** The place where event notifications are shown on the edgeryders.eu platform: as little blue bubbles in the user menu, which always correspond to an entry in that user menu.\n\n* **counters:** The place where content notifications are shown on the edgeryders.eu platform: as counters in the user's \"New\" (for new topics) and \"Unread\" (for new replies) sections in the frontpage and hamburger menu.\n\n* **e-mail:** An e-mail sent to the user's registered e-mail address. One e-mail can contain one event notification, or one or more content notifications (aggregated according to the \"Activity Summary\" settings in a user's account).\n\n* **desktop:** Desktop notifications. Not treated in more detail below, as they are simply a copy of event notifications that appear in the user menu. (Content notifications do not appear as desktop notifications, ever.)\n\n    Desktop notifications appear only in a browser if the user enabled them by visiting the user settings form with that browser.\n\nTrigger actions, notification types and notification places are connected by rules that govern what notifications Discourse will shown when and in which place, as detailed below.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. Trigger actions and the notifications they create</h3>\n\nWhich notifications are sent for which action is influenced by several factors. The most important one is the notification level configured per user for topics, categories and tags. But there are other factors as well \u00ad\u2013 here are the details:\n\n1. **When you create a new topic**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Content notifications:** For users who subscribed to the topic's category (which could be \"Uncategorized\") with level \"Watching First Post\" or higher, or to any of the tags that you added to the topic with level \"Watching\" or higher.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"new topic\":** For the same users who got the content notifications already. This is the only case where content notifications also result in an associated event notification \u2013 the same behavior does not apply for replies to content a user is subscribed to, only for the \"new topic\" case!\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"quoted\":** For users you quoted in the topic, if any. _[TODO Check if this also applies when a user set the topic's category or any of its tags to subscription level \"Muted\". Probably it does. Also find out if and how user muting influences this notification.]_ If this event notification leads to an e-mail to the user depends on the user's setting \"user menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Email \u2192 Send me an email when someone quotes me, replies to my post, mentions my @username, or invites me to a topic\". It is enabled by default.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"linked\":** For the author of the post you linked to, if any. This notification will be shown on-platform, not by e-mail. _[TODO: Check if link notifications can only appear for posts that started a topic, or indeed for all posts. If necessary, also adapt this below where the same event is treated for editing post content. Also find out if and how user muting influences this notification.]_\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"@mention\":** For users you @mentioned in the topic, if any. The same restrictions as for the \"quoted\" event apply, see above.\n\n2. **When you post in an existing topic**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Content notifications:** For users who subscribed with level \"Tracking\" or higher to the topic itself, to the topic's category, or to any of its tags. These subscriptions form a hierarchy: if the user muted the notifications of the topic's category or any of its tags, she will _still_ get the notification if she overrode that setting on the topic level explicitly.\n\n        Subscribed users also include those who have been reading the topic for some time. as governed by the setting \"Automatically track topics I enter\" in \"user menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Notifications\". The default value is \"after 3 minutes\".\n\n        Subscribed users also include the topic's original author, who is automatically subscribed in level \"Watching\" (the highest) to the topic she created, until manually overwriting that. When transferring authorship of a topic to another user, it does _not_ affect the notification level set for the topic by the the original or the new author.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"direct reply\":** For the user to whom you replied. If you reply to the first post or whole topic, it counts as a direct reply to the topic author. _[TODO: Confirm that e-mails are only sent for direct replies, not for indirect ones.]_\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"quoted\":** (For details, see above for the same event.)\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"linked\":** For the author of the post you linked to, if any. This notification will be shown on-platform, not by e-mail.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"@mention\":** (For details, see above for the same event, and about auto-tracking of topics in muted categories and tags as documented for \"quoted\" events above.)\n\n3. **When you like a post**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"Like\":** For the author of the post you liked, but only if this is allowed by the user setting \"Notify when liked\". Note that wiki posts are not treated specially: only the user shown in the avatar icon is considered the author of the post who will be notified about likes.\n\n4. **When you invite somebody to a topic**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"Invite\":** For the user you invited. If this event notification results in an e-mail depends on the user setting \u201cuser menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Email \u2192 Send me an email when someone quotes me, replies to my post, mentions my @username, or invites me to a topic\u201d. It is enabled by default.\n\n5. **When you edit the content of a post**: If the post is your own, no notifications whatsoever are created. Otherwise, it does not matter if this post is wiki or not, or if it is the first post of a topic or not. Discourse creates the following notifications:\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"Edit\":** For the author of the post. Note that wiki posts are not treated specially: only the user shown in the avatar icon is considered the author of the post who will be notified about likes. For the e-mail created by this event notification, the same restrictions as for the \"quoted\" event apply, see above.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"quoted\":** (For details, see above for the same event.) _[TODO: Find out if this notification is created at all when editing post \u2013 we haven't see it in practice so far.]_\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"linked\":** For the author of the post you linked to, if any. This notification will be shown on-platform, not by e-mail. _[TODO: Find out if this notification is created at all when editing post \u2013 we haven't see it in practice so far.]_\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"@mention\":** For anyone @mentioned in the new version of the post and has not set the subscription for the topic, category or tag to \"Muted\". The on-platform notification will appear to come from the editing user, which is confusing where this is not the original author of the post. (For more details, see above for the same event, and about auto-tracking of topics in muted categories and tags as documented for \"quoted\" events above.) _[TODO: Find out if and how user muting influences this notification.]_\n\n6. **When you change the category of a topic**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Content notifications:** For users who subscribed to the topic's new category with level \"Watching First Post\" or higher, and have not read the topic before. However, if you add the tag with the admin bulk actions feature, no content notification is created.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"new topic\":** For the same users who got the content notifications already. _[TODO: Confirm that this really happens. Maybe not, because the topic is not exactly \"new\".]_\n\n7. **When you add a tag to a topic**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Content notifications:** For users who subscribed to the tags that you added to the topic, with level \"Watching\" or higher, and have not read the topic before. However, if you add the tag with the admin bulk actions feature, no content notification is created.\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"new topic\":** For the same users who got the content notifications already. _[TODO: Confirm that this really happens. Maybe not, because the topic is not exactly \"new\".]_\n\n8. **When you send somebody a private message**, Discourse creates:\n\n    * **Event notifications for \"private message\":** For the recipient(s) of the message. This notification will be shown on-platform, and possibly by e-mail. The latter depends on the user setting \"user menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Email \u2192 Send me an email when someone messages me \u2026\". It is enabled by default.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. Where and when does Discourse show content notifications?</h3>\n\nIf the event-triggering user is muted by the recipient (under \"Account Menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Notifications \u2192 Users: Muted\") or if the content is muted by the recipient, the notification event is not shown anywhere. Else, it is always shown as on-platform, and maybe by e-mail, as governed by the highest notification level found among the user's settings for the topic, category and applied tags.\n\nAn e-mail is however not sent immediately. If the target user is active on the platform (\"clicks any link or button\") after the on-platform notification was created, no e-mail is sent because the platform assumes that the user already saw the blue notification bubble (even if not opening the menu and clicking on the notification). The platform will wait for a minimum of 10 minutes for such activity (see in \"user menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Email\": \"We'll only email you if we haven't seen you in the last 10 minutes.\"). This is the default behavior, but the user can also configure Discourse to send e-mails even when she is active on the platform.\n\nIn addition, the platform will wait longer than 10 minutes before sending an e-mail, as required to give users a chance to finalize their content first by re-editing it after posting. Currently, this is 10 minutes for normal content, so no additional wait time over the default 10 minutes from \"waiting for user activity\" (see config parameter \"[email time window mins](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=email%20time%20window%20mins)\"). It is however 20 minutes for private messages (see config parameter \"[private email time window mins](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=private%20email%20time%20window%20seconds)\"). _[TODO: Confirm if that latter config parameter indeed refers to private messages, or to posts in protected categories.]_\n\nIn addition, the platform might wait _even_ longer before sending an e-mail, depending on the user's subscription level for the concerned content. Subscription levels have the following effects:\n\n* **Notification level \"Muted\":** The notification is not shown on-platform, and also not by e-mail.\n\n* **Notification level \"Normal:\"** The notification is not shown on-platform, and also not by e-mail. The user can still get a notification for quotes, a direct reply or an @mention, but this is covered under \"Event notifications\" below.\n\n* **Notification level \"Tracking\":** \"New\" counter for a new topic in a tracked category / with a tracked tag, \"Unread\" counter for every new reply in a tracked topic. These are entries in the user's \"[New](/new)\" resp. \"[Unread](/unread)\" tabs on the platform. Note that entries in the \"New\" tab will disappear automatically again as governed by the user's setting \"user menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Notifications\u2192 Consider topics new when:\".\n\n    If the content results in a current entry in the \"Unread\" or \"New\" tab, an e-mail is sent for that content _if_ the user has enabled the setting \"When I don't visit here, send me an email summary of popular topics and replies\". These e-mails are aggregated into activity summary e-mails (\"digests\") according to the maximum frequency configured by the user. _[TODO: Find out the default value for that setting and the associated frequency setting.]_ In addition, there is a user setting that lets users exclude \"New\" tab content from new users in e-mails, as they are spammers with some likelyhood (see user setting \"Include content from new users in summary emails\"). _[TODO: Document what the default value for that setting is.]_\n\n* **Notification level \"Watching\":** Like \"Tracking\", but e-mails are sent immediately. So they are not included into the next digest / activity summary.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. Where and when does Discourse show event notifications?</h3>\n\n**Not at all from blocked users.** If the event-triggering user is muted by the recipient (under \"Account Menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Notifications \u2192 Users: Muted\"), the notification event is not shown anywhere.\n\n**As user menu and desktop notifications.** By default, the notification is always shown as in the user menu and (if the user enabled them) as a desktop notification. _[TODO: not sure about this, to be checked]_. Event notifications do not influence the \"New\" and \"Unread\" counters.\n\n**As e-mail.** Depending on the triggering event and the user's settings for such an event, it will also be sent as an e-mail. See the list of triggering events above for the details.\n\nAnyway, an e-mail is not sent immediately: if the target user is active on the platform for a certain time window after the on-platform notification was created, no e-mail is sent. The default time window is 10 minutes but users can change this in \"user menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Email\": \"We'll only email you if we haven't seen you in the last 10 minutes.\" In addition, a user can also change this default behavior in the user settings to send e-mails even when she is active on the platform.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. Other aspects</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-1\">6.1. How to work with the Discourse API?</h3>\n\nWe supply the standard public and access protected Discourse APIs, and also our own extensions to the access protected Discourse API that allow access to ethical consent data and to OpenEthnograper codes and annotations.\n\nAll the details are documented here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/using-the-edgeryders-eu-apis/7904\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-2\">6.2. How to create a custom Discourse theme?</h3>\n\nThis is treated in its own topic here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/creating-a-custom-discourse-theme/7\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-3\">6.3. How to create a Data Explorer query?</h3>\n\n[Data Explorer](https://meta.discourse.org/t/32566) is an official Discourse plugin that allows to create and run SQL queries against the live Discourse database. It allows to create any kinds of up-to-date statistics and to extract any data that Discourse has stored. There is also a way to make these queries accessible to others than just admins, even to the general public.\n\nGeneral instructions for creating and sharing a Data Explorer query:\n\n1. Go to \"[\u2630 \u2192 Admin \u2192 Plugins \u2192 Data Explorer](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer)\". You'll see a list of queries that you can visit and run from their details page.\n\n2. To create a new query, clic <kbd>+</kbd>, enter a query name and click <kbd>+ Create New</kbd>. This brings you to the detail page for editing and executing the query.\n\n3. Add a description, enter your SQL query, and click <kbd>\u25b8 Save Changes and Run</kbd> to test your query. The right-hand list of SQL tables and columns helps you create the right query. You can copy &amp; paste the SQL from a similar, existing Data Explorer query to have a starting point, either from [our list of queries](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer) or from the [official list](https://meta.discourse.org/t/43516) of cool Discourse Data Explorer queries.\n\n4. To make your query adaptable without having to change the SQL code, you can add parameters. This is esp. relevant if you want to make it accessible to other users, because non-admins can only execute the query but not change its SQL code. There is no complete documentation about parameter usage anywhere so far, but the following example section shows all the relevant options. You place it at the beginning of your query, and use the colon-prefixed identifiers to refer to the parameter inside your SQL.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    -- [params]\n    -- date :start_date = 2019-08-27\n    -- text :period = week\n    -- null int :topic_id\n    ```\n\n    (There is also an advanced technique of deriving ENUM values from entered parameters, shown [here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/43516/254).)\n\n5. To make the query accessible to more users than just admins, enter names of user groups into the box \"Allow groups to access this query\". Then, in the [list of queries](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer), you'll find group-specific access links that you can share with users in the respective groups. Users can also see an overview of data explorer queries accessible to a group they are part of by visiting tab \"Reports\" of the group's page ([example URL](https://edgeryders.eu/g/moderators/reports)).\n\n    The query's page in the admin backend is still only accessible to admins (for example, a URL of the form `https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer?id=30`).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-4\">6.4. Staff</h3>\n\nStaff members are official representatives of this community. There are two kinds of Staff:\n\n1. **Admins**, who can do anything and configure anything on this site.\n2. **Moderators**, who can edit all posts and users, but cannot add categories or change any site settings.\n\nStaff members can exercise their admin superpowers any time via the admin dashboard at [**`/admin`**](/admin). You can also access it via the \"hamburger\" menu <kbd>\u2630</kbd> in the upper right. Admin functions are generally marked with the wrench :wrench:  icon, so look for that.\n\nTo add additional staff members:\n\n* have them sign up on the site (or [send out an invitation to join via your user page](/my/invited))\n* click the admin button :wrench: on their user page\n* look for the <kbd>Grant Admin</kbd> and <kbd>Grant Moderator</kbd> buttons there\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-5\">6.5. Social Logins</h3>\n\nUsers can log in with traditional local username and password accounts. You may want to add:\n\n* [Google logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-google-oauth2-login-for-discourse/15858)\n* [Twitter logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-twitter-login-for-discourse/13395)\n* [Facebook logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-facebook-login-for-discourse/13394)\n* [GitHub logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-github-login-for-discourse/13745)\n\nYou can also [set up single-sign on](https://meta.discourse.org/t/13045), or even [build your own login method](https://meta.discourse.org/t/14717).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-6\">6.6. Test Your Email</h3>\n\nEmail is required for new account signups and notifications. **Test your email to make sure it is configured correctly!**  Visit [the admin email settings](/admin/email), then enter an email address in the \"email address to test\" field and click <kbd>send test email</kbd>.\n\n* You got the test email? Great! **Read that email closely**, it has important email deliverability tips.\n\n* You didn't get the test email? This means your users probably aren't getting any signup or notification emails either.\n\n* Email deliverability can be hard. Read [**Email Service Configuration**](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-email.md).\n\nIf you'd like to enable *replying* to topics via email, [see this howto](https://meta.discourse.org/t/set-up-reply-via-email-support/14003).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-7\">6.7. Categories</h3>\n\nYou have three default categories:\n\n1. [Site Feedback](/category/site-feedback) \u2013 general discussion about the site itself. [It's important!](https://meta.discourse.org/t/5249)\n\n2. [Lounge](/category/lounge) \u2013 a perk for users at trust level 3 and higher\n\n3. [Staff](/category/staff) \u2013 visible only to staff (admins and moderators)\n\n**Don't create too many initial categories**, as you can overwhelm your audience. You can always add more categories, and easily bulk recategorize topics later. It's better to figure out the organization as you go rather than assuming you'll get it all right from the beginning (hint: you won't).\n\nTo add a category, visit the [categories page](/categories), then click Create Category at the upper right. You can set security per-category so only certain groups of users can see topics in that category.\n\nEvery category has an initial \"About this category\" topic. This topic will be pinned to the top of the category, and the description you enter will be used in a bunch of places. Be sure to give your new category a good, clear description, so people understand what belongs there!\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-8\">6.8. Pinned Topics and Banners</h3>\n\nNote that pinning topics does work a little differently in Discourse:\n\n* Once someone reads to the bottom of a pinned topic, it is automatically unpinned for them specifically. They can change this via the personal pin controls at the bottom of the topic.\n\n* When staff pins a topic, they can pin it globally to all topic lists, or just within its category.\n\nIf a pin isn't visible enough, you can also turn one single topic into a **banner**. The banner topic floats on top of all topics and all primary pages. Users can permanently dismiss this floating banner by clicking the \u00d7 in the upper right corner.\n\nTo make (or remove) a pin or a banner, use the admin wrench at the top right or bottom of the topic.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-9\">6.9. New User Sandbox and the Trust System</h3>\n\nIf your discussion area is be open to the public, new visitors will arrive that are initially strangers to the community. Discourse has a [trust system](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/2) where users can, over time, earn the trust of the community and gain abilities to assist in governing their community.\n\nDiscourse is designed to offer safe defaults for public communities, even with no active moderation.\n\n&gt; **0 (new) \u2192 1 (basic) \u2192 2 (member) \u2192 3 (regular) \u2192 4 (leader)**\n\nAll new users start out in a sandbox with restrictions for everyone's safety. **Trust level 0 (new) users _cannot_** \u2026\n\n* post more than 2 hyperlinks\n\n* post any images or file attachments\n\n* send private messages\n\n* flag posts or topics\n\n* have actual links in the \"about me\" field of their profile\n\n* @name mention more than 2 users in a post\n\nEvery action a user can take is rate limited for safety, and especially so for new users. But don't worry, new users can [transition to trust level 1](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/2) in about 10 minutes of reading.\n\nThese defaults are safe, but note that while in \"bootstrap mode\" after you set up your site, all new users will be granted trust level 1 until you reach 50 users.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-10\">6.10. Sending Invitations</h3>\n\nOne way to get people to visit your site is to invite them via email. You can do this via:\n\n* The Invite button at the bottom of the topic.\n\n* The Invite area on your profile page.\n\nThe invite area on your profile page also includes advanced Staff methods of [sending bulk invites](https://meta.discourse.org/t/sending-bulk-user-invites/16468), and [inviting users into groups](https://meta.discourse.org/t/invite-individual-users-to-a-group/15544).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-11\">6.11. Maintenance</h3>\n\n* One CPU and 1GB of memory, with swap, is the minimum for a basic Discourse community. As your community grows you may need more memory or CPU resources.\n\n* [Our Docker container install](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) is the only one we officially support. It guarantees easy updates, and all recommended optimizations from the Discourse team.\n\n* You should get an email notification when new versions of Discourse are released. To update your instance via our easy one click upgrade process, visit [/admin/upgrade](/admin/upgrade).\n\n* Some other things you might eventually want to set up:\n\n    * [Automatic daily backups](https://meta.discourse.org/t/14855)\n\n    * [HTTPS support](https://meta.discourse.org/t/13847)\n\n    * [Content Delivery Network support](https://meta.discourse.org/t/14857)\n\n    * [Reply via Email](https://meta.discourse.org/t/14003)\n\n    * [Import and Export your data](https://meta.discourse.org/t/15721)\n\n    * [Change the domain name](https://meta.discourse.org/t/16098)\n\n    * [Multiple Discourse instances on the same server](https://meta.discourse.org/t/14084)\n\n    * [Import old content from vBulletin, PHPbb, Vanilla, Drupal, BBPress, etc.](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/tree/master/script/import_scripts)\n\n    * A firewall on your server? [Configure firewall](https://meta.discourse.org/t/20584)\n\n    * A user friendly [offline page when rebuilding or upgrading?](https://meta.discourse.org/t/45238)\n\n    * Embed Discourse [in your WordPress install](https://github.com/discourse/wp-discourse), or [on your static HTML site](http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding-discourse.html)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-12\">6.12. Need more Help?</h3>\n\nFor more assistance on configuring and running your Discourse forum, see [meta.discourse.org](http://meta.discourse.org). In particular, documentation is kept there in the [howto category](https://meta.discourse.org/c/howto), and especially relevant howtos from there include:\n\n* [Discourse moderation guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/63116), explaining all the tools available to moderators and how to use them wisely", "created_at": "2017-08-05 18:04:10.693163", "updated_at": "2020-12-19 17:37:53.403190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10650, "wiki": true, "reads": 45, "score": 14754.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [43081, 40736, 10], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 4, 5, 6107, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31909, "user_id": 1543, "topic_id": 5108, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>finally catching up</b>\n\nHi everybody,\n\n\u00a0 I finally took some time to start looking at wikipedia datamining, statviews, etc.\n\nI'm still far from doing anything fancy, but at least I'm getting an idea of what can be done easily, and how to use the info collected.\n\nI'm focusing on python only, for now, because I'm more familiar with it (<a href=\"/u/dora\">@dora</a> too), and because it could be an easy win, in case the data collected is to be managed via networkx and/or passed to EdgeSense.\n\n<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, <a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>, <a href=\"/u/mstn\">@mstn</a>, <a href=\"/u/maxlath\">@maxlath</a>,<a href=\"/u/danohu\"> @danohu</a>, thank you all for the hints you shared.

With this new programmatic technology that allowed each and every ad impression and user to be individually scrutinized and targeted, that power was shifting inexorably from the publisher, the owner of the eyeballs, to the advertiser, the person buying them.  If my advertiser data about what you bought and browsed in the past was more important than publisher data like the fact that you were on Yahoo Autos right then, or that you were a (supposedly) thirty-five year old male in Ohio, then the power was mine as the advertiser to determine price and desirability of media, not the publisher's.  As it turned out, this \"first party\" advertiser data - the data that companies like Amazon know about you - is more valuable than any publisher data.\n>\n>This was a seismic shift that would affect everything about how we consume media, leaving publishers essentially powerless and at the service of the various middlemen between them and advertiser dollars, all in the name of targeting and accountability.  If the publisher wasn't savvy enough to arm itself with sophisticated targeting and tracking before tangling with the media-buying world, then that world would come to them, in the form of countless arbitrageurs and data quacks peddling media snake oil.  Which is why even august publishers like the _New York Times_ live at the pleasure of the media supply-side technology, data management solutions, and advertiser technologies that ostensibly pay them.

This system, called System Risk Indication (SyRI), pools together data from various government agencies to calculate the likelihood of committing welfare or tax fraud. The UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights has described governments\u2019 use of similar systems as \u201c[digital welfare states](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A_74_48037_AdvanceUneditedVersion.docx)\u201d and condemned them for their lack of transparency and oversight, and discriminatory impacts.

Earlier this year, the Dutch court found SyRI to be unlawful and ordered its immediate halt.

I am a bit overwhelmed by other nasty things. I hope to find some time maybe during this weekend.\n\nThe general idea was the following:\n\n1. Fetch medical terms (aka page titles in English) from the Wikipedia project on Medicine. Each term is stored in MongoDB in this form. wikidata field is taken from wikidata by title\u00a0<span>\"1971 Iraq poison grain disaster\" (step 2). locales field is fetched from wikidata using max's tool 'fetch by OpenData ID' (step 3). Hours field is calculated using pagecounts (step 4).</span>\n\n{ \"_id\" : INTERNAL_ID,\u00a0<span>\"day\" : ISODate(\"2015-11-30T23:00:00Z\"), \"wikidata\" : { \"pageid\" : 4094969, \"ns\" : 0, \"title\" : \"Q4284220\", \"lastrevid\" : 248156717, \"modified\" : \"2015-09-06T00:45:47Z\", \"type\" : \"item\", \"id\" : \"Q4284220\" }, \"locales\" : { \"en\" : { \"title\" : \"1971 Iraq poison grain disaster\", </span>\"hours\" : { \"0\" : 0, \"1\" : 0, \"2\" : 0, \"3\" : 0, \"4\" : 0, \"5\" : 0, \"6\" : 0, \"7\" : 0, \"8\" : 0, \"9\" : 0, \"10\" : 0, \"11\" : 0, \"12\" : 0, \"13\" : 0, \"14\" : 0, \"15\" : 0, \"16\" : 0, \"17\" : 0, \"18\" : 0, \"19\" : 0, \"20\" : 0, \"21\" : 0, \"22\" : 0, \"23\" : 0 }<span>\u00a0}, \"es\" : { \"title\" : \"Desastre del grano envenenado de 1971 en Iraq\" }, \"ru\" : { \"title\" : \"\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0432 \u0418\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435 (1971)\" } } }</span>\n\n2. For each term find OpenData ID from page title. I built the request by hand without max's tool (but what I do is what the new functionality of max's tool does).\u00a0\n\n3. For each term with a known OD Id fetch OpenData details. In this way we are able to find titles for the same page in other languages. Of course, some languages could be missing. For example, there is no Italian entry for\u00a0<span>\"1971 Iraq poison grain disaster\".</span>\n\n4. Dump pagecount data and update corresponding entries in MongoDB with count information (only for medical terms).\n\nAll steps are implemented, but for (3) I am running out of memory and I need another smarter way to do it. I should split the pagecount file into several batches or preprocess terms we are interested in before.\n\nThe algorithm could be generalised in such a way that pagecounts and terms are updated automatically.\u00a0\n\nI use MongoDB to store (partial) results. Firstly, I need to store partial results somewhere because I can't process the whole thing in a single step and MongoDB is better than files. Then I was going to build a webapp backed with MongoDB with a sort of simulator of Wikipedia hits.\u00a0\n\nI do not know if this could help for now. I will back soon with the code.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-14 12:31:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.028377", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 537, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45473, "user_id": 932, "topic_id": 8035, "post_number": 5, "raw": "quick response (sorry but it's hectic days here with a project I'm working on going in production this week :( ):\n\nI did not install the server part, that is the one implementing the APIs at all but rather use the server where it is already installed.

Is it thousands?\n\nIn my mind, this also depends on the network. My own network, both online (facebook, and twitter, maybe linkedin but the latter are really initiating to grow) and offline consists of about 50 people with whom I constantly stay in touch.. and follow their feeds.\n\nFor me staying within a hundred on FB was what I intended because for a long time (I signed up mid 2009, after true resistance) I thought of it as a network for friends, particularly those that are abroad.

In my opinion tourism will always play an important role of the country's economy and structure of population and even better, it will always evolve! Combining our experiences might answer many questions we all have regarding the subject, looking forward to that.\u00a0\n\nWhat an amenity is often related to properties, as in what makes the property extra desirable. This may be the case of an extra bed-room but also a nice backyard, though many people, like me, interpret it a bit wider. In this sense, amenities for us are the beautiful nature, animals and extra services that we offer on the farm. Most of these are things that you cannot experience in the cities.\u00a0\n\nSeasonality is also a matter of aspect. For us the high season is of course the summertime but just because winter sets in, people don't want to stop experiencing. It is just a matter of adjustment and fit the change of demand, for example laying down cross-country ski tracks or offer conferences and teambuilding.\n\nRegarding eco-tourism it is not only about leaving minimal footprints in the nature but also the learning experience. If the client can go home with a feeling of great experience that did not come of the cost of mother nature but also learnt from it, then in my opinion you are doing it right. Not only exploit what is there but also give something back!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWow, i'm rambling on haha.

We are struggling to bring money into the commons - because we are trying to make this work outside of the subsidized world.  \n\nAnother point / question is the fact that we are working on developing some \"common coins\" as a way to give back to those who are putting in a lot of work in our organization as incentives to continue to work as a commons.

They work on a monetary exchange free system after a paid registration. Everything is paid for in G. You can earn G's in different ways from participating in a collective workcamp or bringing materials to the recycloth\u00e8que. They are part of the Communa network of occupants.\n\nNone of us at artist commons have much knowledge of how many of these things work (really anything outside of art) or what  other ways we can bring some revenue into the commons to stay afloat. Things are working, but we do not want to start cutting corners to continue our project.\n\nA goal of ours is to have the artist commons be able to hire / pay it's artists not only for their projects but for all the work we have to do within the organization.

It' been really interesting to follow everyone's discussion in this thread around advertising and the attention economy as the Internet's business model and how it exacerbates surveillance and information capitalism. \n\nJust saw that this year's Mozilla Fellows Harriet Kingaby and Frederike Kaltheunejust published a policy brief on this very topic so thought I'd share: \"[Ad break: The Race to regulate digital advertising and fix online spaces](https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Ad_Break_for_Europe_FINAL_online.pdf)\" If you want a quick outline, you can check out [summary Twitter thread here](https://twitter.com/F_Kaltheuner/status/1313409790652100611?s=20). \n\nThought I'd share a small bit from the executive summary for the policy nerds in the group: \n\n> In this policy brief, we will argue that digital advertising \u2013 the business model that underpins most of the internet as we know it today \u2013 fails to support or sustain healthy digital spaces that are fit for purpose for the majority of people. The nature of contemporary digital advertising and its practices are at the core of some of the most pressing challenges facing societies today, from widespread and routine invasions of consumer protection and fundamental rights, to the funding of hate and misinformation. As a result, Europe\u2019s chance at forging its own vision for the digital world hinges on its ability to regulate and ultimately fix an industry that has become unsustainable, especially as we are moving towards a world of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) where online and offline environments become increasingly entwined. As it stands however, Europe lacks an overarching vision on how its digital strategy relates to online advertising. The Digital Services Act, the White Paper on AI, the Democracy Action Plan, the reform of the ePrivacy Direction, and the Commission\u2019s plans for enforcing competition in digital markets all address some aspects of the online advertising ecosystem. But there is a real risk that these separate initiatives will either lead to incoherent rules or that they will fail to address the core harms and risks associated with online advertising as we know it today. \n\nIf you have a moment to look at this, do these diagnoses and recommendations speak to your experience of navigating targeted advertising?", "created_at": "2020-10-06 10:55:01.791297", "updated_at": "2020-10-06 10:55:01.791297", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 383, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 61.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 5, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64546], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5025], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61667, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 11139, "post_number": 17, "raw": "It's ok, it can be here :)", "created_at": "2019-10-18 12:00:58.689295", "updated_at": "2019-10-18 12:00:58.689295", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61625], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18840, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1425, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>TNX</b>\n\nThanks for explaining it more :) Yet for some reason, I still have no good idea how it all works out on the social level, what motivates people to be part of it etc..

Admitting to myself and to my friends that I had a problem took a great deal of energy, but nothing compared to the procedure that dragged on for months before I was able to get treatment.\n\nAs a first contact, the university counsellor\u00a0was a good help. However, the number of appointments one\u00a0can have with them\u00a0is very limited. Getting a place in therapy is difficult. There are annoying regulations in order to get the insurance to cover it. I had to be rejected at 10 different therapists until I found someone who still had a space. I was lucky that we were a good match, but others search for a long time\u00a0until they\u00a0find someone they feel comfortable with.\n\nI saw\u00a0a doctor too, which did some tests to see that\u00a0there are no physical causes to my symptoms. And then some more tests. And of course, appointments were only to be had 6 weeks in advance. The same went for seeing a psychiatrist about medication.\u00a0\n\nWhen you are depressed and little things like getting out of bed take you a seemingly impossible amount of energy,\u00a0this effort is incredibly draining and frustrating. It seems like an insurmountable pile of hoops to jump through. There is this turning\u00a0point where you decide\u00a0that something needs to happen, that you need some kind of help <em>now</em>, because you don't know what to do anymore,\u00a0and then you are told that the next possible appointment is in 8 weeks.\u00a0\n\nWhat am I going to do until then? Is it possible to somehow\u00a0improve this process?

It was just too much of everything. Some of my friends have over a thousand, but they choose the use the platform in a slightly impersonal way, or have a much thicker skin than I and don't take online stuff so seriously.

I also find taking actual phone calls a little intimidating as I'm so used to typing an email.

Building a social innovation community to ensure knowledge sharing and transfer within a diversity of societal actors - from universities, to policy makers and to communities themselves, the latter providing the strongest signals as to where social change happens. This is a project typed Coordination and support, based on connecting existing actors, with opportunities to build bridges between them through innovative activities, such as bootstrapping a network of harmonious hackathons or unMonastery iterations.\n\nStatus: I had emailed Alberto Masetti Zannini couple weeks ago to ask if the Hub Network and their partners are decided yet on a consortium for the Social Innovation call in Horizon 2020, and he replied saying they're still in talks but no decision has been made, and he will get back to us as soon as possible.\n\n2. The Future of Care in the Hands of the Hackers: we are looking to deploy collective intelligence towards care using open-technologies wielded by hacking communities. This is a research and innovation typed action.\n\nStatus: \u00a0we are mounting a consortium as we speak, with partners from Politecnico Milano Design Dpt, LABRI, a Bordeaux university research institute, the Stockholm School of Economics, and the SCIMpulse Foundation in the Netherlands.\u00a0Once that is done (in a week or two) we will invite MT2019 as a test community if that is something they are interested in.

I saw it during her presentation at the Transmediale festival last year and it's even cooler irl:\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/22245808?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22245808\">*new* lumiBots documentation</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/meylean\">Mey Lean Kronemann</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.\n\nThe second in the the law of increasing returns which basically says has more gets more :)\n\nAnd finally, affecting change....any real change in the end comes down to affecting behavioral change. And that more information, more awareness more motivation do not necessarily lead to behavioral change....at least they are not the approaches I would take in trying to affect change.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://captology.stanford.edu/wp-content/plugins/spotlight-gallery/images/Fogg_Behavior_Model.gif\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\">\n\nWhich brings me back to feedback loops.\u00a0 Basically I've come to conclusion that If we want to affect change, we need to put outselves and other stakeholders into different feedback loops with our environments. And that this is where art and culture comes in for me. Not culture for then sake of free expression. No. Culture as a way of helping us interact with, affect and become affected by our social and physical environments in ways that lead to better outcomes for everyone.\n\nDoes any of this make sense to you?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-02 10:27:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.699371", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 335, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83750, "user_id": 5479, "topic_id": 14185, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Sounds good.

It&rsquo;s a building but it&rsquo;s important to bring in as many creatives as possible to give real value to the building. \n\nI am part of different communities, we are aiming to bring these different communities who could come up with new concepts together. We look at the success of Edgeryders bringing 5k users, we wanted to have something similar to catalyze the communities here and recognize their value. The online platform is called [TeaM2121](http://team2121.ro) - independent movement to help communities connect. To do so, we started with the mapping. Everyone is represented there with their profile, it can be used by anyone to find the creatives in Timisoara.\n\nPepe: one of the creators of Faber. The physical space can be limiting, but the virtual is not. How can we enjoy more the synergies in the creative hub? We decided to make an online map where you can map the community but also to collaborate and work on joint projects. \n\nAlex: Design principles and decisions we took: everything is modulable. The search bar and sort options, main exploration modules with eleven sectors with organized categories. By selecting the sector you see another module and categories = visual way of seeing the amount of people in each sector. You can go to the next level to see the people. By scrolling you go back to the categories. \n\nVal: the most useful is to see what type of creative work is most prominent in the town, type of interest. Our main role is to spot these things and bring in new resources to encourage more areas, looking in the international areas, spot what is missing in the city. We can do a lot with such a tool. \n\n**About Edgeryders as a global community platform:**\n\n![Where%20am%20I|690x395](upload://42kN3URv1fyWxePCsA6Oxr35ZSm.jpeg) \nPresentation in full is available [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1haomtcYeZU9aDshPTe8LmLdrfNtjHsgP/view?usp=sharing)\n\nAn open platform that supports people to interact, connect and collaborate on topics that they care the most about. \nWe are doing this because we see that \n1. collaboration is hard\n2. coordination is expensive\n\nWe are more than 5000 members working on Edgeryders projects and members individual projects. Why does it work and how YOU can use it:\n\n* Open sharing of stories =&gt; connection\n* Dense interactions &amp; information loops =&gt; emerging collective intelligence. You can map the people in a conversation, and also map the topics that they are talking about and the hidden connections between them.\n* Structured workspace =&gt; for example, we use it to organise participatory events where people meet each other before they meet in real life.\n* Personal and professional development =&gt; find your tribe, feel that you are not alone, fellowships, paid work, project collaborations.\n\n## Documentation and your photos are available here: http://bit.ly/TEHcommunitystory\n\n## What is your story?

I met @noemi  briefly at the [Open State of Politics Camp](http://openstate.cc/politics) in northern Germany and after the camp read [her article on the camp](https://edgeryders.eu/t/wir-bauen-zukunft-learning-from-a-community-with-3-kinds-of-showers/7127). This is how I found out about OpenVillage festival. I caught fire on the spot and was instantly keen on coming. So I dropped Noemi a message and now it's happening :slight_smile:\n\nA few words on my background: \n\nI'm born 1978 in Dresden, studied Math in Berlin, worked at a fairly large international company in the clinical research industry until I got super fed up by the top down management style and the general ethics in this field. I quit and then worked in Web Development and Graphics Design as a freelancer full time (I started this as a side project when I was studying) and helped developing the campaigning system of [campact](https://www.campact.de) - one of the larger German NGO's. \n\nAfter living abroad in Canada and Australia for a while I got on the natural building train, attended the [Earthship Academy](http://earthship.com/academy) in the States and after coming back to Berlin in 2013 founded the [Earthship Deutschland Network](http://earthship-deutschland.de) together with two fellow Earthship Lovers who I happened to meet in Berlin. After one year of networking and another winter down in Australia helping organizing natural building workshops with the [Agari Crew](http://agarifarm.org/) I got involved with the build of the [first German Earthship](http://earthship-tempelhof.de) at the community [Schloss Tempelhof](http://schloss-tempelhof.de). This is where the idea for the [Wir bauen Zukunft project](http://wirbauenzukunft.de) was born amongst participants of the quite amazing building workshop. That was end of 2015. Since I'm heavily involved with the development of the Wir bauen Zukunft project. I still work as a freelance Web Developer and Graphics Designer to rake in the money. Further more I organize and run natural building workshops and seminars together with Lale Rohrbeck under the label [down2earth](http://down2earth.org). We also teach at [Technical University Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/earthshipberlin).\n\nMy favourite topic is relationships. How do humans relate to each other? What is a healthy relationship? What role do dependencies play? From my perspective only through relating to other humans and/or to animals, plants, things we are able to evolve. To relate raises potential for growth in the form of challenge. We are challenged to overcome behavioral patterns through personal change, through lifting unconscious reactions to a conscious level in order make active decisions. Hence to relate is a means to be free. This - I think - is why building communities is so essential to move on from the century of self.\n\nOn the festival I'm happy to introduce the Wir bauen Zukunft project. A little rundown on the history of the project, where we at, why we are doing what we're doing and our vision. It would be a short presentation with Q&A. Let me know if that resonates with you and fits into your program.\n\nApart from that I would love to host a little workshop on how relationships foster our personal growth, employing the [Case Clinic method](https://www.presencing.com/tools/case-clinics) I learned during a [U.Lab](https://www.presencing.com/ulab/overview) Session two years ago. This will give the participants of the workshop the opportunity to learn about the Case Clinic format and about active listening apart from getting a better understanding of the nature of relationships. Let me know if that resonates with you.\n\nLooking forward to get to meet you all and to have a fantastic time at OpenVillage Festival :slight_smile:\n\nMuch love\nHenry", "created_at": "2017-10-12 16:50:18.229713", "updated_at": "2017-10-12 16:52:44.946200", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 643, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 193.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4101, 3, 3769, 4, 4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36544, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7144, "post_number": 3, "raw": "It's needed for reading and ethnographic coding.

Space arrangement <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\n### 2.1. Sleeping arrangement <a name=\"chap-2-1\"></a>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9db36ba638364818a6ccdb0e7c4bb978974c79ce.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\n* The 1st Floor contains 3 rooms, each can fit 2 person. a big living room can act as a good coworking space, shower , toilet and a kitchen. Plus a Big Terrace.\n\n* The ground floor has 3 separate studio apartments with a bathroom each, and we can use two of these. Each can hold around 3-4 persons.\n\n* A big terrace, nice roof with ocean view, swimming pool, a garden, and a non-functioning hamam :/ (it needs some work to be fixed).\n\n* The normal arrangement is 12 person where the women (6) can use the studios and men (6) can use the 1st floor. (This leaves 3 more spots to be filled sometimes.)\n\n\n### 2.2. Working arrangement <a name=\"chap-2-2\"></a>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f0208bc804ce5f53178b9ccaa0dc11e6edcb74a.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\nThe house could be adapted for several uses depending on the people inside. We have several options to transform the space to working spaces.\n\n1. **The big main living room.** This is considered the main coworking space. It is located in the 1st floor so for it is preferred for the ladies to use the studios downstairs for more privacy.\n\n2. **The big terrace.** Could be used as a semi outdoor working space. The space is easy to adapt as long as the weather is fine, just bring the chairs and table and you have a nice small space for a team. It is in the shade so you can work with laptops during the day with the pool and garden view.\n\n3. **The shaded outdoor space.** It is located behind the southern facade of the house, quite nice space for a working space or a workshop.\n\n4. **The space by the pool.** The space could be used as a coworking space; There is a shady place for a big table by the solar panels.\n\n5. **The roof.** When it is not windy, and still needs more shading to fit a space enough for a small group.\n\n\n## 3. Organization and timeline <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\nWe can use [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) and wikis here on edgeryders.eu for organizing the House and the projects happening in it, as follows:\n\n* This very document here is the main wiki for the House. It will list the main / strategic tasks for every month and we can and discuss them here in the comments section.\n\n* Here is [the dynalist](https://dynalist.io/d/8I41AdtRSel0ZFVKeNvovZzv) for all tasks (House and projects). It contains sub-lists for projects, for example the [coffee sorter dynalist](https://dynalist.io/d/HNW1DrMNCi6DTKCEL2LFi_uE).\n\n\n### 3.1. Plan for January <a name=\"chap-3-1\"></a>\n\nFor January 2018, out main tasks are the following:\n\n* During the first week (5-12 Jan) we need to prepare the house to fit our needs, meaning getting an internet connection, preparing the sleeping areas to be gender separated, and preparing the working area.\n\n* Getting to know the local community and find a carpenter who is willing to join the project or who is willing to allow us to rent/use his workshop and tools.\n\n* Then start working on the following projects (starting date 15th January): coffee sorter project, surf boards, storytelling / documentation.\n\n* Preparing to launch the Mesh network project by gathering the interested people from the local community and finalize the planning done in Riot including securing the equipment needed.\n\n### 3.2. January Summary<a name=\"chap-3-2\"></a>\n\n_To get a more in-depth summary please check the [January summary post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/openvillage-in-sidi-kaouki-summary-january-2018/8044)_\n\n* The spaces, Internet are ready and waiting for people\n\n* no Carpenter but we got in touch with someone who has a CNC in Essaouira which we can rent. we asked for a 3d printer to be borrowed/rented from Casablanca but still no replay about this.\n\n* Some young people from the local community are happy to join our up coming activities regarding furniture and any other educational activity ( as sometimes it is fun to do something new especially here there is not much activities around ) Besides we can do something with the nearby school, either with kids, or a play ground wit bitcut or even connect it with the Internet. \n\n* No projects started yet, all are postponed to start in February due to flight arrangement and or visa processes.\n\n* the mesh network project took another turn to be made as an intensive 3 days workshop in the 1st week of Feb ( check @gregoiremarty [post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/essaouira-projects-documenting-independant-radio-initial-steps-feb-2018/7863/3) )  \n\n### 3.3. February plan <a name=\"chap-3-3\"></a>\n\n* The participants are arriving and we can start working on the projects, each project can coordinate internally using the dynlist and or other means of communication and report the documentation on the platform.\n\n* Start our experience with the peer to peer curriculum, cooking, cleaning, sports, games, movies....etc and have fun. \n\n## 4. Peer Learning Curriculum <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\nEvery academy has a curriculum, and so do we :grin: Our is different though, as it's all about sharing skills and knowledge we enjoy. Also, these are side activities beyond the typical project work, which is organized internally inside each project (but of course others are invited to join quite often).\n\nSo, edit this and add either (1) what you would teach if there's an interest or (2) what you would like to learn if there's a teacher. \n\n**Workshop proposals with a teacher:**\n\n1. **Bicycle repair and maintenance.** By @matthias. All the basics using bicycles from around for hands-on \"case studies\". You should be able to maintain your bicycle all by yourself afterwards, including brake and derailleur configuration, fixing a wobbly rim with a spoke key etc.. Don't expect anything fancy though, as we only have basic bicycles and basic tools so far. Two sessions around 2 hours each.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; _Interested to participate:_ @hazem  [add your username here] @alberto \n\n2. **Building a mobile broadband router.** By @matthias and [your-name-here?]. We will build a mobile broadband router to provide a backup Internet connection for the House. For that, we will use open source hardware and software as much as possible: a Raspberry Pi 3, Linux, a mobile broadband modem, and a self-made weatherproof enclosure and raised mount. One session of 4-6 hours, or two sessions of 2-3 hours each.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; _Interested to participate:_ @alex_levene @hazem @matteo_uguzzoni  [add your username here] @alberto \n\n3. **Linux installation party.** By @matthias and [your-name-here?]. You'll install and configure Lubuntu Linux on your notebook computer, but you can keep Windows as well. Includes introductions to the programs you need to replace typical Windows software: LibreOffice, Inkscape, GIMP etc.. 3 sessions of around 2 hours each.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; _Interested to participate:_ @hazem [add your username here] @alberto \n\n\n4. **Working with photo spheres.** By @matthias. A nice new feature with most recent smartphones, but it takes a bit of time to master it. This workshop shows ways to view the photo spheres on your own computer and online _independent of Google_ software or services. We'll also learn how to fix issues in the photo spheres with image processing software, and a hack that allows to capture a photosphere as normally with the Android camera app, but that processing the photos with open source software into a result with more than twice the resolution produced by Android. We'll all take some photo spheres and work with these, of course.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; _Interested to participate:_ @HadeerGhareeb [add your username here]\n\n5. **Alternative first aid without a kit.** By @HadeerGhareeb. It will be over a session for an hour.\n_Interested to participate:_ @matthias  @hazem @matteo_uguzzoni  [add your username here]\n\n    1. 10 min: Introduction and safety.\n    2. 20 min: Fixing a bone (arm / leg), theoretical and practical (ex. using tree branch, magazines / newspapers, jacket, belt, \u2026).\n    3. 20 min: Stop a bleeding / handle a burn, theoretical and practical (using ex. T-shirt, plastic rolls,\n \u2026).\n    4. 10 min: Handling mild dehydration and heatstroke (ex. drinking 7up or Spirite to correct the electrolyte imbalance).\n\n\n**Workshop proposals without a teacher (so far):**\n\n1. **3D scanning with a camera.** We would experiment, learn and practice to create 360\u00b0 scans of objects using a smartphone photos, and sharing them as textured 3D objects online. We will use open source software as much as possible. Would be useful to document and share Bitcut results.\n\n\n## 5. Fun Activities  <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\n_If you have an idea of a fun or crazy activity that you want to make and need company_\n\n1. **Hiking to Essaouira**\nIt was mentioned (by a local person) that you can walk by the beach to from Kaouki to Essaouira. There are no barriers on the road. Would take around 5 - 6 hours; so if you are interested oin a long walk by the beach add your name and lets find a time to do so  \n_Interested to participate:_ @hazem, @matteo_uguzzoni [add your username here] @alberto \n\n2. **Playtest \"Invisible Cities\" board game**\n@matteo_uguzzoni \" I will bring with me a prototype I'm working on, is a tabletop game for 4 > 6 participant but in its simplest form could become a game for 12 people.

The projects that I\u2019ve participated and the fact that I was taking part of an NGO of young people helped me a lot in my personal development and in the accomplishment of my goals. I participated at very interesting contests such as: la Chasse au tresor, Junior Commercial, conferences, projects about democracy and European integration in Moldova, Romania, Hungary, France.\n\nSo I decided to go on.

But not. I am an average guy who lost his lifetime material achievements, I am bankrupt, jobless and homeless - I just happened to become activist instead. So who TF am I to judge others?\n\nHowever, my proposal is based on two considerations:\n\n1. I am talking about people who at least TRIED to do something - and this is already outstanding. Speaking of those who I met at the gala. One of them is working with Gypsy kids, painting grafitti at the social houses' walls \"Poland for everyone\". Another is a countryside housewife, making rainwater harvest systems due to local water problems. A handful of hipsters formed a food cooperative and now they are promoting Community Supported Agriculture around Warsaw. Etc. Etc. There is a lot of others who I would not meet, because they never get shortlisted - who knows why. And even if they are not people I would personally work with - just because I am old, grumpy and short-fused - they at least TRY. And to me - it is enough to try, too.\n\n2.\u00a0 I can hardly wait for our community discussion, to see if the 'telegraphist' model will be accepted. Someone coined the telegraph metaphore while discussing the software platform needs and I like it. We are in the position to become nodes of a social backbone, linking thousands of street-wise activists who are too busy doing real job. We can support them with the networked knowlede of others, and help them to gain strenght from the net.\n\nOne of the most amusing workshops I am usually running on various gatherings is \"Social solving of technical problems\". It is a freestyle mix of formal braistorming and circle driven, goal oriented consensus decision making. Give me a handful of random people, a shared problem to be solved and you will see miracles at work. :-) We can try this in Bru - for a small group it needs less than 2 hrs.\n\nAnyway, this is a sort of synergy I hope we may bring to activists throughout Europe.

Edgeryders-the-company is meant as a shared infrastructure for people to do meaningful work.\"Meaningful\" is defined by each person for themselves, with only a minimum of oversight to make sure personal choices do not mar the common brand. So, you could do Edgeryders dog sitting, Edgeryders space exploration or Edgeryders coffee trading (this last is in fact being tried), but not Edgeryders antipersonnel landmines. This is all predicated on maximising **personal freedom**. Over the years, as we grew personally closer to each other, we also developed an element of **solidarity** (\"creating prosperity for each other\"). The idea is to reduce the risks associated to all this freedom by pooling our activity: my  idea might tank, but hopefully I can still make a living by working on your more successful project while I get back on my feet. Solidarity and risk pooling implies greater coordination, and potentially some extra constraint onto personal freedom.\n\nEdgeryders architecture consists of an [online community](https://edgeryders.eu/about-us) and a [company](https://edgeryders.eu/our-company) living in symbiosis. The community is a place for free exchange of information and some cognitive collaboration; it is often where new ideas and projects emerge. The company is the place for delivery, and the economic and legal interface between the community and the rest of the world. \n\nAll this happens in a world with a given legal order. We do not challenge it directly, rather we seek to use it for our own purposes. In order to have a functioning legal infrastructure (sign contracts, bid for tenders, submit funding applications) [we created an Estonian private limited company](https://edgeryders.eu/t/moving-to-estonia-introducing-edgeryders-osauhing/6296). This move enables all these things, but subjects our decisions to Estonian and European company law. For example, the company's shareholders' annual general meeting  _must_ make decisions by majority vote (\"one dollar of capital conferred, one vote\"). While shareholders can and do choose other methods to make decisions, in the end a vote must be held, and votes must be counted for the decision to have legal force.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Principles</h2>\n\n1. **Who does the work calls the shots**. Edgeryders is a do-ocracy, rather than a democracy. If people want to do something and they have the energy and resources for it, they do not need permission, and they get to choose which things are done, and how. No one who is not personally involved in doing something has the right to tell those who are how to do it, within the limits of the law (you cannot charge clients without issuing an invoice, that's illegal) and of the good functioning of the common infrastructure (the invoice needs to be recorded on our accounting software, otherwise you'll break our system). As a consequence, we never vote on projects, we only check that they don't break the law nor our infrastructure.\n\n2. **No plan is the plan**. Our values make Edgeryders a _very_ decentralized organization. The company has no overarching strategy, just values and principles for collaboration. All the intentionality is at the level of the projects: the company can be interpreted as a federation of sovereign projects.\n\n3. **Project sovereignty**.  Sovereignty means that the person or group running the project is responsible for its financing (it has to find the client or backer), and it gets to allocate the project's budget, with no interference from the board. Every Edgeryders project contributes to the common resources with 20% of its budget, and disposes of the remaining 80%. \n\n4. **Teams**. The absence of an overarching strategy has a negative consequence: you might end up going from project to project, without a real professional development trajectory and with a high risk of \"getting lost\". So we try to work in small teams of twos and threes. Teams give themselves goals, and their members help each other stay on track. Teams also allow for a division of labour: it may not be efficient that we all become salespeople, but neither is it fair (or resilient) that only one or two people are responsible for dealmaking. So, we try to put financial and operational autonomy at the level of the team, rather than at that of the individual or that of the whole company.\n\n5. **Mutual support**. Project leaders are encouraged to offer each other paid, meaningful, fun work in each other's projects. This custom does two things: it encourages people to come together in a tighter web of collaboration and it adds to our individual resilience, because everyone is looking for (good) work for everyone else. Normally, the core members of Edgeryders get first ask on paid work procured by other core members (provided they have the right skills, of course). \n\n6. **Working out loud (and in writing)**. We communicate by being transparent, and letting each person decide which information she wants. This means we do not send each other emails (strongly discouraged within the company, a necessary evil when dealing with the outside world). Almost our entire workflow happens in writing on the company's online workspace. This way, everything is written down, has a URL and is searchable. For short-lived communications (\"Have you paid XYZ's invoice?\") it's OK to use the [Matrix](https://edgeryders.eu/t/green-book-matrix-and-riot-manual/6430/21), but anything substantial needs to be on this platform to be findable and open. Company directors and collaborators also have access to our accounting platform, which ensures financial transparency. \n\n7. **You are responsible for staying in the loop, not for keeping others in the loop**. Once you have documented what you do on the platform, you're good. No one can accuse you of being untransparent or not keeping them in the loop. We do this because we value doers and their work. Doing more does, in Edgeryders, come with a responsibility of documenting what you do, but no more. Once the documentation is there, no one is allowed to claim ignorance of it as a way to accuse the doer of not being proactive enough in communicating. This is a way to protect doers from vetoes or sniping from non-doers. If you want to be informed on a project, read upon it. It's all there. For example, you can set to \"tracking\" the relevant categories and topics on the platform.\n\n8. **Administrative minimalism**. We recognize the need for tidy process, especially at the low level. At the same time, we are strongly averse to useless paperwork, and determined not to have anyone doing the [bullshit job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) of creating administrative processes for others. Admin work is almost always unpaid in Edgeryders, to make sure our incentives stay aligned with not having any beyond the bare minimum. As a consequence, we are extremely cautious in adopting new common tools or procedures, because each person needs to make her own adoption decision. Occasionally we decide to give something a try, and then we promise each other to use the tool faithfully for a short period and see if the promised benefits materialise.\n\n9. **The board stewards the common resources**. Edgeryders is formally run by a management board (Estonian: _juhatus_). In Edgeryders, the board stays away from day-by-day (because management sovereignty) and formulates no strategy (because no plan is the plan). What it does do is care for the common resources. It (a) *watches over the company's reputation*. This is done through the exclusive power of representation of the company, granted to each member of the board individually by Estonian company law. If someone tries to do something crazy or pernicious like making Edgeryders landmines, the board will simply refuse to sign the contract, and the company will never be legally implicated. (b) *It decides small financial investments into business development*; for example, the #research-network was funded by the board. (c) _It maintains the common services_ (hosting, accountant, banking, some software development for internal use...), making sure that people and teams in the company always have a functioning vehicle for their projects.\n\n10. **Festina lente.** (Latin: \"make haste slowly\"). Our system is very efficient, but it reacts badly to emergencies and \"I need it yesterday\". This is good. Designing the system around emergencies would just encourage us to be sloppy. Instead, we commit to respecting each other's work. Move well ahead of deadlines, and be considerate of other people's workflows. Never work on the day of the deadline; only exceptionally, and with abject apologies, ask others to adapt to your own emergencies. Remember that people have a right to refuse to act on others' lack of planning.", "created_at": "2018-06-05 10:50:46.394157", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 15:30:04.850700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1597, "wiki": false, "reads": 56, "score": 1558.2, "like_count": 16, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 3, 3826, 2569, 3811, 4357, 3904, 347, 8, 1935, 5, 104, 4631, 4022, 4809, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32893, "user_id": 196, "topic_id": 1839, "post_number": 30, "raw": "<b>Here we are ;)</b>\n\nHey Rita!\n\nYou're right we should make some progress but we are working on it.\n\n<a class=\"mentions mentions-3759\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"valentinabrogna\">@valentinabrogna</a> is going to write a post about the Pasta Party.\n\nWe are very busy in these days but we absolutely want to keep on working on this.\n\nIn the meanwhile, here are the notes of the hangout for you use, if needed:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3v0zphEumojzsPC6VGn7LzdKc_dNcU5v19hIvOvZp8/edit\n\nLET'S KEEP WORKING!", "created_at": "2013-09-09 16:35:22", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 09:59:13.564307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 102, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32838], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60614, "user_id": 5426, "topic_id": 10887, "post_number": 9, "raw": "@noemi I saw that one of my facebook \"friends\" was interested in the event and the topic seemed interesting so I checked it out.

Ideally, to build new projects together which can support all of us! Events are a big part of these conversations.\n\nAhead of the events, this is where we collect expressions of interest, your personal motivations, and why this matters for your community.\n\n## Step 1. Make sure you register for an event organised by Edgeryders where we can get to know you. \nYou can do it by filling out this form:\n\nhttps://tell.edgeryders.eu/14305\n\n## Step 2. Meet other participants here in the comments and join the conversation to help us better prepare for the events!\n\n\n## Step 3. Become an EdgeRyders partner and co-organiser of a webinar\n\n[details=\"Click here to read detailed information\"]\n\nThe Terms below are meant to give you an idea of the work following a partnership agreement. They will be adapted to reflect the expectations of all partners.\n Following the event, let's explore together how to partner up to co-host other events to explore a topic in depth together with the community. Here are some ideas and expectations to make the collaboration more concrete: \n\n**Your organisation would be responsible for:**\n\n* Task 1: **Launch Event Invitations** - targeted/ open calls in your own language. The event should aim to bring together people from your city and from other parts of your country to meet and share personal experiences on the event TOPIC. \nThink about the event program: what is an interactive format you will implement? who in your community is going to open the conversation? who in your team is going to take notes and ensure extensive documentation?\n\n* Tasks 2: **Engage 30 people from different backgrounds** in your village, town, city, country to register to the event and post an introduction about the event TOPIC on the [edgeryders.eu online community forum.](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/)\n\n  * Task 2.1: **Disseminate the invitation** and collaborate with the Edgeryders social media manager to do online promotion of the physical event.\n\n  * Task 2.2: **Collect participant registrations** using the process defined by the Edgeryders team. We  convert registration information into posts on edgeryders.eu authored by participants. Follow the process defined by the Edgeryders team for regular dissemination of participant-submitted posts, stories and discussions happening on the platform. Edgeryders will provide assistance with community management.\n\n  *  Further reading about how we do online engagement in Edgeryders - [POPREBEL Engagement Strategy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jo_4E9Q12bJwhLEKoCwf-eZmuVOXz0bk/view?usp=sharing). \n\n* Task 3: **Publish the program** and other relevant information about the event. Work together with the people who you have engaged to ensure that the event is interactive. Make sure everyone is kept informed and knows how they can contribute.\n\n* Task 4: **Host the event and make sure it is fully documented**, following the guidelines by the Edgeryders team. \n\n   * Task 4.1: Ensure participation of individuals from different socio-economic groups, educational levels, professions, ages, geographic locations\n\n  * Task 4.2: Ensure each participant submit their personal reflections in a written article no later than 1 week after the event. A good measure for active participation is: 1 personal story and 3 comments per participant.\n\n  * Task 4.3: Participate in the online discussions on the online form, starting by sharing your own answers to the questions, and reading and commenting on what others write.\n\n* Task 5: **Produce an engaging event report**: summary of what was discussed, photos and highlights from social media. Keep the participants list, their usernames and links to their platform contributions. They will be needed for your invoicing. \n\n* Task 6: Recommend two of the most active participants for entry in the **POPREBEL Exchange Program** that will happen in 2021. In the Exchange program, event participants with an ongoing project or research interest that is conducive to improving the situation in their local communities will be matched with a co-working, co-living or other event organisation in the Edgeryders network in a European country. Selected participants will be granted a fellowship to spend 1 week with the organisation and engage in deep learning. They will be mentored by the host organisation. The purpose of the exchange is to create a practical roadmap for improving an aspect of community life. The roadmap will act as a practical tool for the participant to accelerate their work upon returning to their country.  \n\n**Edgeryders is responsible for:**\n\n* Task 1: Make available all the information regarding POPREBEL background and previous stories on the event TOPIC(S).\n\n* Task 2: Ensure coordination of events across the Edgeryders network: collect input from organisers and produce weekly summaries to support all event organisers. \n\n* Task 3: Produce Participant Registration page for the event to ensure registrations are recorded on edgeryders.eu community forum.\n \n* Task 4: Disseminate the invitation and call for participation on the Edgeryders social media channels and its network of 6000 forum users.\n\n* Task 5: Community management: Welcome everyone who signs up to the platform, engages them to contribute, selects the best posts and threads from the platform and summarises them into weekly overviews.\n\n* Task 6: Produce guidelines for events documentation.  \n\n* Task 7: Produce guidelines about how organisers can perform open reporting online.\n\n* Task 8: Ensure fair remuneration of event organisers (as per the Contract to be signed).\n\n* Task 9: Coordinate the Exchange Program in 2021. Support event organisers with recruiting participants for the POPREBEL Exchange Program. Match participants with Edgeryders host organisations and onboard them.\n\n[/details]\n\n### How is this all financed?\n\nThis event is part of the POPREBEL initiative, funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 822682 from 2019-2021.

Extend the insecurity to the point of erasing all the names and organisations, etc.\n\nI try to imagine how much time and resources the erasing phase would take. <span><span>Is this really</span> <span>necessary</span><span>?</span></span> Where does it end? How does the processed data looks like? I am worried that a lot of it would become so altered that it would loose its substance.\n\nOf course, I'm not expert in such things! But there is a solution to general insecurity. I suppose that it could be tested for application to this context.\n\nA solution to lower the insecurity of the ego is modesty.\n\nUsually, the \"I\" does not like being taken down to a lower position. The \"I\" greatly protests.\n\nIt is possible to lower the ego to a humble position by <span>appreciating the richness of oneself.

It says it can work with Drupal's internationalization and localization modules, and it was recommended to also add the <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/lingotek\">Lingotek</a> translation management system. Together, these Drupal modules would enable to have multilingual versions of any Drupal content, based on fields. Translations can be contributed by machine translation, users with a special \"translator\" role, and any commercial translation agency working with the Lingotek API. The TMS would show and manage all the translation tasks.\n\nI know you once said, translation is a boring task that nobody wants to do. Ture, but now there would be some money in this project to pay bilingual content contributors from the countries of the exercise to also translate the content of those who are not bilingual. This could even be an added selling point, since that added cognitive processing of others' content could lead to deeper / improved discussion quality on the platform.\n\nThis proposal of course depends on how great the Lingotek solution is ... but it's seemingly the best thing available for Drupal, and has tools such as syncing tanslations after the original was updates, a translation memory etc.. Machine translation can be a starting point for editing it afterwards ... seems to be faster than pure human translation ...\n\nOne group or many: a group is largely a notification / cohesion mechanism, so it might make sense to set up groups per topic, not per country, also enabling cross-country collaborations.

Let's make it for the long haul!\n\nI am definitely up for mentoring or supporting the work - ideally by bringing in Edgeryders as a partner. Most of the experience and network connections I have have been birthed here, so it's only fair to give back. My preferred scenario now is that we (Edgeryders) host a coordination platform for NELIS, as I mentioned in the post - NELIS branded, and for all the global/local discussions.\n\nThat said, learning to coordinate with others is something people in a global network learn to do - to report back on what they're doing; to engage in offering feedback to others; even learning to ask for help from others takes an effort.. so we need some patience and handholding. But what kind of information sharing we focus on is a choice to make: if our goal is to see more local chapters being formed, we need to gauge where the roadblocks are for people.\nWe could start with documenting the process of building an LC - not just the legal aspects, but also what motivated local NELIS leaders to do that, how the LC will ensure livelihood- be sustainable and rewarding for those putting in the effort. Where would the financing come? If we understand how 1 LC manages to integrate these, we're a step farther..\n\nThen how we recruit and engage others is the next I think.. because the weight of carrying NELIS activities locally cannot fall on the same shoulders. It was said that an achievable goal is for each local team to recruit 3 more people - but they need to come on board in an environment which feels fun and full of sustainability stories.

Staying at home</h2>\n\nEdgeryders is a service company with minimal office facilities and no obligation of physical presence (no one has to commute). Our greenhouse gas emissions come from our use of computers and Internet and from business travel. It is safe to say that business travel accounts for the lion's share. This manual is meant to help us reduce these emissions, but may also offer inspirations for other organizations to do the same.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Do you really need to travel?</h3>\n\nIn general, we do not recommend you travel just to have meetings, exchange words or other information. Valid reasons to travel can include, however:\n\n* **Serendipity.** If you want to work closely with certain people and to spend time together without an agenda, bouncing ideas around as they come: that's something that is hard to replace with online tools, as it is a lot about having enough time together to catch mutual creative moments. Such a time would be a substantial investment; think two weeks or more of living close, not just of sitting in the same office.\n\n* **Study visits.** Spending a substantial amount of time in a different place to get to know a group, their problems, their way of working or a set of physical artifacts (let's say, architecture) can hardly be replaced with digital communication. Short study visits (say, less than a week) can often be replaced with video interviews, videos sent as documentation material and the like.\n\n* **Physical work.** Non-digital work cannot be performed through digital communication tools. Sometimes you can replace your involvement with somebody living closer to the target destination. Sometimes the work is not important enough as the only reason to travel. Sometimes you'll have to travel.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. How to avoid traveling</h3>\n\nYou can replace most meetings with a blend of conference calls, written interaction via this forum, and other asynchronous collaboration tools. We explore this topic in detail in its own manual:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual-draft/11263\n\nFor some people, nomadic living is also a possible way to avoid at least half of the traveling \u2013 namely the return journeys. Everyone with a place-independent job can technically do this. The challenge is usually how to square this with partnership and family. Traveling nomadically with your partner would have the same emissions as traveling solo but with a return journey. However, nomads also have much more time to travel so can choose a carbon-neutral mode of traveling, which is carbon neutral even when traveling with a partner (sailing ship or cargo ship, or even bicycle). Alternatively, if you can manage a long-distance relationship then a temporary nomad life (of some months at a time) might be for you.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Staying on the ground</h2>\n\n#### Why it matters\n\nAir travel entails much higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per kilometer than overland or sea travel:\n\n> In 2018, [global passenger aviation] CO\u2082 emissions totalled [\u2026] 744 Mt, for 8.2 trillion revenue passenger kilometres: an average fuel economy of 90.7 g/RPK CO\u2082 [\u2026] (**3.61 L/100 km** [\u2026] per passenger) [\u2026] For a comparison with ground transportation [\u2026] a Volvo bus 9700 averages **0.41 L/100 km** [\u2026] per seat for 63 seats. In highway travel an average auto has the potential for **1.61 L/100 km** [\u2026] per seat (assuming 4 seats)\n> \n> (source: [Wikipedia: Fuel economy in aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Example_values))\n\nIn addition, \"the [\u2026] IPCC estimated that aviation's total climate [heating] impact is some two to four times that of its direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions alone\" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_aviation#Total_climate_effects)).\n\nSo whenever possible, we propose to use surface travel.\n\n\n#### Multi-mode planning tools\n\n* **[Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com)** is a multi-mode journey planner. This is meant to be a connection research tool, informing you about the timetable regularities (\"every 2 hours two days a week\" etc.). For booking, it's a bit confusing as you have to select and book each leg of your journey separately. However, it is the best surface travel planner becuase: it covers train, bus and ferry connections all over the planet, shows an overlay map of all of these, and as the only tool also shows journeys on separate tickets (\"self-connected journeys\") such as combinations of privately operated coaches and public trains.\n\n* **[Omio](https://www.omio.com/)** (formerly GoEuro) runs simultaneous searches for trains, buses and flights. You can then pick your favorite travel mode by clicking on a tab. It includes ticket booking directly on the site. In practice, it does not seem to be particularly strong on finding train itineraries.\n\n* **[From A to B](https://www.fromatob.com/)** is a multi-mode journey planner for Germany. In Germany, it includes trains (incl. Flixtrain), buses and BlaBlaCar car pooling.\n\n   It is (so far) of limited use outside Germany beyond flight search, as it lacks lots of train timetables there. Also, it does not show journeys that need separate tickets, which makes it pretty useless as a multi-mode journey planner. For example, it will find single-ticket journeys that include Flixbus and Flixtrain, but not journeys that include Flixbus and Deutsche Bahn trains as these would be two separate tickets.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Trains</h3>\n\n#### Planning tools\n\nRail travel is relaxing and comfortable almost anywhere in Europe. Unfortunately, the degree of integration between the ticketing facilities of different railway companies is still limited \u2013 forget about the full interoperability of airlines. Despite this, the quality of intermediary services is growing rapidly.\n\n* (Also see above for multi-mode planning tools beyond \"just trains\".)\n\n* **[Rail Europe](https://raileurope.co.uk/)** (formerly Loco2) allows to plan and buy rail trips across multiple European countries. It has the most comprehensive coverage for a rail booking site so far (according to @alberto). Its timetable data come from Deutsche Bahn though, and it seems to not \"know more\" than the Deutsche Bahn website when it comes to just finding connections. It's also supposed to find bus connections, but that is probably limited to the UK.\n\n* **[Deutsche Bahn Reiseauskunft](https://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en)** can be used as a comprehensive search engine for all European rail connections. You can only book tickets there where at least one end is in Germany, though.\n\n* **[Railtic](https://railtic.com)** is a search engine: it can find train rides, but won't sell them to you.\n\n* **[The Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/)** makes you compare and book train and bus tickets for many railway companies in Europe, using your loyalty cards and buying tickets at (they say) even cheaper prices. @ilaria is happy with it.\n\nFor purchasing the actual tickets, Seat61 has a handy [guide to buying tickets for European trains online](https://www.seat61.com/Europe-train-tickets.htm#How%20to%20buy%20European%20train%20tickets%20online). Spoiler: it *really* matters who you buy from.\n\n\n#### Operators, fidelity programs\n\nThe reality of European rail travel is that each international trip will consist of several legs, each ran by different companies. There seems to be nothing comparable to Skyteam or Star Alliance in airlines. This leaves us with a maze of (national) railcards, rail passes, fidelity programs etc., in addition also many small non-national rail operators. There are some serious opportunities here. For now, we collect random tips in the section below :) \n\n* Deutsche Bahn issues [Bahncards](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/bahncard/bahncard.shtml) that look attractive if you are doing a lot of your travels in Germany.\n\n* [Flixtrain](https://www.flixtrain.com) is the sister company of Flixbus. It does not simply resell train seats, it actually runs a small network of its own trains, for now limited to some cities in Germany. It promises trains [running fully on renewable energy](https://www.flixtrain.com/company/renewable-energy).\n\n* [Avlo:](https://avlorenfe.com) Spanish low cost high-speed rail service launched in January 2020. It is run by the Spanish national railway company Renfe.\n\n\n#### Interrail\n\n[Interrail passes](https://www.seat61.com/InterRail-pass-guide.htm#What_is_an_InterRail_pass) are  promising. The international ones (\"Global Pass\") start at 257 EUR for 4 days that can be chosen flexibly within a month. Much more research is needed in this area. For now, here's a list of tips we found helpful regarding Interrail use.\n\n* **Coverage.** What is great about Interrail, is that the global pass also covers travel with several bus companies and ferries in Europe. In general, you will need to pay additional fees for travelling with high-speed trains like the TGV, or with any train that requires a seat reservation for \"normal\" passengers.\n\n* **Flexibility.** The great thing about Interrail is not just cost savings but the flexibility you get. For long international journeys, that kind of flexibility is required because \"something will go wrong\" and otherwise make your following train tickets worthless and a case of wasted money. You *can* get flexible tickets directly from train operators, but these would be *really* expensive then \u2013 for example, a single journey Frankfurt/Main \u2013 Catania is 300 EUR, making Interrail worth it just for these two travel days.\n\n    With Interrail, you are required to pay seat reservation fees (usually 10 EUR) for certain trains, but you can do that shortly before departure as it will always cost the same and trains are rarely fully booked. So you don't potentially waste money on these reservations compared to booking a super-saver normal ticket months in advance and then not being able to embark on that journay due to a delay of the previous train operator.\n\n* **Ticket delivery.** Tickets are delivered in paper form via DHL Express from a fulfillment center in Ireland, so it's pretty fast and reliable. Experiences: ticket ordered Monday 17:00, shipped Tuesday 16:00, received Wednesday 10:00 in central Germany. The official delivery time estimate given at the time of ordering was 8 days later.\n\n* **The Interrail app.** It allows you not only to plan your journey from A to B, but also to filter on routes covered by the Interrail pass, and on those not needing an additional reservation on top of the Interrail pass. This enables you to travel with trains that do not require any additional fees or administrative actions. Of course, that means that it might cost you a bit more time to arrive on your destination. You can however also opt to buy a reservation and go on high-speed / intercity trains.\n\n* **Unused travel days as a perk.** You can use Interrail as a perk for company staff: if you are traveling a lot in a given month and it makes sense to buy an Interrail pass rather than just tickets, you get to keep your Interrail pass when you are done with company-related travel. So, go ahead and take that holiday break, the train ticket is paid for!\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Buses</h3>\n\n**European bus travel.** Bus travel has upgraded a lot in Europe in recent years. You can now expect onboard toilets, good seats, wifi and power sockets, and bus service to most medium-sized cities. The landscape of bus travel is even more fragmented than that of rail travel. Some operators are micro companies that only offer one or two long-distance lines.\n\n* **[Flixbus](https://global.flixbus.com/)** is a German startup vying for dominance in Europe via subcontracting to many small companies. They have a good network centered on Germany, with destinations from Oslo to Paris, Milan and Kiev. Best coverage outside of Germany seems to be in the Netherlands and Central and Eastern Europe, but also extending down to Italy.\n\n    In the [Flixbus route map](https://global.flixbus.com/bus-routes), everything with 0 or 1 transfers is considered a \"connection\". Neither that map (after selecting your start location) nor the [Flixbus search](https://shop.flixbus.com/) will offer journeys with 2 or more transfers, but you can of course concatenate two journeys that you find separately. Also, there [seems](https://www.novo-monde.com/en/europe-bus-flixbus/) to be no overview map of *direct* Flixbus connections anywhere. That is however needed to find intermodal trips with low probabilities of delays by minimizing changeovers. The only option so far seems to be choosing a starting point and making guesses in the map which destinations will be direct or not, then checking in the search.\n\n    To travel even more cheaply with them, you can purchase [discounted Flixbus vouchers on eBay](https://www.ebay.de/sch/i.html?_nkw=flixbus+gutschein) \u2013 or sell your own there in case you don't need them. To keep your vouchers from expiring after 12 months, you can use them to purchase a trip an cancel it right afterwards, which results in a new voucher for the trip price less a 1 EUR cancellation fee.\n\n* **[BlaBlaBus](https://blablabus.com/)** is a new coach service set up by ridesharing platform BlaBlaCar. Provides bus connections within Europe.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Cars</h3>\n\n**Ride sharing platforms.** @nadia likes French startup [BlablaCar](https://www.blablacar.com/). They are the most widely used platform in most of Europe, esp. including Germany.\n\n**Hitchhiking.** Also of course, there is the age-old tradition of hitchhiking, and its widespread resurgence could save a lot of emissions. For those who want to try, see [Hitchwiki](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page), the hitchhiker's manual.\n\n**Car travel.** If you have to travel and there is no better option, then car travel is still better than flying if at least three people travel in an average car ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Example_values)). This means, offer your journey on ride sharing platforms to find co-travelers, or where this is impossible, use a very small car.\n\nThe choice of car matters. Electric cars would be great, but are not yet practical for all long journeys. There are other options as well. CNG powered cars produce 35% less CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger kilometer than petrol powered cars (assuming a 20% biogas portion, about average in Germany) ([source](https://www.erdgas.info/erdgas-mobil/alternative-kraftstoffe/vergleich-cng-und-lpg/vorteile-gegenueber-lpg/)). They can be considered climate neutral if fueled with 100% biogas, which is possible at ~150 fuel stations in Germany for example. For traveling alone, a small CNG car like Fiat Panda is suitable. For traveling with others via ride sharing portals, a minivan CNG car such as a [VW Caddy Maxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Caddy#Caddy_Maxi_and_Caddy_Maxi_Life) 7-seater is the most economic option, allowing comfortable travel with 6 people via ride-sharing platforms. At (approx.) 6.5 kg CNG/100km, such a setup would result in:\n\n(6.5 kg CNG/100 km \u00d7 [2.79 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg CNG](https://www.spritmonitor.de/de/berechnung_co2_ausstoss.html)) / 6 persons / 100 km = 30.2 g CO<sub>2</sub>/passenger km\n\nThis amounts to about a third of the 2018 global average values for air travel. Assuming an average 20% biogas, the fossil fuel portion is 24.2 g CO<sub>2</sub>/passenger km. That is *less* than the 32 g/passenger km for coach travel (assuming a utilization rate of 60%), currently considered the most climate friendly public transport option in Germany according to a study of the federal office for environmental affairs ([source](https://www.capital.de/wirtschaft-politik/treibhausgase-pkw-bus-bahn-und-flugzeug-70715); TODO: find and link the original source).\n\n**Rental cars.** If there is plain nothing on offer regarding public transport to travel between two intermediate destinations, a rental car can be a possible solution, as it can be handed back at a different station than the pickup station. It can also be cost-effective, as esp. in touristic areas in the off-season the offers are full of dumping prices, down to 50 EUR for 5 days. Take a car that is as small as possible of course, as these consume less fuel.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Ferries</h3>\n\nIn the Mediterranean Sea, there are numerous ferry connections and they are almost ridiculously cheap for foot passengers (for example Palermo \u2013 Tunis 13 EUR, Palermo \u2013 Genoa 52 EUR). Ferries are not in service because of foot passengers, these rather just fill up spots not taken by the passengers of transported cars and trucks, and some free deck space just because a ferry comes with a lot of space. So a ferry foot passenger is \"zero marginal emissions\": adding or removing all foot passenger does not change number of ferry journeys or their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in any way. That makes it a green way to travel, as long as cars are ferried around.\n\nThe advantage of a ferry is that you get one long trip instead of piecing together multiple train and bus journeys. That avoids missing connections due to delays and may even give you a full night of sleep. For example Palermo \u2013 Genoa is 20:30 hours by ferry, and 17-18 hours by bus and train if you don't miss a connection.\n\nSome tips for ferry travel as a foot passenger:\n\n* **If you want comfort, book a cabin bed.** Usually, 4-bed shared cabins are available, either inside-facing or outside-facing (with windows). The latter are more expensive.\n\n* **\"Deck space\" means camping.** At least with Grimaldi Lines, you don't have to reserve a seat and can instead use \"deck passage\". That's obviously the cheapest option, but it means you have to bring sleeping gear if you want to sleep. At night, people are literally just sleeping everywhere in the large common deck rooms. You do well to grab a space early on, as sometimes the boat will be so full that it's difficult to get a good sleeping spot if you wait too long. Also, the engines can be quite noisy and the lights will stay on in the deck spaces, so be sure to prepare for that if you want to sleep.\n\n* **How to do computer work.** There is no Internet (at reasonable cost) available during passage. You usually can get satellite Internet access via wifi, but that's only reasonable for very low bandwidth applications like plain text chat and e-mail. But you can totally do computer work that does not need it. try to be lucky and find a chair and a power outlet somewhere, for example in the staircases. These are well-loved by others for charging phones and often blocked. But if you bring a multi-plug that also includes four USB charging sockets, you'll certainly be able to get a power socket. People will also ask you to guard their device while it's charging. Otherwise, you can bring an external battery pack or replaceable notebook batteries for 10-12 hours of work.\n\nBooking ferry trips:\n\n* **Directly at the ferry line.** You can book tickets directly with the ferry line. Expect old-fashioned websites, and that payment systems may not work the way they should. In that case, Direct Ferries is another option (see below).\n\n* **[Direct Ferries](https://directferries.com/).** This is a platform to book tickets for multiple ferry lines in the Mediterranean Sea. It's a bit old-fashioned, but the tickets you get are valid (tested by @matthias).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. Experimental options</h3>\n\nThere are some more options for those ready to experiment or to innovate. Below we list what we find interesting, and it also includes some business ideas for entrepreneurs:\n\n* **Sleeper buses.** These are coach-size buses equipped with bunk beds or cabins for night accommodation. In principle, these could be the perfect complementary solution for trains, directly connecting cities not readily served by trains or where a train journey would take changeovers in the middle of the night etc.. They could even be used in line or charter service for comfortable multi-day journeys that replace longer flights. Assuming they have half the capacity of a regular coach, they would use 0.82 l/100 km of diesel fuel per passenger, still much better than airlines at 3.61 l/100 km (see: [Wikipedia: Fuel economy in aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Example_values)).\n\n    Sadly, these buses are only available for public transportation in India ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_bus#India)) plus [one company in the U.S.A.](https://www.ridecabin.com/), connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco. In Europe, they are often used by bands and available for charter for other uses; the economics of that option have to be investigated. [Flixbus operates night bus connections](https://global.flixbus.com/overnight-bus) with regular coach buses throughout Europe \u2013 means, you will not have a real bed to sleep in, just an inclined seat.\n\n* **Intercontinental bus travel.** This is not yet on offer for real but would be a suitable technological alternative for long-distance flights for any journey leg not including an ocean crossing. Without infrastructure investments, it would be an intermediate solution until the the issue that bogs long-distance surface travel down is solved (namely comfortable and dependable booking and travel, not the mess of carriers, delays, payment options etc. that we have today). Buses can even carry their own sleeping and cooking equipment, allowing to travel comfortably through very remote areas. The closest thing in existence is German \"moving hotel\" bus operator [Rotel Tours](https://www.rotel.de/) ([English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotel_Tours), [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotel_Tours)). They offered overland journeys from Europe to India earlier, but seemingly not anymore as of 2020. Potentially a whole bus could be chartered for a custom journey, but it would require at least 20 travelers for that.\n\n* **Freighter travel.** You travel aboard a commercial cargo ship. Rates are usually per day of travel and vary from 60 - 130 EUR. An example of an agency offering this type of journey is [Langsamreisen](https://www.langsamreisen.de/en/freightertravel/). If you find a way to directly agree on this with the shipping company, it will probably be much cheaper.\n\n* **Recreational boat travel.** This typical boat journey offer you can find at [Find a Crew](https://www.findacrew.net/en/boat/search) is by a middle-aged male captain, traveling for fun, anywhere in the world. You will have to help aboard as part of the crew, and in most cases are expected to contribute to harbor costs and food expenses etc.. There are no fixed dates of departure (\"it depends on the weather\") and mostly no fixed routes given, so when trying to use this as a mode of traveling it will really be stretching it. But you may be lucky, of course :slight_smile:\n\n* **Sailing cruise ships.** There is at least one large (26 passenger) sailing ship doing Atlantic crossings, in this case once per year in each direction: [the Chronos](https://www.langsamreisen.de/en/sailing-trips/atlantic-crossing/antigua-portugal/). One crossing Caribbean Sea to Portugal will take 26 days and cost 4600 EUR :astonished: \n\n* **Engine powered cruise ships are *not* an option.** Engine powered cruise ships are available in plenty to cross the oceans, and when knowing the tricks it can even be cheaper than living in a hotel. Some digital nomads do this as a way of living, and there is now even [Nomad Cruise](https://www.nomadcruise.com/) for them. However, their carbon emissions are worse than flying, and there are plenty of other pollution issues they cause. Numbers are hard to find, but here are some from [a 2006 Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/dec/20/cruises.green):\n\n    > \"According to our calculations, a cruiseliner such as Queen Mary 2 emits 0.43kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger mile, compared with 0.257kg for a long-haul flight (even allowing for the further damage of emissions being produced in the upper atmosphere). [\u2026]\"\n    > \n    > \"Travelling to New York and back on the [Queen Elizabeth 2] [\u2026] uses almost 7.6 times as much carbon as making the same journey by plane.\"\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-6\">2.6. Containment planning</h3>\n\nWhen dealing with international surface travel, you often have to use self-connected journeys, which means that the carrier will not refund your other tickets or unplanned overnight stays in case of delays. And delays are inevitable so just plan for them yourselves. Some hints:\n\n* **Sufficient changeover times.** For journey legs that are hard to calculate and could have significant delays (such as ferries), plan for sufficient changeover times of several hours right from the start.\n\n* **Minimizing connections.** Long journeys without a changeover cannot go wrong, making them preferable even if somewhat more expensive. This applies to long train journeys \u2013 look at a track map to find suitable ones. It also especially applies to ferry journeys as an alternative to trains and buses.\n\n* **Cancellation policies.** Any leg of your journey except the first should have a useful cancellation or ticket change policy. This might mean booking for a higher fare initially to have that flexibility. Here are some tips for different carriers:\n\n    * **Deutsche Bahn.** \"Super Sparpreis\" tickets cannot be cancelled or refunded. \"Sparpreis\" tickets can be cancelled up to and including on the calendar day before the first day of the ticket's validity, for a fee of 10 EUR. \"Flexpreis\" tickets can be cancelled free of charge up to and including on the calendar day before the first day of the ticket's validity, and refunded for at least 1 month after that for a fee of usually 19 EUR. ([Details](https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/buchung/stornierung/index.shtml).)\n\n        Recommendations: usually book \"Sparpreis\"; if the DB connection is late in the day and you don't know until that day if you can make it, better book \"Flexpreis\", esp. if it is not that much more expensive. Sometimes \"Flexpreis\" for international connections is up to five times as expensive as early-booked \"Sparpreis\" tickets, in which case booking two separate \"Sparpreis\" tickets can make sense, of which you then use one.\n\n     * **Flixbus.** You can cancel with a minimal fee (1 EUR) in the app or website up to 15 min before departure. An alternative Flixbus connection that you have to book short-term might be more expensive, so it can make sense to keep a \"free journey\" joker coupon ready for these cases.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-7\">2.7. Initiatives</h3>\n\n* [Flight-Free Travellers Network](https://www.facebook.com/groups/305252120374092/): Facebook group where you can find suggestions and support for traveling without taking a plane.\n\n* [#westayontheground](https://westayontheground.blogspot.com/): Swedish organisation that created the Flight Free 2020 campaign - groups in various countries:  [Belgium](https://www.flightfreebelgium.com/), [Sweden](http://vihallerosspajorden.blogspot.com/), [UK](https://www.flightfree.co.uk/), [Danmark](https://www.flyfri.dk/), [Germany](http://flightfree.de/), [France](http://restonslespiedssurterre.fr/), [Canada](http://flightfree.ca/). \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Flying thoughtfully</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. When can flying be the better option?</h3>\n\n**Flying plus over-compensating.** It is not at all clear for what kind of traveling flying together with [compensating](#heading--5) or over-compensating its emissions is the better way to travel, all factors considered. Flying is much harder to de-carbonize in the near future and uses more energy per passenger kilometer (is more wasteful) anyway, so ground transport is preferable, and if only to create a market demand for better and greener ground transport options in the future. The comfort and usually lower costs of flying are not proper reasons to fly \u2013 however, when the difference in cost is invested into over-compensating the emissions of flying, it's an open question up to what extent ground transport is really the better option. There will be a time when that cost difference is eliminated, but while it exists (and ground transport is as inadequate as today), perhaps a good rule of thumb is this:\n\n> \"When ground transport exceeds 24 hours of traveling, or when overnight transport is needed but no comfortable options is available, flying plus 8\u00d7 over-compensating the emissions is a suitable option.\"\n\nThis will still create and show market demand for continent-wide surface travel, incl. comfortable overnight traveling. At the same time, compensating the emissions 8 times ensures that even in the \"4 times the emisisons\" worst case scenario of the [total climate impact of aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_aviation#Total_climate_effects), the journey is a net benefit for the climate. Even better of course, invest the whole price difference between flying and surface travel into compensating emissions.\n\n**Example calculation.** A one-way journey Frankfurt \u2013 Catania (1487 km) means 134 kg of direct emissions per passenger (calculated [here](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx)). To compensate that 8 times over, 8 \u00d7 134 kg = 1072 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have to be offset. The cheapest option for surface travel is by coach (110 EUR). The cheapest and also lowest-emission option of flying is with RyanAir, at about 30 EUR. The 80 EUR difference can compensate up to 7.3 t of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using typical rates that start at 11 EUR/t. Investing the whole price difference into compensating emissions would compensate *54 times* the direct emissions of the flight, or 54/4 = 13 times the worst-case climate impact of that flight. So even when assuming that compensation schemes are not nearly as effective as they claim to be etc., there will be a lot of net benefit left.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Low-emission flying</h3>\n\nWhen it comes to flying, not all flights are the same in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. This and how to choose flights wisely in practice deserves more analysis, but here are a few pointers already:\n\n* **Fly as short as possible.** Even if it is not practically possible to use surface travel for all of your trip, you can at least minimize the part of the trip done by airplane. The lower limit will be the ocean crossing, usually. For example, you could fly Lisbon \u2013 New York ([5432 km](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+between+Lisbon+and+New+York)) rather than Berlin \u2013 Los Angeles ([9341 km](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+between+Berlin+and+Los+Angeles)), saving 42% of air travel. Dublin \u2013 New York is similar ([5129 km](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+between+Dublin+and+New+York)), saving 45%.\n\n    A great tool to find short flight connections is [flightconnections.com](https://www.flightconnections.com/). When you have some good candidate airports, you check their exact distances with Wolfram Alpha with queries as in the examples above. That makes sense as usual maps do not provide a good visual sense of distance due to distortions inherent in the map projection.\n\n* **Choose a fuel-efficient airline.** Because, there are vast differences in the fuel economy between airlines due to airplane fleet and seat density:\n\n    > In 2014, MSCI ranked Ryanair as the lowest-emissions-intensity airline [\u2026] with 75 g CO<sub>2</sub>-e/revenue passenger kilometre \u2013 below Easyjet at 82 g, the average at 123 g and Lufthansa at 132 g \u2013 by using high-density 189-seat Boeing 737-800s.\n    > \n    > (source: [Wikipedia: Fuel economy in aircraft \u00a7 Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Airlines))\n\n    From that example, flying with RyanAir compared to an \"average\" airline would reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the flight already by 1-(75/123) = 39%. They are called \"economy airlines\" for a reason \u2026\n\n* **Avoid too short and too long flight legs.** Very short (<2000 km) flights or flight legs have a bad fuel economy due to the high fuel consumption during ascent. Likewise, very long (>5000 - 6000 km) flights or flight legs start to become less fuel efficient due to the added weight of the fuel for the whole flight. Then, it makes sense to make a stop to re-fuel ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Flight_distance)). (TODO: good numbers for different flight lengths and aircraft types)\n\n* **Fly light.** This makes some limited sense: for example on a 4,600 km flight, each kilogram of added weight consumes 15% of its weight in fuel, producing roughly 45% of its weight in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:\n\n    > Airbus presented the following measures to save fuel, in its example of an A330 flying [\u2026] 4,600 km [\u2026]: [\u2026] 100 litres [\u2026] of unused potable water consumes 15 kg [\u2026] more fuel.\n    > \n    > (Source: [Wikipedia: Fuel economy in aircraft \u00a7 Procedures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Procedures))\n\n    So the 50 kg difference of sending a more lightweight colleague to fly, who then also flies without baggage, would save 22.5 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Compared to the total emissions of the flight of about 289 kg ([source](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx), for BKK\u00ad\u2013HND) that's a maximum achievable saving of ~8%.\n\n* Turboprop engines are more fuel efficient than the usual turbofan engines ([see](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/48222)), but they are not used at all on intercontinental flights, the only ones that usually cannot be replaced by ground transportation.\n\n* Some airlines may already use significant portions of [sustainable aviation fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_aviation_fuel). That's not sustainable of course, but better than nothing.\n\n* [Wikipedia: Environmental impact of aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_aviation)\n\n* [Wikipedia: Fuel economy in aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft)\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Making the most of your journey</h2>\n\nTravel time does not have to be a \"dead zone\". You can and should reclaim that time to work, play or reach out to your loved ones. This is much easier when traveling overland, without the annoying interruptions of air travel. In Edgeryders, we commit to not making trouble paying you for work done while on the road.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Before your trip: planning well</h3>\n\nIf you do have to travel, we recommend you spend some time planning your trip carefully:\n\n* **Merge your trips.** @alberto believes in \"merging\" trips: if you can, schedule your trip so that you go from destination B directly to destination C. This way, you can cover two destinations with only three legs of your journey, instead of four (two there-and-back journeys). This generalizes even better to more than two destinations.\n\n* **Travel together.** By taking a colleague or friend with you on your travels, you transform hard-to-use travel time into important facetime for socializing and / or business purposes. It's much more fun, cheaper (by sharing a room), easier (by sharing the coordination effort) and safer (by having an experienced colleague or at least another pair of eyes and ears if something goes wrong). Because it's more fun, it can make strenuous journeys such as a multi-day boat or train journey acceptable. Of course, to make this possible you'll have to start planning early: when selecting the people to work on a project resp. to go to a certain event.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. On the road: a kit for pleasant and productive trips</h3>\n\nExperienced travelers have many tips and tricks for making the most of the long hours you will spend on the road. \n\n* A noise canceling headphones set eliminates the hum of the road. This helps you feel more rested, and is especially good if you want to sleep.\n\n* A travel pillow can be a great help if you want to sleep.\n\n* Make sure you pack power banks not to run out of juice (though most trains and buses in Europe nowadays offer power sockets). Always take an international power adapter with you, it can save a lot of frustration!\n\n* If you plan to do a lot of writing, you can improve your writing posture and comfort even without an external monitor. [The Roost](https://www.therooststand.com/) holds your laptop screen at eye level, and an external keyboard helps you maintain a correct elbow and wrist position. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. At destination: take your time</h3>\n\nIf you do decide to travel, be aware that most of the value added by your trip is going to be in socializing: getting closer to clients and partners, better understand their world and their point of view. For this reason, we recommend you take time to spend with the key people you are visiting. A good rule of thumb is to spend **at least three nights out**. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. At the end: document your trip</h3>\n\nMake sure that your colleagues and the community (including people you do not know, or who have not even joined Edgeryders yet) make the most of your trip by carefully documenting what you learned. In most cases, this is best done by writing a post in the appropriate category if this platform. Be mindful of the client's confidentiality needs: they might require that the documentation is not shared publicly.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Compensating emissions</h2>\n\nAll travel (but esp. air travel) results in direct greenhouse gas emissions. We strongly suggest to follow the following policy in any Edgeryders project to deal with this fact:\n\n> When we have to travel because remote collaboration is not possible, we allocate an adequate amount of the project budget to the compensation of the travel emissions.\n\nThe idea is to bake emission compensation right into the project budgets of all our project applications. That is hard to decline for any client, avoids any budgetary issues later, and may even \n\n**How to measure.** Before compensating, you should estimate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by your trip:\n\n* **For air travel.** A good tool that includes factors such as aircraft type, intermediate stops and route-specific aircraft occupancy is the [ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx).\n\n**How to choose a compensation measure.** Any credible measure that reduces or sequesters *current* emissions is fine. For example planting trees or capturing landfill methane. Measures that just reduce hypothetical future emissions \"that would happen due to economic growth\" are highly questionable though \u2013 the right thing to do is to *not* grow the economy at the cost of the climate in the first place, and incidentally that has a cost of zero.\n\n**How to compensate.** There are many ways to compensate emissions, and not all of them are equally trustworthy or cost efficient. We need to do more research in this area, but here are some initial pointers:\n\n* **[Treedom](https://www.treedom.net/en/)**, an Italian company providing a service of emission compensation by tree planting. The trees have IDs, you can choose their variety and location, and are informed about their status. Edgeryders started its forest there with [one Avocado Christmas tree](https://www.treedom.net/en/user/edgeryders-ou/trees/W4Z-8LY?filter=all), a gift received from @ilaria when [she proposed the compensation scheme](/t/11745).\n\n* **[LifeGate](https://www.lifegate.it/persone/iniziative/impatto-zero)**, another Italian company providing emission compensation via tree planting.\n\n* [**SouthPole**](https://market.southpole.com/) developes emissions reduction projects worldwide for both individuals and organisations, including forestry, renewables, waste management and energy access projects.\n\n* **[United Nations Carbon Offset Platform](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/).** A platform with many initiatives to choose from, certified by a UN certification scheme.", "created_at": "2019-08-15 12:50:42.672252", "updated_at": "2020-02-22 18:36:32.862017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6818, "wiki": true, "reads": 36, "score": 777.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [62302], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 4683, 5201, 4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8281, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1461, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What does freedom mean?</b>\n\nIt's intriguing that on one hand, you curate your profile and make sure there's information there about you, but on the other hand you are aware that there are dangers..

Let\u2019s put there everything by default. Let\u2019s make it more juicy and fun. And let\u2019s keep it trans-projects, within the ethics of maximizing mutual learning.\n[/quote]\n\nCertainly agree with investing in the bi-weekly -- this was my starting point in the original post. And yes, I would love for it to be juicy and fun. As step one to getting there, I mostly just need it to be more organised and informative, with more structured updates about each team's work on each project. Happy to make the ethnographic observations part of the bi-weekly meetings, and I think there would be more space to do this if the structure of the meeting was a bit more defined. I've talked to @marina about this and she has some small changes to suggest that will be helpful on this front, I think. \n\nThe community managers (@johncoate and @MariaEuler for NGI, and anyone on POPREBEL) are still welcome to join our coding bi-weeklys if they want to, since we will be having them anyway. If they do we'll set aside time every other meeting (once a month) to talk in more detail about the findings as they are relevant to community management. It's something we'd do anyway from an ethnographic perspective. \n\nOur bi-weekly coding meetings are also always open (the schedule and zoom link are on the ER schedule), so anyone interested can join at any time. This way, if anyone wants more detail on the ethnographic process they can come to those meetings, but I also commit to the larger team biweekly and giving updates on the ethnography on both projects in that space. \n\n[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:18, topic:14445\"]\nBut that is a different topic all together.\n[/quote]\n\nIt is, and it isn't. I actually think they're very related. \n\n[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:18, topic:14445\"]\nI think that is what makes the onboarding of new people to such an organisation so challenging. Of course, there always needs to be a balance. but yes, there are lots of structures and issues that might be clear to people who are around from the start that are hard to pick up upon without meeting and articulating. And to be able to know what type of initiatives one can take one needs to know that, or just shoot and maybe hit the wrong target.\n[/quote]\n\n\nThis is not the first time I have heard this from someone joining Edgeryders (by a long shot), so I would recommend heeding it -- it was also my experience, and I've done a lot of behind-the-scenes guidance/advising/pep talking with various people over the years. I also know I've personally done things suboptimally (driving @matthias crazy, for example) because I didn't have all the ropes figured out properly for a long time. Valuing the ability to jump in and improvise/innovate is great, but everyone needs some kind of guidance when entering a new space. And it seems as an organisation we love certain kinds of people who take initiative in certain kinds of ways but not others, sometimes. We aren't great at making things clear, and I think there is a real opportunity to kill multiple birds with one stone here, if we are willing to make small changes. \n\n@marina and I, for example, could start assembling a better platform organisation and tagging structure in each project section so it's easier to navigate each team's work. Small changes (clearer and more consistent tagging) would lead to a lot better clarity. \n\nWe could/should also assemble (or make it clear, if it's not already there) some introductory documentation and support for new members joining us. We're getting bigger, and some organisational clarity would really help people coming in. And we can use our own tools for this! I remember @MariaEuler and @hugi making a cool map of the different ER communities to try to understand everything going on in the platform. SSNA would work well for this :D \n\nSome of this is also interpersonal communication habits. I'd also encourage all of us to try to have a little bit more patience with our new members and give them more regular and structured feedback. The way we do things creates a pretty anxiety-ridden first few months (and more, for some people) that we could really alleviate with kinder person-to-person comms. \n\nI am making suggestions that I am fully ready to carry out myself (reliably being at the bi-weekly meeting, presenting the ethno team updates and needs in a clear and structured way, inviting community managers to the ethno meetings, creating new tags, and organising my own updates better on the platform). I am happy to do the work here so this doesn't require a big effort from anyone else (except probably @marina) in terms of labour, but it would require a recognition that things are suboptimal and a willingness to make small changes to practice. These are issues I've had the whole time I've been working at Edgeryders but have in the past decided to work around rather than address head-on (in large part due to the culture I address in part in this post), but I'm giving it a try now. I hope you can trust me when I say I'm nowhere near the only one who has experienced these things -- and I think small shifts could make a big difference.", "created_at": "2020-10-01 08:49:04.644843", "updated_at": "2020-10-01 08:58:04.604895", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 970, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 72.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [84035, 84039], "is_reply_to": [84035, 84039], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4022, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27568, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 726, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Talk to the Queen of Shitty Robots!</b>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3G9PuDZ_8c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQLFesz9O1g\n\nYeah she has a thing with electric shocks.\n\nI think she could help with outreach in many interesting niches.

So that said we need to \u00a0know what the energy source availability will look like and then adapt infrastructure accordingly. Right now the projects long term viability hinges on solar steam and biomass steam powered energy systems. \u00a0This will certainly work from a strict technical aspect, but will be very unlikely to provide the energy surplus to fuel the total infrastructure proposed.\n\nAll of that is not to say the project will not do a lot of good even if full goal is not reached, but there seems to be a need for a lower tech parallel development project with perhaps better odds of sucess.

Im Vorfeld meines Umzugs von London nach Berlin freute ich mich sehr darauf: Ich hatte eine interessante Arbeitsstelle an der Humboldt Universit\u00e4t gekriegt und eine Wohnung neben dem Mauerpark gefunden; Ich konnte schon nicht schlecht deutsch sprechen und hatte bereits ein paar guter Freunde in der Stadt. Das einzige, was mir Sorgen machte, war wie ich mit dem deutschen Gesundheitssystem zurechtkommen sollte. Im Jahre 2011 musste ich zweimal mit einem Nierenstein-Angriff zum Krankenhaus in London gehen. (Das war mein dritter Besuch insgesamt.) Das Krankenhaus war nur ein paar hundert Meter von meiner Wohnung entfernt und mein Partner konnte mich deshalb ganz schnell mit unserem Auto dorthin bringen. Ab dem zweiten Besuch konnten die \u00c4rzte meine Krankenakten angucken, mich sofort diagnostizieren und mir die n\u00f6tigen Schmerzmittel maximaler St\u00e4rke verabreichen. Aber in Berlin war das n\u00e4chste Krankenhaus zwei Kilometer von der neuen Wohnung entfernt. Ich wusste nicht, wie man einen Krankenwagen anruft, oder ob ein Nierenstein-Angriff sogar ernst genug w\u00e4re, um einen Krankenwagen zu rechtfertigen. Ich wusste nicht, ob Patienten in deutschen Rettungsstellen in derselben Reihenfolge wie in England behandelt werden. Ich wusste nicht, ob ich f\u00fcr die Behandlung w\u00fcrde bezahlen m\u00fcssen. Ich wusste nicht, ob ich den \u00c4rzten erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnte, was mit mir los ist \u2013 und sie \u00fcberzeugen, mir Schmerzmittel der gleichen St\u00e4rke wie in England zu verabreichen! Und ich konnte schon gut deutsch sprechen. Ich k\u00f6nnte mir nur vorstellen, wie erschreckend es sein muss, in einem Krankenhaus in einem fremden Land zu sein, ohne den \u00c4rzten seine Symptomen erkl\u00e4ren zu k\u00f6nnen \u2013 besonders wenn kein automatisches Recht auf Gesundheitsversorgung besteht. Schlussendlich hatte ich in Berlin keinen Nierenstein-Angriff und brauchte nicht deswegen ins Krankenhaus zu gehen. Aber damals hatte ich, als EU-B\u00fcrger, zumindest die gleichen Rechte auf Gesundheitsversorgung wie Deutsche. Wenn ich n\u00e4chstes Jahr, wie geplant, zur\u00fcck nach Berlin umziehe, wird Gro\u00dfbritannien wahrscheinlich aus der EU ausgetreten sein, und ich werde in Deutschland kein automatisches Recht auf Gesundheitsversorgung mehr haben. Das macht mir Sorgen.\n* Sollten Migranten/innen immer das Recht auf Gesundheitsversorgung im neuen Land haben?\n* Sollte die Regierung des Ursprungslands f\u00fcr die Gesundheit ihrer B\u00fcrger auch im Ausland verantwortlich sein?\n* Wenn Migranten/innen kein automatisches Recht auf Gesundheitsversorgung im neuen Land haben, welche andere Netzwerke k\u00f6nnen sie nutzen?", "created_at": "2019-05-13 16:03:38.816623", "updated_at": "2020-07-10 11:12:09.196632", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 445.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4934, 4773], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56034, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10243, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Great meeting you, @Leonie and @CorinneCathSpeth!

We import our green coffee directly from the farmers (most of them we know personally, some if them we so far only had contact with by email and telephone), mostly from Ecuador and Mexico and also some small amounts from Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\n\nOur main time consuming activity is .... cleaning coffee. Both before and after roasting. We deal with a lot of natural coffees and beans can have any color shade from light green to dark green cinnamon and  chocolate brown which is all fine. The ones we don't want are the ones that are grey or blueish grey, broken beans and beans with black spots. And I can tell you, especially in the Ecuadorian coffees there are a lot of those... From some of the coffees we actually take 10-15% of the beans out as being defects (in our view).  We recently started having them cleaned in Ecuador, but though it helps their standard of cleaning is not ours and we still have to manually clean and get rid off about 3-5% of the beans. \nNow there are a lot of defects one can spot in green coffee, but beans from unripe berries is difficult. In a washed coffee it's clearer as they have lighter colour, but in a natural coffee it's not so easy. So those we usually take out after roasting as the unripe ones don't really get much darker than light cinnamon colour and can thus be picked out easily.  Hence, we clean the coffee twice!\n\nAnd so to save ourselves the hours of work, not to mention the sore finger tips, we are looking for a small scale colour sorter for coffee. Unfortunately even the small laboratory models still have a price tag that is about our annual turn over and so they're unreachable for us at this moment.\n\nI run into this forum and of course it would be very interested in the final product. Also, I would love to somehow contribute. I cannot help you with the design and construction (I'm originally a civil engineer) but I do do a fair amount of programming - mostly Pascal and PHP, occasionally some Python, and my C/C++ and Fortran have become a bit rusty over the years. I could also contribute with photo's of beans in almost any colour we have them as well as photos of bean defects. I literally have kilos of defects here that I could take pictures of if you like....\n\nHope to hear from you,\n\nDennis \nEngrano (www.engrano.nl)\nThe Netherlands", "created_at": "2020-11-30 09:07:25.479174", "updated_at": "2020-11-30 09:07:25.479174", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 475, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 25.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79530, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12895, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Also these 3 got recommended by friends:\n\n1.  https://naturvernforbundet.no/?lang=en_GB (we have a direct contact with the Bergen chapter via a friend, if we decide).

Yes, lets build on this synergy. Yesterday - or was it the day before - time here in Matera lacks an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol\">NTP server</a>\u00a0- we discussed the Open Source Day that we are planning with @marc and @kei. The aim is to run this when @kei has sorted out her VISA issues. This looks best set after 12 June. So it looks like we are beginning to structure a series of events leading up to September, punctuated by regular training courses building on the work that @kei has done with the open tech school.\n\nLet's open up the discussion here on EdgeRyders about how this should work, and go with flow of what people here feel is the best strategy.\n\nFrom Viral Academy point of view it is simple - it is a publicly funded project and we want to get the best value for money in terms of teaching people who really need these skills, and / or to further develop a new methodology which can deliver this training to the people who need it.\n\nWe have budgeted for a small monthly stipend for core teachers of \u00a3500 a \"course\". This equates to about the same as a monthly stipend for unMonastery given a VA Course is about 6 weeks online teaching. So we can use this teaching budget to sponsor the stipends of unMonastarians for the planned extension of the project - as long as the sponsored projects provide the same value for money in terms of teaching technology.\n\nFrom the applicants and unMonastery point of view this is also a good thing. It's not like anyone is going to be asked to teach according to someone else's agenda. It is a very very open proposal. First Viral Academy \"courses\" are project based - so anyone doing a project that involves technology is fine. Second the applicant does not need to be a technology expert, as long as you want to pass on knowledge to local people that's great. Third the whole idea is to provide active online support to the \"teachers\" and projects - so both the unMonastery and the individual applicant should benefit from this technical support for their project.\n\nIn the next week we'll be posting a bunch of stuff abut the project, and hope to get as much feedback and guidance as we can from people here. So let's start the conversation.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-02 09:40:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.721150", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 430, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62865, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 11346, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Pinging a few others who may be interested: @Andrusha, @evangineer, @questioneer, @martial, @kazarnowicz,  @matteo_ghetti, @rasmus, @nadan and @phoebe", "created_at": "2019-11-03 20:06:32.197510", "updated_at": "2019-11-03 20:06:32.197510", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20533, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1474, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Hello Sarcha, \n\nI am very</b>\n\nHello Sarcha,\u00a0\n\nI am very proud and happy to see these nice initiatives happening recently in Athens, my lovely city...\u00a0\n\nI would like to recommend you to take a look at these reports you may find some nice inspiration:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/my-ride-local-food\" target=\"_blank\">Lucas G \"My ride with local food\"</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-mix-culture/mission_case/rete-g2-incredibly-true-adventure-group-foreigners-their-own-home-i-hate\" target=\"_blank\">Medhin \"Rete G2: the incredibly true adventure of a group of foreigners in their own home\"</a></li>\n\n</ul>See you in the conference xx\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-13 13:46:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.374808", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 136, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54350, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10030, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Hello @wlayche. I am a researcher, so my professional duties include looking at the ethical aspects of any research I participate in. In research, moral codes are more or less uncontroversial: everyone agrees you should refrain from exploiting others, make sure anyone participating in research does so with full consent and awareness, and so on. Much trickier, and more interesting, than moral codes is ethics, that @markomanka defines as \"how you translate your moral principles into action\". If my research uses other people as subjects and leads to a discovery, is it enough of a reward for them that my discovery could benefit the entire humanity? If I could patent my discovery, should I? If I do, should I share my proceedings with those people? And if I share them, what is a fair share for me to give them? 10%? 50%? 99%? You get the idea.\n\nAs you say, moral codes have not changed that much. We still understand human decency more or less in the same way. But *maybe* we have more agency, so more potential for action, so *maybe* more need to make choices that have an ethical dimension.

But when you are working in an open way it is very difficult to tell where the community should go or produce together. We see someone in Belgium going to Greece to offer mental health services - we try to support it without saying what should happen in order for the \"project\" to be an open system. We can say that opencare contributed to making it happen, and that for us is a success.\n\nThe good thing about having a Makers partner in opencare is that they can take a more\u00a0design approach to make the relationship between online conversations\u00a0and \"analogue\"as you say become structured.\u00a0\n\nTwo more thoughts from me as to the future of opencare and ability of the project itself to respond to local needs:\n\n1) Part of the solution may lie in our European consortium and how resources are distributed - we wanted to expand fellowships to more consistent support for projects, but are still waiting for approval from the European Commission.\n\n2) The other part, more important I believe because it is community driven and not public funding driven,\u00a0is: working for more possibilities in open ways, so that people who work with local problems can advance their work (labs like Woelab!). We don't imagine or design the open system, as per the Manzini model, we contribute to creating conditions.

Matteo Matteini is part of the OpenCare team at the City of Milan bringing his background in urban sociology to the project. In my original theme proposal I\u2019d set out a hope to explore the role of policy within the context of a networked and complex world. What if policy isn\u2019t an effective tool to deliver a course of action any more? Before their involvement in OpenCare this might have been a suggestion that would have been supported by experience in Milan. In early 2015, the City of Milan passed a law requiring all commercial and public premises bordering the road to provide access to people with limited mobility or disabilities. Fifteen months later, only 10% of businesses had complied with the new regulations. However, I was curious to learn during a call with Matteo that this was not as simple as demonstrating the limited efficacy of policy. He went on to describe the processes that OpenCare project partners had used to help turn round that low compliance rate. \n\nIt seems that by adopting a multi-stakeholder approach involving a range of partners from multiple perspectives along with facilitating processes that bring collective intelligence into play, that policies can be rendered effective tools that achieve the desired outcomes - in this case greater accessibility by those with mobility issues. For those who haven\u2019t yet caught Matteo\u2019s post on how we can implement policies through collaborative processes - you\u2019ll catch that *here*. Working with WeMake to co-design a process that would facilitate listening and cultivate relationships based on mutual understanding seems to have been key. \n<p/>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d626b706cf7fff51eae91b607e573077440f9b3.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\">\n\n<p> \nOpen Rampette\u2019s strong partnership approach will be evident at the Open Village session as Matteo will be joined by Lucia Scopelliti, Head of Economic Planning at Comune di Milano and Costantino Bongiorno of FabLab WeMake. They will share diverse perspectives on the project and its successes.\n\nOne of the criteria for the successes now being achieved through Open Rampette seems to be process design and deliberate steps to include all stakeholders; those holding different roles within the public administration, at various levels of seniority as well as shopkeepers and business owners and of course members of the public with mobility issues impacted by the lack of access to shops and other facilities. A particular challenge seems to have been engaging all the \u2018actors\u2019 within the public administration - something that was only achieved through persistent engagement to form the necessary relationships. Shopkeepers were another distinct stakeholder group - when the project team started talking to them they found that by and large they were willing to comply with the regulation and make their shops accessible, but they couldn\u2019t afford technical expertise to implement a solution. This was another role that WeMake were able to fill. They helped facilitate a process of co-design to include all the stakeholders in finding technical solutions, including a means by which those with mobility issues could contact the shopkeepers to alert them to their arrival. \n<p/>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/293ad21bd83fddceac171af45fbd4b2220b328a9.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n<p>\nMatteo also described the issues that can arise for lawmakers who devise regulations in isolation from those affected by the implications of implementation. In this case, the regulation created some complex protocols with which shopkeepers and businesses had to comply. This in itself was a barrier, quite apart from any other considerations such as cost, technical expertise and inconvenience. alessandro_contini agrees; \u201cIt\u2019s very common for bureaucratic procedures to be designed in a way that first off satisfies bureaucracy needs.\u201d Costantino and Alessandro have brought a social design to public policy as Costantino describes in his post as agile policymaking; \u201cSmall iterations, user research, interviews are few elements that guided our design process.

I have learned a lot during this short weekend. But let me first unpack the Transunions, because this is where some key things happened. \n\n![biennale-bannery-kwiecien-1400x733|690x361](upload://2NcjFkvfwrSSrSzh26peiIIRR0W.jpeg) \n\nFirst of all, my expectations were really high - Jonas Staal has become quite a stature in the art/politics world, organizing expansive, experimental formats for political debates, especially empowering for those who lack a voice and recognition. All that using as a backdrop the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw this time - a monument with its own incredible, complicated story. And yet it was so underwhelming - as if printing a colorful carpet and building colorful tables would give the much needed revolutionary edge to the meeting (if you go for constructivist esthetics, you probably count on it, right?). \n\nAs much as I love listening to smart people and learning new things about the world, I thought running this meeting in a form of a  panel, where 14 speakers were asked questions by two moderators, with the audience sitting on uncomfortable benches behind them, having to look at the screens if they wanted to see the person speaking, had as little transformative potential as it gets. \n\nI was happy to hear the journey of UNPO, an organization established in 1991 in Hague, that associates \"nations\" and groups that don't feel represented in their countries or internationally while considering the complexity of these entities, their stories, needs, and desires. Many of them do not wish for statehood or independence, rather self-determination that drives them towards peace. Many were caught in between power struggles, often because of their strategic location (borders, natural resources). The speaker, **Fernando Burges**, called the nation-state problem a Russian doll - you would always keep on having smaller and smaller groups demanding recognition, which is not feasible. Instead, their members want a seat at the table. An interesting example he gave was the presence of Washington DC in the organization as a state that doesn't have its own representation - while contributing one of the highest GDPs in the world. \n\n**Diouna Kcherie** elaborated on the grooming process at the UN and the power struggles behind it. She had been working for years in the communications in New York's UNICEF, UNHCR and others. She underlined the importance of the donor-receiver dynamics that create inequalities within the organization, as well as the young professionals' program that is addressed towards citizens of developing countries and financed by the donors (rich countries). She saw it problematic - years spent at the institutions, where these young talented people would be taught how and what to say in their professional capacity. She also criticized other mechanisms at play - for example, the fact that Greece wouldn't accept the help from UNHCR when dealing with the refugee crisis, because it didn't want to be perceived as a developing country. \n\n**Andrzej Nowak**, Polish philosopher, elaborated in a more scientific manner on the ills of the contemporary nation-state and what is being done to and with the underlying narratives. Poland, just like the US, loves its bombastic narratives, yet these are nowadays combined with other ideas, making the dismantling of the state as a protector (one that provides with stability, health, safety) possible. For example, the neo-liberal dream is manifested in anti-vaxxers movement or neo-tribalism. Adding to this the north/south division, we find ourselves in an increasingly difficult position to cooperate and build new kinds of unions. He called Poland a nationalist international, a cynical member of international institutions.\n\n**Abderrahim Kassou** from FMAS (Morrocan Forum of Alternatives) stressed the importance of looking for solutions in the south - and how the rest of the world will benefit from these. He cried at the \"almost-fatal impossibility\" to migrate to Europe from countries other than the three that are at war and are given a chance to escape. Considering these circumstances, he doesn't imagine nation-state surviving the challenges posed by the 21st century. \n\nWhat I found really intriguing in this part of the conference was Andrzej Nowak's suggestion that our role is now to do an ethnographic study of the nation-state and understand and hijack its roles, by determining what and how should they be provided and protected. His term for the times we live in was \"festival of entropy\". John Jordan, an artist and activist, asked what we want to do with the power - to constitute, or destitute it? For him, the ideals that Zapatistas stood for - breaking up power and handing it out to autonomous organisation - was something worth bringing back to life. In times when corporations slowly take over many of the state's traditional roles, while being relatively unregulated, we have an opportunity to build some of the roles bottom-up. \n\nAnd then the first signs of what was about to happen: **Diana Arce** from the Berlin Black Lives Matter, started with raising the issue of violence that the nation-state is funded on, quoting a case of a British citizen, who happens to be black, who was stripped of her nationality because she joined ISIS - she is trying to escape, but she won't be allowed back to her country. She was surprised by the lack of minority votes in the discussion, but also very western examples given - such as the artwork shown at the Biennale, where Spanish artist Nuria Guell shows the steps she took to denounce her Spanish nationality, which turned out to be impossible. The position of privilege here was definitely under-stressed. \n\n**Siana Bangura**, black artist and activist from the UK, seconded that by saying removing yourself from a problem is not a solution, merely an escape - we should all face the underlying currents of violence on which the nation state was founded. \n\nNo questions asked by the public (no time for that), we move on to the second panel, where we start hearing other inspiring stories: **John Jordan**, who was part of a movement that squatted an area on which the French state planned to build an airport, talks about his role in the resistance and the movement that succesfully developed there over years. ZAD, located in Brittany, became a sustainable community seen by the state as a threat \"worse than Mosul in Iraq\" (quote from the president of the region). The government attempted multiple times to destroy it, until it finally succeeded in 2019. For him disobedience and direct action are the ways forward, as the state does not hand out help. Key challenges? When you try to convince others, you create monocultures. The idea is to learn to work and live together in diversity. \n\nWhen Diana Arce and Angelo Camufingo from Germany started talking about the history of black people in Germany, with over 500 years of their presence in the country, and disappearing traces of first PhDs awarded to black citizens (the records are there, but the thesis isn't - all the others survived, though), and the support the German state gave to slave trade in history, one of the German members of the public comes up to the microphone and takes over. He tells us his story of being a Sri Lankan born to a resistance fighter in Germany in the 80-ties, and denied to this day citizenship, because his parents are not German. He had to leave the country at some point due to this status and became a refugee in his parents' country for a decade, then moved to India. He is now back in Germany, where he is raising a child with his partner, and experiences the incredible hypocrisy and injustice of the way states in Europe have been set up, addressing personally some of the panelists and accusing them of propagating the modernist, sick nation state, speaking from the position of power and privilege (those who came from outside of the \"North\" weren't spared). \n\nAnd this is when the battle started. Moderators were trying to steer the conversation back on the track and give voice to the next guest speaker - while Diana stood up and asked them to shut the fuck up and swallow their discomfort. She decided to give her space to someone who wants to share their experience, and this is what she demands now. Intervention from the minority voices continues, while the panelists stubbornly attempt at bringing back the \"harmony\". Eventually, they succeed and  **Zdenka Badovinac** gave her speech about her work in a contemporary art museum in Ljubljana and relations between wealthy art collectors and Eastern European countries. It couldn't feel more out of touch than it did at this point. \n\nFinally, Jonas Staal stood up and apologized for what happened at the panel - the way it was designed and led wasn't benefiting the purpose of the debate. So the third part would happen in a setting stripped of tables. The microphones stayed where they were, but because those who represented female-and-minority-led (Kurdish Women's Movement, Black Lives Matter) organizations decided to seat with the public in the outer circle, the format changed. The last part turned into an exchange of experiences, strategies and ways to mobilize that  these alternative movements design and devise. It finally didn't have the refined flavour of a professional and academic debate, but a frank conversation where people could discuss strategies that worked (Black Lives Matter in the UK successfully made it impossible for the British government to keep on selling arms to countries like Saudi Arabia, thanks to a lawsuit they won after trying 4 times!), **Dilar Dirk** gave a powerful explanation on the principles behind the female-led movement in Kurdistan: the need to decolonize ourselves from patriarchy, the way new structures of confederation have to be led by women, internationalization will be based on common struggle, which goes beyond efficiency, and beyond the circle of violence. An Egyptian artist, now in residence in Zamek Ujazdowski, talked about the need to develop new concepts of time, others criticised the NGOisation of resistance and the theft by these organizations of revolutionary ideas. \n\nThere were more interesting stories to quote, but my key takeaway from this event was: if we want to work on world-shaping and revolutionary ideas, these old school formats with their old school ways of leading the discussion, and their exclusive content, have to be replaced by something that is driven by minorities and women, and communities. It needs to be more organic, community-based, and then somehow internationalized - as there is an obvious need of developing collaborations between the countries in the global south, the poorer countries in the \"North\", and various disadvantaged groups and communities all around the globe. This was not a setting where a strong platform and collaboration could be conceived - it rather showed how white, privileged men struggle breaking through some of the power structures in order to turn them into vehicles of radical change. Only when women, most of them of color, took over the floor, the debate seemed to be gaining the right energy - but then it was late, people were hurt and too much energy was already wasted. \n\nI will update this post with a video of this conference when it shows online, as it was promised. I really recommend having a look at it, maybe some of you will see it differently.

Most of us now realise the disconnect between what they were promised they would get if they worked hard - a career they could move up the ladder on, a home they could call their own and sufficient income to provide for themselves and others - and the reality that makes any of these expectations impossible for most people. But these expectations we were taught are also social norms. If people no longer believe in social norms in a major area of their life, then it can lead to a spillover effect that they no longer believe in social norms in other areas - don't know if this relates to the darker aspects of life that Matthias and Freelab discuss ?\u00a0\n\nAs someone pointed out during the riots, \u201cwhat\u2019s protecting the clothes in Primark isn\u2019t the glass in the window but the social contract that prevents us breaking it\u201d.

The only antecedent you mention is a Republican pro-climate candidate gaining the primaries; this, one imagines, is not something that just randomly happened, but the outcome of American business re-assessing their strategic position, and deciding to swing their support to such a candidate. In turn, their new strategies are probably based not just on altruistic considerations (if those were important, they would be weighing in already), but on some kind of realignment of _economic_ incentives.

It's tiring indeed and many people take the easy way out when they can - sure, lets do the traditional wedding, otherwise we will never hear the end of it. It's a quick fix solution that usually leads to more damage eventually - no one is happy and any other alternative options later become more and more difficult to explain and justify.\n\nThe Czech story reveals a big truth - in the existing complexities it is more difficult to navigate relationships with other people as well, especially when they are multi-ethnical, multicultural, of different spiritual beliefs. It's a huge burden as well. And I feel it should be burden for the traditional carriers of spirituality - the Church had bright spots in history in delivering exactly the experiences people needed to experience togetherness and gather strength for fighting injustice. In Montgomery bus boycott and M.L.King's journey the church played a central role. In Serbia - the churches and monasteries were crucial places for everyone who was fighting back the Ottomans, and held that role for over 400 years.\nBut the challenge today really is how to make dominant churches back out of the secular arena in a healthy way, how to leave room for all the cultures , but also find ways to create those spaces of togetherness for those who need them and would want them from the church.", "created_at": "2019-06-06 08:10:07.125045", "updated_at": "2019-06-06 08:10:07.125045", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 261, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54250], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34301, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 6660, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@shajara Thanks for the post.

As warrants circulate, the app logic states how to resolve them. Banning? Flagging? Starting a process? All that is also meant to be dependable on the reputations and prior histories of the actors issuing warrents as well as those on the receiving end.\n\nAlso, theoretical and only partially implemented at this stage (again AFAIK).\n\nI don't know how all that jives with what is cooking in the SSB cauldrons but my purpose in life is cross-pollination so I hope it might help in these early days of evolution :honeybee:", "created_at": "2019-05-22 21:41:52.080188", "updated_at": "2019-05-22 21:45:12.803545", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 457, "wiki": false, "reads": 40, "score": 198.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53772], "is_reply_to": [53772], "is_liked_by": [4022, 8, 4, 5040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38222, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 7421, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone, a note on what we're spending for our event, from Edgeryders side. \nI was happy to confirm this morning as I was re-checking the numbers that pretty much the entire budget is _directly_ contributing to people's ability to come, share, enjoy each other's presence.\n\nNB: The numbers below don't include the countless hours of work for strategizing, sales, community building and engagement by the edgeryders directors and some close collaborators.

It will operate only in Timisoara, or you intend to expand its activity also in Bucharest?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-29 19:38:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.847226", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 114, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50797, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9091, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Insects dying off\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/insects-dying-off-sign-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-2?fbclid=IwAR1SbsisrM9lrIAgovpkKwfUBKgOQDx285HUahwGD81l85fMCZxQINvBfpw", "created_at": "2019-02-12 02:39:17.482487", "updated_at": "2019-03-01 04:27:36.291830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40792, "user_id": 4259, "topic_id": 7918, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everybody its \u00e0 very interresting Day with you with \u00e0 lot of positive energie and \u00e0 lot of news informations that i take it today i want to say to the mens they help me \u00e0 lot and take care of me Thank you Thank you Thank you and this is the way we builld \u00e0 better country for a better tomorrow i swear brother and Sister that mean \u00e0 lot for me", "created_at": "2017-12-28 18:22:04.191328", "updated_at": "2017-12-28 18:22:04.191328", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 74, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 269.8, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3942, 4085, 4088, 4266, 4263, 3904, 1935, 5, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2772, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 2739, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Last Friday I rushed to write an application for <a href=\"http://bfi.org/challenge\">2014 Buckminster Fuller Challenge</a> since it had deadline in the evening of that day.

We believe in peace and prosperity through trade and value the diversity of perspectives that comes with a large community located in over 80 countries. The Edgeryders organisation itself strives to be politically neutral beyond a common respect for human rights and democracy. \n* Our contribution is to build large scale dialogue between citizens and other stakeholders in society, in order to make sense of the big challenges that face us all. \n* We have built friendly, respectful environment and innovative tools for people to discuss things and find ways different actors in the system can align efforts to tackle them. At local, national and transnational level.\n\n* How is this financed? Mostly through research grants from the European Union as well as contracts for social innovation work from organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme.\n\n* \"But I don't like the European Union, it's useless\".

But the question remains open...\n\nThere is a kind of self-organized network of schools, <a href=\"http://www.scuolesenzapermesso.org/\">\u201cScuole senza Permesso\u201d</a> (\u201cSchools without documents\u201d), but it represents only a particular kind of schools.\n\nAnd yes, a lot of teachers testify that it\u2019s really useful for their job to be in contact with other schools, teachers and approaches, but it\u2019s not so easy to register the results of an improvement in the quality of teaching. This is because you need to have data about the situation before and after, in order to register the gap and there are a lot of other factors that can influence your way of teaching.\n\nFor all these reasons what I could say it\u2019s that there are refugees and asylum seekers happy to have had an Italian class also in August (because of Italianostranieri Community), but it\u2019s not so simple to measure the improvement\u00a0in the\u00a0quality of teaching and I think also that it\u2019s a long-term effect\u2026but for sure it could be great to work on it\u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-24 14:53:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.586605", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 305, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5029, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4996, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I am building a landing page for would be LOTE5 participants to give a quick and easy way to understand what is going on, why it makes sense to get involved and a simple form to submit your story to secure a ticket, or schedule an interview with someone (and then get help turning it into a story to secure a ticket).
