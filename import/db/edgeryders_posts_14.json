In the space of just a few decades, it has grown into a fantastically complex system, ever evolving, taking on new functions, opening new markets, facilitating and accelerating all kinds of social dynamics \u2013 from fantasy virtual worlds to swarms of bots to game our elections and sinister surveillance systems. Like everyone else, we watched it unfold, and wondered what was next.\n\nIn 2016, the European Commission did the right thing and launched a [Next Generation Internet initiative](https://ngi.eu) (NGI). The idea was, and remains,  making sense of what the Internet is evolving into, and embed human rights and the rule of law deep into its core. Last year, we joined this initiative as part of NGI Forward, a research project that the Commission means to be the \u201cstrategic brain\u201d of the NGI initiative. For a year, we hosted a conversation on how the Internet is evolving. We have seen, and analyzed, a rich discussion on how Internet technology, ethics, and climate change are intertwined. Topics like AI, blockchains, big data, fintech have been top of mind.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit.\n\nWe live in Europe, the region hit hardest by the pandemic. As we write, the continent is shifting gears. The whole of society is coordinating to protect its weakest: overworked nurses doctors treat the sick; stressed delivery workers try to keep people stocked; everyone else is protecting essential infrastructure, or staying out of the way.\n\nCOVID-19 made the Internet even more relevant than before. Quarantined, confined, socially distanced, Europeans use it for their work, their schooling, their shopping, staying in touch with loved ones. Even more than before, the need for an NGI initiative is clear, and we are prouder than ever to be part of it.\n\nBut the conversation about the Internet has shifted. Suddenly, opening new markets is no longer top of mind. \u201cInnovation\u201d is no longer a cool activity to pitch investors with, but a grim necessity. \u201cMoving fast and breaking things\u201d no longer seems like such a great idea. The appropriateness of paywalling and DRM-ing potentially life saving content (scientific articles, for example) looks dubious.\n\nThere are new priorities. Staying connected, as human beings. Reaching out. Helping others to cope. Making key information (open access!) and data (open data!) accessible. Honing ways that we can work together without physical presence \u2013 our own open source [Distributed Collaboration Manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263?u=alberto), launched in late 2019, turned out to be very timely. The generosity, the drive to help, the human need to reassure and be reassured, are everywhere. It\u2019s just like Solnit described in [A Paradise Built in Hell](https://books.google.be/books?id=Ikky4CKuS_oC&redir_esc=y), but in the digital sphere: catastrophes dissolve egoisms, and conjure amazing communities as stricken populations work together to respond. We ourselves are part of this, from @RobVanKranenburg\u2019s attempt to [build a stack for a privacy-aware disposable identity to handle COVID-19 status data](https://github.com/disposableidentities/healthcrisis/blob/master/README.md), to Edgeryders\u2019 effort to get organizations to work through remote collaboration.\n\nWe have seen this before. The early days of the Internet were community-centric. As we watch the flood of pain, shock, warmth and laughter online, we are reminded of the words of Howard Rheingold:\n\n> My direct observations of online behaviour around the world over the past ten years have led me to conclude that whenever computer-mediated communications technology becomes available to people anywhere, they inevitably build virtual communities with it, just as microorganisms inevitably create colonies.\n\nHoward wrote these words in 1999.\n\nAt the same time, he \u2013 like other digital activists \u2013 also warned about impending dystopian risks. And they are here, too, stronger than ever. The potential for surveillance of smartphones and other connected devices is seen in a new light, as demands for special powers to governments to curtail civil liberties in the COVID-19 emergency come to the fore. Companies with dubious track records like Palantir and Clearview AI are [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-track-virus-governments-weigh-surveillance-tools-that-push-privacy-limits-11584479841) talking to governments to implement pervasive surveillance tools.\n\nThe Next Generation Internet initiative suddenly finds itself in a new, more central position. It no longer is about re-orienting funding streams for technical innovation, and creating beautiful gadgets and clever services. Now it\u2019s about community resilience, personal freedom and happiness. It\u2019s about having an infrastructure that enables us to take care of each other, get the supplies to the people that need them, keep the lights on against this dark night, and the ones that almost certainly will come in the future. It\u2019s about protecting each other from those who dream themselves our masters. It\u2019s about who we love, and how best we build for each other, and for ourselves.\n\nWe cannot screw this up. We need to build a human, hospitable world that we can all inhabit, on the other side of the pandemic. Thanks to its unique position, the NGI Forward project has a voice. We are offering it to you, and making you a promise. This:\n\n1. We are going to host a deep, frank, fearless conversation about the Internet in the times we live in. We welcome everyone\u2019s contribution, because everyone is an expert on this, because everyone is going through the ordeal of COVID-19, and everyone is online part of the time, or knows someone who is.\n2. We are going to pay attention to every single contribution, and aggregate them all into a meaningful picture, where we can look for patterns together. We will publish all data as open. Nothing you contribute to this conversation will get lost in the noise of social media. We are not so much trying to make a list of initiatives, though that's welcome too, but to reflect together on *why* we (collective \"we\") feel the need to roll out those initiatives, what values they embed, what they have to say about us as participants, and as members of the human community.\n3. We are going to deliver this picture, as a product of our collective intelligence, to the European Union institutions.\n\nAre you in?", "created_at": "2020-03-18 17:01:18.774630", "updated_at": "2020-12-17 16:03:02.435919", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1049, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 73.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70891, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 154, "raw": "ping @MariaEuler @hugi guys what do you think?", "created_at": "2020-03-04 13:06:32.593632", "updated_at": "2020-03-04 13:06:32.593632", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 18.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [70890], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62004, "user_id": 5483, "topic_id": 11227, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks for such a quick write up @MariaEuler.

He found out that his kids spend a lot of time in school -from 6:30 to 16 :30 going from Elmaady to Eltagamo' everyday and they come back exhausted with no energy or time to even study , do their homework and play and they became accustomed to have the easy answer for the questions and not to search for the answers themselves because obviously they have not time or energy to do so, this besides the fact that every day in school he is a sitting passively listening to teachers and the curriculum itself has lots of problems.\n\nSo Hany \u2013with 2 kids ahmed in the 1st preparatory stage and karim in the 3rd primary stage\u2013 took a daring decision to quit school for his kids and start homeschooling.Of course the kids were over the moon with this decision and now it has been less than a year for them homeschooling and learning through the calvert school curriculum and this program you can take a test online and get a certificate so if the student wants to go back to other institutional education so it is a big risk for them but it is somehow a good calculated risk .\n\nNow Hany's kids are homeschooling with the help of \"Atef Rostom\" \u2013Hany's friend who is responsible for guiding and helping the kids and his daughter karima in their studies\u2013 and this gave them more time to play sports and interact with the \"real world\" more ,even Ahmed \u2013Hany's older son\u2013 is interested in mobile and computer apps and tries to see lectures and read about it and Hany is helping him by getting him access to a programming company where he tested some of their apps as a user and saw how the process of programming is done. The Kids faced some problems at first about the change in the way of learning and mainly because of the english language level but they are improving in a good pace.\n\nThe idea of homeschooling in Egypt \u2013in the words of Hany\u2013 is scary for some people like the idea of revolution and for others they don't have time to think for a solution for this problem because of the daily tiring work they do in order to make a living. but on the other hand there people interested in the idea and always asks how to do it.\n\nThis was a another scene in the homeschooling community in Egypt which is growing and have different directions and systems.", "created_at": "2017-08-07 22:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-10 15:41:03.563236", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 770, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 8934.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68115, "user_id": 3811, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 32, "raw": "I'm moving on to become full time formative.\nAnd of course about food, cheese specifically (techniques, technologies, history, anthropology, ecology...).\n\nSo far, I already started being part time formative for the official cheesemonger CAP (professional graduation in France) but I also am in touch with design schools and anthropocene study programs for a more historical and anthropologocal approach of the cheese and milk cycle.\n\n(and for those who I crossed path with in Essaouira, couple of years ago, this is definitely the continuation of my small journey there)", "created_at": "2020-01-03 10:30:51.510847", "updated_at": "2020-01-03 10:30:51.510847", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 89, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68086], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60215, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10940, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@J_Noga\n![70333851_524072998354385_8177022870023569408_n|690x690](upload://wRmgpHIs0le3OgVkyEvFI6bPinO.jpeg) \n**Digital Policy Adviser** ,  **Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS)**\nJustin joined FEPS in summer 2018 to lead the digital policy portfolio.

I've seen you in action while speaking to Luca de Biase in Matera: the content made a lot of it, but there is something about the interaction which is fundamental, and you do it greatly... but as you say: not alone. And I guess this brings me back to the question you asked a couple of times on this platform on burnouts and keeping things going, ecc: I think being totally alone in doing stuff is, on the long run, a promise for burnout.\u00a0\n\nEnough with the digressions. Back to point 1 and 2. How I understand this it's about mapping, then selecting a small kernel and start making contact. I'm really up for sharing the mapping work and eventually fitting in personal network, if needed. My mind is probably biased by ethnography, but could the point 1 be something like: mapping / seeing what challenges are uncovered-overepresented - selecting a small kernel / doing some interviews and coming back to think on the content? Or\u00a0is this too long of a process?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCould the LOTE be a good opportunity to start conveying attention and illustrate the process while in action?

The authors of the report claimed that it is not possible to understand (on the base of statistical macro-data retrieved from international organisations\u2019 urban dataset) what these factors are  Therefore, they claim to be  unable to  explain apparent oddities or even contradictions in the results. I think the effort is valuable but the difficulty derives from the adopted perspective. \n\nOn the contrary  I want to know what a supporting innovation ecosystem is from the perspective of innovators, as I believe that the phenomenon can be only understood if one investigate (digital) social innovation in the making from the perspective of its makers. Etnographic analysis could work well to this end, and  also SSNA.\n\nTo explore the innovator\u2019s ecosystems in Europe I think the semantic social network analysis can be used as the key methodology for the project, with some complementary bibliometrics and web mapping for the background research and some in-deep interviews to key-informants and on-the-field opinion collection. \n\nSSNA can be used for the analysis of online conversation of digital social innovators communities, with the intent of mapping links and patterns that allow some communities to grow up; and of connecting them with specific locations where experiences are performed (as social innovations is always a way to deal with specific issues felt by somebody, somewhere). \n\nThe social innovators community - apart from Edgeryders itself- can be partnered in the project and asked permission to work on their conversation. \n\nOn this point I would need your help. The MSCA project proposal does not need to be detailed in technical terms but some specification about the data collection and analysis would help. Do you think it feasible?\n\nThe main focus of MC action is training by researching and the mutual profitability of the matching should be demonstrated. \n\nIn working with you, I could get to know how to use SSNA (i.e. gaining technical competence) and experience research in private institutions; in working with me you can have somebody else testing your key methodology in a different research field, and embedding my competence in urban studies and critical social studies. \n\nJust a quick note on terms. I know you might not like the definition \u201cdigital social innovation\u201d. I have no particular reason for using it instead of any other with the same meaning\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!\nChiara", "created_at": "2019-06-07 15:18:06.912610", "updated_at": "2019-06-07 15:18:06.912610", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 630, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 58.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 5263], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29491, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3190, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Update.</b>\n\nUpdate on current stage of development:\u00a0\n\nWe've produced the initial list of cards - it's way to long right now but over the next day or so we're going through a period of reduction and consolidation using a printed copy.

Also the analogies with computer networks don't really apply as machines are not inconvenienced by frequent demands for synchrony, and do not value the freedom of messaging when they want (which might be 3 am like I do now).\n\nBut I agree that typical asynchronous office communication is broken. Not because of e-mail as a tool but because people try to *talk* over that tool. Which is a bad hack that's done just because it's the most immediate paradigm most people have for \"communication\" and so it is \"convenient\" for them, and the technology is cheap and fast enough to allow it.\n\nInstead, I think two other paradigms would be better for asynchronous communication:\n\n1. **Pull-based documentation.** That's my favourite, quite obviously. Good documentation is not like talking, but its inversion. It does not look like a protocol of a conversation, but rather like a book / manual where all pieces of many conversations before have been taken and sorted in to the \"right\" place. All information being available like that unlocks a lot of the otherwise slow progress in asynchronous communication.\n\n2. **Mail.** If people used it like \"snail mail\" messages before, it would work much better. In mail, people would have to think 2-3 steps ahead in the communication and lay out their replies to these possible answers. It's about substantial exchange of thought, at considerable length per message. So one exchange back and forth is worth at least 2-3 steps in a synchronous interaction.\n\nI agree with the article that carefully chosen meetings are valuable for progress in collaboration \u2013 every tool for its purpose! In the Edgeryders company, we rely on asynchronous communication for nearly everything but we also know when it's more appropriate to \"call a meeting\" of the directors. It only happens every few weeks, fortunately.\n\nMy favourite example for a collaboration technology that offers the best from both worlds is NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (\"JPL\") where they developed something called \"Xtreme Collaboration\" in the 90s: there would be some weeks of asynchronous collaboration to identify and work out what blocks progress, and then one 4-6 hours meeting of 30-40 engineers where they planned and decided a complete space mission, including all the tech details that needed a common decision. They did so in a \"warroom environment\" that included both special collaboration software and all these people.\n\nComparing this brilliant example and the contemporary e-mail and messaging maze, it seems obvious that the Net does not have the right collaboration tool yet, at least not in widespread use. And beyond the conventions that I proposed above, I don't have much of an idea how it could look like \u2026 including how to mould these conventions into a tool that \"soft-enforces\" them, which is needed because conventions are hard to impossible to enforce by telling coworkers what to do.\n\nSo, inspirations welcome.

The new fellowship opportunity. @MariaEuler it would be great if you could work together with @inge prepare this.\n\n4.

And how different people can use it. Read: sensestack pitch. Help @hugi\n\n5.

All you need is an alias and email address, If your prefer to be anonymous- that's perfectly fine. \n   * Tell us about interesting work people are doing at intersections of tech and climate action/ transition to zero carbon cities\n   *  Sign up now to be informed when we roll out the Edgeryders Climate-Kic joint initiatives.\n\n7.

By \"completely different\" I mean *completely* different: not just another mix of market-capitalism-with-state-corrections, but something with different goals and different ways. By \"economic systems\" I mean something that could be debugged with intellectual rigor, and hopefully come to be intellectually consistent and achievable, at least in principle. \n\nWe think that this work is urgent. The foundations of the present economic system are stuck in the 1850s. Economists won't do it, because they are too invested in academic orthodoxy (with exceptions). \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:8534\"]\nThere is an important idea that is not receiving enough attention: the economic foundations of a modern society (let\u2019s say late 21st century). [...] This was not always the case: in the 19th century we had attempts at sweeping paradigm design (Marx, Proudhon, anarchic collectivism and mutualism), as well as prototypes (Fourier\u2019s Phalanst\u00e8res, Owen\u2019s New Lanark, and, later, Adriano Olivetti\u2019s Ivrea factory as the economic engine of the Community Movement).\n\nWe seem to have lost this alliance between top-notch economists like Marx and bold entrepreneurs like Owen in imagining possible alternative organizing principles for the economy. And that\u2019s a shame: even if we do not want to change our economic system, there\u2019s something wrong in not even being able to imagine anything else. It makes society more fragile.\n[/quote]\n\n\nBut someone *is* willing to do it: (some) science fiction authors.\n\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:8534\"]\n\n\nThe one exception I am seeing is a small cadre of science fiction authors (it later turned out to be [not so small](/t/8582). Exhibit A is Cory Doctorow, who is definitely economics-literate (see [here ](http://www.cottica.net/2010/08/30/leconomia-di-makers-di-cory-doctorowthe-economics-of-cory-doctorows-makers/)). His recent *Walkaway* (see [here ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7633)) comes closest to painting a picture of a completely different economic system. There are a few others: Bruce Sterling; Neal Stephenson; and, partially, William Gibson and Peter Watts.\n[/quote]\n\nSo, here's the news: **with the support of [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/), we are organizing a \u201cblue sky\u201d seminar bringing together some of these authors; some professional economists willing to play ball; and some entrepreneurs who are experimenting with enterprise-scale economic models**.

We are negotiating with *really* exciting speakers, so stay tuned.\n* One or more economics seminars for about 5-10 people each, with the goal of sketching out future papers that would support or critique fully alternative economic systems.\n* A workshop on turning yourself into an utopian activist, hopefully in collaboration with our friends at [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/).\n* A party. Because, well, what kind of utopia would it be if we could not dance?\n\nAll this is of course way too rushed, but what the hell.

This new media of videoconferencing has been around for 20 years, maybe more, but it feels like the early \u201980s of the internet, when we had bulletin boards. Where people were logging on. The tech then was terrible, crude, and user-unfriendly, but you had a sense of its power and potential.\n\nAll the great things that we\u2019ve done as a species so far have been done shoulder to shoulder, living within walking distance of each other. These new telecommunication tools allow us to do things together, but not necessarily in real time. Look at Wikipedia: It\u2019s a tremendous achievement of mankind but achieved asynchronously. It\u2019s bit by bit, here and there. These new tools are going to allow us to collaborate at vast scale in real time. \nWhen you give people total freedom for their schedule, you find it\u2019s not a binary thing of either they work at home or they work in the office. Generally, you find people spend two or three days together and then two or three days alone. And those two, three days together are very important.\n\nThey allow for serendipitous, chance meetings.

Below there's an example I just stumbled over, which to me seems to be reasonably representative for what the current state of affairs is. \n\nHowever, before diving in, here's a thing I'd be really interested in: **If you know first hand (or really, really credibly second hand) of the way that decisions around smart cities have been made or are being made in municipalities around the world, could you share the examples? Feel free to leave out any names that might implicate anyone or cause them trouble; this is just meant to collect more examples.**\n\nSo here goes: [A few months old](https://www.waz.de/staedte/duisburg/chinesischer-it-riese-huawei-ist-fuer-duisburg-ein-risiko-id221223665.html) (and in German), but two points of view that I'll just offer side by side as they pretty much sum up the state of play in smart cities these days.\n\nFor context, this is about a smart city partnership in which Huawei implement their technologies in Duisburg, a mid-sized German city with a population of about 0.5 million. The (apparently non-binding) partnership agreement includes Smart Government (administration), Smart Port Logistics, Smart Education (education &amp; schools), Smart Infrastructure, 5G and broadband, Smart Home, and the urban internet of things.\n\nNote: The quotes and paraphrases are roughly translated from the original German article.\n\nJan Weidenfeld from the Marcator Institute for China Studies:\n\n> \"As a city administration, I'd be extremely cautious here.\" China has a fundamentally different societal system, and a legal framework that means that every Chinese company, including Huawei, is required to open data streams to the communist party. (...)\n>\n>\n>\n> Weidenfeld points out that 5 years ago, when deliberations about the project began, China was a different country than it is today. At both federal and state levels, the thinking about China has evolved. (...)\n>\n>\n>\n> \"Huawei Smart City is a large-scale societal surveillance system, out of which Duisburg buys the parts that are legally fitting - but this context mustn't be left out when assessing the risks.\"\n\nAnja Kopka, media spokesperson for the city of Duisburg:\n\n> The city of Duisburg doesn't see \"conclusive evidence\" regarding these security concerns.The data center meets all security requirements for Germany, and is certified as such. \"Also, as a municipal administration we don't have the capacity to reliably assess claims of this nature.\" Should federal authorities whose competencies include assessing such issues provide clear action guidelines for dealing with Chinese partners in IT, then Duisburg will adapt accordingly.\n\nThe translation is a bit rough around the edges, but I think you'll get the idea:\n\nWe have experts warning, but the warnings are of such a structural nature that they're kinda of to big and obvious to prove.  *Predators will kill other animals to eat.*  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nBy the time abuse or any real issue can be proven, it'd be inherently to late to do anything about it. We have a small-ish city administration that knows perfectly well that they don't have the capacity to do their due diligence, so they just take their partners' word for it.\n\nThe third party here, of course, being a global enterprise with an operating base in a country that has a unique political and legal system that in many ways isn't compatible with any notion of human rights, let alone data rights, that otherwise would be required in the European Union.\n\nAnd it's along these two axes \u2014 imbalance of size and incompatibility of culture \u2014 that I think we see the most interesting, and most potentially devastating conflicts:\n\n* A giant corporation runs circles around a small-to-mid sized city. I think it's fair to assume that only because of Chinese business etiquette was the CFO of one of Huawei's business units even [flown out to Duisburg to sign](https://cities-today.com/duisburg-signs-smart-city-partnership-with-huawei/) the initial memorandum of understanding with Duisburg's mayor S\u00f6ren Link. The size and power differential is so ridiculous that it might just as well have been the  *Head of Sales EMEA*  or some other mid-level manager that took that meeting. After all, for Chinese standards, a city of a population of a half-million wouldn't even considered a [third tier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system) city. Talk about an uneven playing field.\n* The vast differences of (for lack of a better word, and broadly interpreted)  *culture*  in the sense of business realities and legal framework and strategic thinking between a large corporation with global ambitions and backed by a highly centralized authoritarian state on one side, and the day-to-day of a German town are overwhelming.

The minisite will be a single-page application made with a JavaScript framework of @hugi's choice, and hosted as a compact, static website on the Edgeryders server.\n\n    Deployment can be done via git, as done on surge.sh. It is done [like that on the NGI Forward platform](https://github.com/edgeryders/ngi-forward-platform#3-usage) as well, just that we pull automatically from the Github master branch.\n\n2. The inisite collects input from the user and talks directly to Discourse by API.\n\n3. The Discourse API includes some custom API endpoints where necessary, in the same way how [we already extended the Discourse API](/t/7904). The same Discourse API key is used to access both the standard Discourse API and our extensions. Extending the API is done with Ruby, directly as part of the Discourse codebase.\n\n4. Our extensions to the Discourse API are packaged and distributed as a [Ruby gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems). If possible it would rather be a Discourse plugin, but I think extending the API is beyond what plugins are allowed to do in Discourse.\n\n5. The extended Discourse API can also include endpoints with cached responses, if there is a need for that.\n\nThat kind architecture means doing it the same way how Discourse itself is made, providing a second frontend for the same Discourse API backend. In that way, that's quite elegant.\n\nAdvantages of adding custom API endpoints as extensions to the Discourse API itself:\n\n* We avoid duplicating parts of the already existing official Discourse API, but instead use that wherever possible.\n\n* We avoid one or two layers of APIs. Every additional layer of API is complexity, and complexity must be avoided at all costs unless it's better to have it :slightly_smiling_face:  \n\n* We build on the work of an extended Discourse API that we already started, rather than starting another one from scratch.\n\n* The Ruby code implementing the API runs in the Discourse environment, so it can access all Discourse classes and also the database. For future scenarios, database access (via Ruby Active Record of course) can speed up queries for data analysis and visualization, for example, avoiding one use case for cached responses of the standard Discourse API.\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:53, topic:10217\"]\nIf we were to write a backend API, we could also have it [\u2026] replace the current Participio.api that is serving Culture Squad and Internet of Humans, [and] we would have a pretty powerful beginning on our own Edgeryders API to extend Discourse to other front end applications.\n[/quote]\n\nThat also applies when extending the Discourse API as outlined above. In fact we _have_ a start of an Edgeryders API that extends Discourse already, so let's proceed there.\n\nProposed work distribution:\n\n* @natalia_skoczylas, @hugi and me do the software design together.\n* @daniel and I do the Discourse API extensions.\n* @hugi and team do the frontend implementation.", "created_at": "2019-07-13 19:31:36.528404", "updated_at": "2019-07-14 00:43:46.395554", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 621, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 17.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [56586], "is_reply_to": [56586], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56283, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9076, "post_number": 60, "raw": "[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:59, topic:9076\"]\nI think I found the solution (or - the cause: differing `ion.rangeSlider` -versions).

You are very welcome to join. I can also send you the notes:\n\n\"How can we ensure not making the same mistakes as with the (failed) smart city (applications), but co-create services in the vertical applications (body/health, home/energy, car/sharing, region/collective intelligence) with all stakeholders including citizens? In this workshop we want to investigate the procedure of embedding these ideas and requirements in a Digital Signature for the Infrastructure. This has the important bonus it no longer matters who hosts the data and which platforms it runs, as the liability, accountability, procurement, GDPR and Cybersecurity Act compliance is in situational contracts (term Christian Nold), thus ensuring the new insights (fostering new services) stay well known to all stakeholders. In earlier workshops of NGI Forward WP3 the realization was made that in these 5G environments all entities (whether persons, goods, objects or situations) will be given federated and temporary identities, as in the case of an accident with the connected car in which all \u2018stakeholders\u2019 (the car, the person, the lantern pole that is hit, the water that the crashes into that is polluted\u2026) receive temporary identities the ensemble of which becomes the \u2018virtual accident\u2019 the liability and accountability is administered on. Currently eIDas is the digital signature for persons, GS1 is providing product codes (\u2018passports\u2019) for goods and coelition.org is mapping and numbering everyday activities. In these environments AI will run in the network and robotic capabilities are built in to function semi-autonomously, the agency to name the combinations of the temporary and federated (attribute-based) identities will be vital to creating new services. Currently this agency is in the hands of GAFA and BAT.\n\nIn the case of architectures the first Salon put forward four building blocks.  The first is that in an Internet of Humans, or Next Generation Internet, trust can be tokenized but only within a situation of already established trust between people, meaning there has to be a social understanding before it can be technically articulated, can we talk about communities and everyday life. The second is successful anticipatory regulation: \u201cjoint-up multidisciplinary regulation through collaboration platforms on AI that include startups, think-tanks and academia, large and medium-sized companies, governments and their ethics commissions, civil society and activists.\u201dThe third is to explore building institution like entities with the concepts of data utilities and the work of Neil Lawrence and Sylvie Delacroix who propose data trusts as a bottom-up mechanism whereby data-subjects choose to pool their data within the legal framework of the Trust. The fourth is to include potential third-party trust providers are seemingly neutral organizations that have a large member base organized around for example mobility (in the Netherlands the ANWB has a membership of 4.446.528 (1-1-2017). In January 2018, for example, the various accounts of FC Barcelona surpassed 180 million engagements worldwide. One could also consider alumni groups of different schools.\"\n\n\"Educate people about these technologies and how to interact with them or possibly avoid them\"\n\nAvoid them? You seriously think that is an option? Where on the planet would you go? I think that is not an option at all. Our job, at least in the CSA NGI for which I am making the case here that is paid with public money of European taxpayers), it is not an option at all to have as a strategic assessment to the European Commission that we should learn Millennials and Igens and older people who can no longer use analogue means for a lot of administrative purposes, to avoid IoT, Big Data, AI, biotech, smart phones, to avoid new technologies. What is the advise? Dress up in aluminium foil? Of course edgeryders is bigger then this project and if the aim of edgeryders is to explore these options (that I also described but discarded as the Unabombers fiction of \u2018going back to nature\u2019 in 2007, I was discarding that as a strategic option for society as a whole and people taking responsibility as leaders for the whole of society. It is of course perfectly possible as an individual option, but then it is a personal choice with a very limited strategic or educational aspect.\n\n\"We have seen the end of the guerilla, as being on the move now is not different anymore than staying in one place and securing it. At the outer ends of this kind of opposition we find the ultimate innere Emigration (inner emigration), the suicide of Menno ter Braak, four days after the Germans invaded the Netherlands, and Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. Menno ter Braak took sedatives and his brother gave him a lethal injection. Drenched in the Nietzschean philosophy of autonomy and ever striving to be a homme honn\u00eate, he could \u2013 being involved in anti-fascist activities from mid-thirties \u2013 see the fascist logic of life very clearly and could not envision any way out. The Innere Emigration of intellectuals in the thirties, retreating into ones own mental sphere, not publishing, not speaking in public, was not only unbearable to him, he realized that it had become ontologically impossible. The Unabomber\u2019s strategy \u2013 killing three and maiming a further 23 \u2013 in trying to get his message across to both a research community and a larger public, has caused a lot of human suffering, landed him in jail and may a have had adverse effects in that the search for him converged new techniques of surveillance. In the end it was his brother that recognised his style. \nAs a core issue in his thinking is his distinction between small-scale technology is technology \u201cthat can be used by small-scale communities without outside assistance\u201d and organization-dependent technology is technology that depends on large-scale social organization\u201d. \nhttps://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/notebook2_theinternetofthings.pdf\nP47\"\n\nMy take on education? I took that challenge in 2010 when I set up April 9 #IoT Day. In ten years over 500 self organized events \n\nIoTDay is an open invitation to the Internet of Things Community to set up an event, a lunch, a talk with the neigborhood on what #IoT is and what it means in everyday life for all of us\n\nHave taken place\nhttps://www.iotday.org\n\nI also run, the local #IOT Meetup in Gent, where I live, so I take my responsibility not only on a global scale but locally as well, what else would be the point we are not here for ego or fame - so in over 30 meetups were done over the years. I could do more and having realized that I am now talking with IMEC in Gent to have more structure.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Internet-of-Things-Ghent/\n\n\"Sabotage the technologies eg blocking the sensors (dangerous, expensive)\"\n\nAnd ridiculous and fully ineffective. Adding more negativity to the already ongoing negativity is pointless and counterproductive. Any action should be communicative, non violent, non negative and fully from the perspective of dialogue.\nIn France over 60% of all traffic cameras have been destroyed. What is the point of that?\nDo you really think Google is the enemy, the smart phone is the 'evil'? Would you rather have lived before the internet? When, in 1500, prior to book printing with priests the only ones reading and you being burned for asking can I read a book?\nOf course it is very sad that the first iterations of the anarchist hippie protocol was taking over by old fashioned greed (Mark Zuckerberg call his first four users dumb fucks) niche intelligence seeing Over The Top openings (intelligence without a heart):Amazon, Uber... and national states like China, Singapore, Malaysia and now quickly Africa, and also US and Europe as all dependencies in, the national states see these surveillance options as a way to sustain their power ( the state - church, Moneyland, military wedding). But and here we differ, you somehow seem to think 'it is over', this is the next normal, to me it is just a phase, and there is no doubt in my mind that the aligned sensibilities in favor of sharing, of cooperation, of common sense are winning. \n\n\"Explore the benefits of living in cities and look for ways to introduce these benefits to local more distributed communities so that living in cities isn\u2019t the only perceived option\"\n\nAbsolutely!\nDo you have links, texts, projects, pointers?

We have also moved all of our university classes online. What the students are missing more than anything is the social atmosphere of the university -- I hear them saying they miss their cohort (these are Masters students), working on class projects and papers together (even just being in the same space, not even collaborating), taking breaks from study together. So much of learning is in the in-between, when formal lectures aren't happening. That stuff is hard to replicate online. \n\nAnd it's interesting that you bring up mental health, @noemi, because I think what we found more than anything in Open Care is that having a strong sense of community massively helps with mental health issues. I just read the book Happy City, and the author finds the same thing --- *ambient* community feeling keeps us happy -- the people we chat to when we go get our morning coffee and all the people we recognise as we go about our daily lives. These points of contact are really important for the students as well -- it's not the formal learning that they're missing the most, it's all the ambient touchpoints that they no longer have. \n\nSpace makes a huge difference -- being at the university brings a sense of scholarly-ness that makes diving into writing easier. These ambient effects are hard to replicate digitally. But people are trying!

I was blessed (in the social dimension of it definitely) with bouncing each week between two workplaces I have at the University, which makes my usual rhythm relatively dynamic. I personally consider the high number of colleagues I meet to be the actual win.\n\nSo we just decided this Tuesday to meet up in three people in our study room/lab and make plans for the rest of the semester/quarantine, taking advantage of the relaxed measures. As the room is big enough, we could keep some safe distance, have a coffee and talk in person. And no one seemed eager to be the first to leave, we actually stood by the door for additional 15 mins. \n\nGenerally, we do not know when the Universities will allow students or public back in, but I hope we will keep these weekly mental revival sessions. Nevertheless, it is a privilege to have basically private premises which can serve such a purpose. The other institute I am teaching at holds weekly meetings of 30-60 people online to make up for the lack of verbal contact, but no one has come up with a \"Shut Up and Write\" online sessions yet, though the institute operates a \"silent room\" under normal circumstances.

[The University and the Undercommons](http://www.iub.edu/~amst/university.pdf) by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney\nThis has become a prolific text among academics and activists and has induced the Undercommoning movement: \"a network of radical organizers within, against, and beyond the (neo)liberal, (neo)colonial university.\" Its success propelled Moten and Harney to write the series of essays that became the even more prolific _Undercommons: Fugtive Planning and Black Study._This thinking has heavily influenced my own research and I was lucky enough to spend some time in residency with Fred and Stefano back in 2016. One of the things I found super powerful was that they see the solution in the social and not the political. This is for many reasons outlined in their work but one that has stuck with me is because the political triages (sorts), and by doing this upholds power dynamics of valuation. Hence my ongoing hesitancy to focus on the political system as we broach solutions (as per some of our conversations @alberto) . \n\n2. [State Work: Public Administration and Mass Intellectuality](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/state-work-stefano-harney/1117334224?type=eBook) by Stefano Harney\nThis is an older work of Harney's from 2002 where he reflects on his own time working in state bureaucratics. \n\"An innovative contribution to political theory, State Work examines the labor of government workers in North America. Arguing that this work needs to be theorized precisely because it is vital to the creation and persistence of the state, Stefano Harney draws on thinking from public administration and organizational sociology, as well as poststructuralist theory and performance studies, to launch a cultural studies of the state. Countering conceptions of the government and its employees as remote and inflexible, Harney uses the theory of mass intellectuality developed by Italian worker-theorists to illuminate the potential for genuine political progress inherent within state work...\"\n\n3.

So hello, Erin. I'm Maria. I work for Edgeryders as a community journalist and manager and art and design researcher. I usually also work from a coworking space here in Stockholm, and I'm very, very interested in hearing your story about how you're developing coworking and why. It would be great if you could start by introducing yourself.\n\nErin:\n\nYeah, absolutely. So thank you so much for having me, and yeah, happy to talk to you all the way over in Sweden. So my name is Erin Westover, and I work with Upflex. We're a New York based company. However, I'm based in Berlin. Of course, at the moment we are 100% remote. But our shtick, if you will, is that we love to promote flexible work styles. That includes coworking. We're huge advocates for coworking spaces and of course remote work and any kind of work that encompasses allowing people to work from where they need to or which makes them more productive and provides professional environments.\n\nErin:\n\nSo what I do specifically for Upflex is that I partner with spaces all over the world. So we have more than 4,000 space partners and more than 8,000 spaces on our platform that we partner with for people that need hot desks or private offices or meeting rooms. What we do is we actually package that and promote it to companies that are looking to implement more of a flexible work environment within their companies, especially during the last couple of years. People have been coming away from the headquartered model of having actual locations where they send their employees to.\n\nErin:\n\nSo we're creating a new product that allows them to let people work from where they need to and create meeting areas rather than a place that you have to be located every day, 9:00 to 5:00, as well as commuting to. Yeah.\n\nMaria:\n\nDo I understand correctly that companies and small teams are among your main clients or members?\n\nErin:\n\nYeah. So typically, platforms like us, there are other ones out there, however, they're more geared toward freelancers or individuals looking for spaces or kind of building their company. We work with established companies and enterprise companies, so large teams that are essentially, maybe they have locations all over the world, and they have headquarters in many cities. Instead of having an office building for 200 people in the middle of Manhattan, why not allow for people to work in Williamsburg and work in Brooklyn and not have to take the trains right into the city center. Right? So creating an option that, or of course, if you want to hire remotely, but still give someone the option to work from a professional environment that suits their job role or suits their working style. Yeah.\n\nMaria:\n\nThat's great. So what key role does technology play in these coworking spaces that you're offering to these distributed teams and companies?\n\nErin:\n\nSo again, we are a technology platform. So it is an application that allows for companies. They can white label the app to... Let's use Coca-Cola, for example. They're not a client of ours, but let's hope one day they might be. But we could brand the app to have Coca-Cola logos. So when the employee is logging in, they're going to see that it's a company app rather than they're just using the third-party Upflex. So it's integrated with their culture. That's the idea. Then this app communicates with all of our spaces. It notifies them when people are coming and allows them to control their inventory online. So it's definitely like, I guess, a workspace that is put online until you actually physically go and check into the location.\n\nErin:\n\nWith regards to technology and how that interacts, there's a lot of ways that coworking spaces are using technology in order to mitigate certain issues or just make the experience a lot more simplified. So we're of course looking to do integrations in the future, but there are inventory controls where they can put those online and have providers like us be able to tap into their inventory of what's available in their space, whether it be meeting rooms, private offices or hot desking. So there is that component. There is also accessible options. So using keyless entry, you can do that through the app, and that can be integrated with their own systems that are in their buildings. So people can walk in and have a touchless system, and they know that that person has entered the building through those integrations.\n\nErin:\n\nSo technology plays a really big role in how coworking spaces are trying to develop the best experience possible, the most seamless experience possible. Of course, it is the future. I think people are really drawn to that aspect of things, and when we're trying to develop a new work style, that's always of interest to us using technology, whether it be for data or information and as well as making the process a lot more simplified.\n\nMaria:\n\nSo would you say you are a technology platform first and foremost, that then works with coworking spaces and the companies working there, enabling them to connect?\n\nErin:\n\nAbsolutely. So we don't have a product other than that. Our inventory doesn't belong to us. So it's all independent operators or business centers. They own their own real estate. So we provide essentially a platform for all of those communications to happen. So we are definitely, first and foremost, a technology platform. Yeah.\n\nMaria:\n\nOkay, great. In that context, I would be very curious about what happened to you when, well, COVID hit and everybody had to rely highly on those technologies to get connected. Did you see any shifts? How are you going from here? What changed?\n\nErin:\n\nYeah. So this is going to be a long-winded story because it comes in. A lot happened since COVID, but as you know, the remote working industry, we're really pushing our ideals, and we see that this is going to be the future. So our product was a little bit early, right? So when people are coming in, and we're speaking to companies, they didn't see that this would be an option for them. So it was a lot of preaching that goes on and teaching people and helping them understand, yeah, this is a great option for your company and even talking to the spaces and seeing if this is something that would be valuable to them. Then all of a sudden COVID hits, and then we got launched right onto the front lines of people realizing, okay, we don't want to have a 10-year lease anymore with our company. That's way too expensive.\n\nErin:\n\nHere we are locked in. We can't get out of a lease. We need something more flexible. Not only that these companies are experiencing remote work for the first time, in some cases, right, because all of their teams were just sent home to work, and they're trying to navigate how Zoom works and how they can still run their companies without being in each other's space. Right? So all of that happened, which immediately created inquiries for us and how companies are planning for the future.\n\nErin:\n\nSo both on the space side and the client side, we've really had a huge influx of people inquiring about our company and fully understanding and embracing what it is that we were trying to bring to the market. So that's a really huge deal. So our projections, the statistics we had, all of the information that we had and as a group in the remote work industry, I think we're projecting this to be more realistic for next year. I don't think that we were really anticipating this quickly, all these companies going, \"Hey, wait a minute. Yeah, this works.\"\n\nErin:\n\nSo that was the first thing for our product, which of course is a really good thing for us. It's too bad that it had to be such a horrible incident for people to realize this. So that was the first thing that happened. Then internally, we preach remote work, but I'm going to be honest that our company's still required a lot of attendance. So the New York office, they have a small team there and our CEO, Christophe really liked people coming into the office because he's that kind of person that's really social. He likes to brainstorm and be there in person. I've been remote the entire time that I've worked for Upflex. But all of our team was forced to go remote and start testing what it is that we do and testing our model.\n\nErin:\n\nI must say it's been a really big surprise to Christophe as well that we all really came together, we made it work, and we were all way more productive. So as much as they don't want to admit it, it really, really changed things. I also was way more pulled into the team, more included in the team because all of us were online and there and present instead of our weekly meeting or catch-up. So that was a really great learning experience for us, and I know that that's something we're going to carry forward now, and Christophe has converted into, \"Yeah. However you guys want to work, let's actually practice what we've preached.\"\n\nErin:\n\nSo that happened. Then from there, we created a really amazing product out of this. So of course, you have to be working on your toes. How are we going to be in the post COVID-19 world? How is that going to look and function? It ended up that we created a program called Safe Spaces, and we created a seal in partnership with Colliers International, which is a major real estate brokerage company. They saw the benefit of our product. What we decided, or what we realized is that people are going to have a hard time returning to the workplace because of, is it safe? Should I be leaving my home? If I'm going to be in a space with other people, is this okay? Then a lot of people that were working from home that actually don't enjoy that or they have kids or there's all these different things that don't allow for their space to allow for a professional environment.\n\nErin:\n\nBut how do we take a bridge for the employees to feel safe and also the spaces to be able to welcome people back in a safe and healthy manner to make sure that everyone is feeling like this is a good decision to move your company back into the workplace. So we develop that, and it's a bridge program where you can now filter for spaces that are adhering to local regulations. So for example, in the United States, it's CDC and obviously the who, and then of course, whatever they want to implement themselves. So a lot of spaces are even putting temperature regulators or a way that you can walk past, and they can determine if somebody has a temperature. So some spaces have even gone to that extent. That's not a requirement by any means, but they went above and beyond.\n\nErin:\n\nOf course, creating space between their desks. So the WeWork model, which used to be you're shoulder to shoulder with a lot of people, that is no longer the case. So they have to implement the certain measurements to allow for people to return and have their own space or providing more enclosed areas and maybe not going into the open concept. So lots has changed. We've also become kind of a beacon for people and spaces to say or to understand what it is that they can do in order to get ready to have people return to work. So there's been a lot of educating in that regard and communicating, \"Okay, this is what's happening with our partners in China. This is what's worked for them. Okay. Let's bring that model over to Europe, and then of course, extend that to the United States.\" So a lot of communication and just really focusing on getting that bridge to bring people back to the workplace. Long winded.\n\nMaria:\n\nNo, no. That's super interesting. One of the things I wanted to ask from here is... So what came through a few of the interviews that we already did now is that, yeah, a lot has changed, but also, a lot of coworking spaces, even though they are adapting a lot, they are not investing in new technologies or changes right now because everything changes so fast. What are you recommending and that tends to your clients because you said you've become this beacon?\n\nErin:\n\nWell, I would say, with regards to technology, the most important thing would probably be to partner with companies like ourselves, like Upflex or people that are able to, whether it's bring extra people in and fill your space in a time where a lot of people aren't going there or a time where coworking has really suffered. We have to be honest about that, that that was one of the first things to go, was to take people out of the office, right, and put them in their homes and work from there, of course, with the jobs that we have, right, not essential workers that are going out into the world. But people who can operate online were taken out of the workplace. So a lot of coworking places got hit hard. A lot of coworking spaces also operate on a month-to-month basis.\n\nErin:\n\nSo that's what part of the appeal is, is that I can go and have a one month contract and then cancel it at any time so I'm not buying real estate for 10 years or something. So these companies suffered a lot from that because if you have all these short-term rentals, they're immediately going to cancel their contract, and then you don't have any clients. So using technology platforms like ourselves and companies that are advocating space and also doing a lot of blogging and a lot of communication and things like what we're doing right now and educating that way, that's a really great way to get your space recognized, and people who might not know that you exist, it's a great way to advertise yourself. Even if you don't necessarily get customers directly through that platform, it's a way to get your name out there.\n\nErin:\n\nSo I think that's really important. Like I said, the safety component is really important for people, and everybody wants to know, \"Okay, what's going to happen. What is it going to look like when I returned? Because I don't want to be sitting across from somebody that I don't know. I do want to be safe because then I have to go home to my family. But on the other hand, I really need to get back out of my house or get back into the workplace.\" So there's lots of technology that can help you with that. It can be quite expensive. So you need to kind of pick and choose during this time of what's most important. But I do think the keyless entry is going to be a huge thing for people.\n\nErin:\n\nTouchless. Everyone's talking about touch surfaces, and this is the big trend right now. You don't want to touch anything on necessarily in a public space. So having access, purchasing through your phone, having everything, all of your merchandise or anything that you want to purchase, whether it be a meeting room within this space, all of that can be managed through apps and through technology that is specifically geared toward coworking spaces and helping that be functional. Then any of those technologies that existed before COVID have been adapting to COVID and making sure that it's functioning for the needs of what's to come and the restructuring.\n\nMaria:\n\nOkay, great. Then I wanted to ask a bit more about your experience from what you knew about before together with the intense user testing you've done the last few months, yourself and your team about what you think is among really, really important features for a remote team to work together profile.\n\nErin:\n\nSo this is a discussion that we are always having because again, being a technology company, a lot of our information is stored in a cloud already. So luckily for us, we've been doing that. One thing that our CPO, Ginger Dhaliwal, she is always making us write everything down. In every meeting, we're typing it out, we're typing it out. There's documentation. Again, this over-communication thing, which I get really bothered by if someone asks me many, many times, something that I felt that I have already been very clear about, I've had to reflect on myself and understand that's a really important thing to be doing is that communicate everything all the time. You're not there in person. Then when you go away to have your day, and you're not there to remind people what's going on, it's really important to continuously repeat information.\n\nErin:\n\nSo recording the information, storing it where it's accessible and having a map so that people can access all that information, that's the best way to handle it so that I can go and grab a document. I don't have to ask my colleague where it is and communicating that all the time. Of course, meetings. I don't love having a million meetings all the time because it is very disruptive. I feel like when teams are remote, they do it in almost as a way to show, \"Hey, I'm here, and I'm working. I'm online. The little light is on, on my Slack that shows I'm live.\" I don't really subscribe to that. I'm really like, \"Let's have meetings if we need them.\" Because the flow of my day it gets disrupted. That's a huge thing that happens in the office space, right?\n\nErin:\n\nSo the amount of productivity and work you can get done if you limit your meeting time. Of course, keep them for strategy or if you're building something together or have, of course, your team meetings, you're all-hand meetings. But jumping on a million calls a day with your colleagues just because they're not in the office beside you to talk and respecting that time I felt has really worked. But this is stuff we've talked about. Right? So I've had to be really vocal like, \"Hey, this doesn't need to be a meeting. Send me an email.\" Stuff like that. That's been working for us. But with regards to technology, there's just not so much that you need. It all depends on what you're doing. Right? Zoom has been amazing. We like Zoom. It works for us, and of course, just having the cloud, everything mapped out and accessible so that you can find all the information and documents you need in order to do your job effectively.\n\nMaria:\n\nGreat. So from here, with all you've learned, and then the last few months, what are your thoughts on the future?\n\nErin:\n\nSo I guess I can speak to the coworking industry because of what the topic is here and what the future is going to be. Again, like I had mentioned, they took one of the heavier hits in the market. So there are a lot of spaces, unfortunately, that won't make it through COVID because of the month-to-month contracts and the way things went in that regard, or they were just starting out or even some of the bigger players, they didn't have a lot of money in the bank, so to speak. So they might've been also going month to month because they were doing fundraising or VC, things like that.\n\nErin:\n\nSo it is possible that some of the bigger players that we're used to seeing might be acquired by someone else. So that is probably going to be the future. However, as much as they were hit hard and we lost a lot of spaces, and we'll continue to lose spaces over the year, coworking is going to come back stronger than ever. It's going to be needed more than ever. That is because of the transition of companies coming away from the headquartered model, wanting a more flexible lease and also this huge realization that, \"Yes, we can work remotely. I don't need to have my team all in one space, five days a week, eight hours a day.\"\n\nErin:\n\nSo that shift is going to happen, and coworking spaces will be inundated with clients, and of course, adjusting to these flexible models and kind of changing even their space and what the requirements are. So for example, I love hot desking. I like walking into a space and just popping my computer open and feeling whatever perspective I want to have that day, instead of having my own dedicated, desperate work every day. That's not really how I operate.\n\nErin:\n\nHowever, a lot of these spaces are going to be taking that element away for a while because the open concept is not so safe. It's not really something that I think people want to be doing. Even companies that had open space offices within a coworking space, so maybe for 20 of their people, they're going to start creating boundaries between the people that are working there. So whether it be screams or if they spread people out a little bit more. So the design of the spaces will change. Then of course, the influx of customers is going to change. It's going to take some time, probably like fall to later in the year. But people will want to return to work. They don't want to work from home. But they also know that they don't want to commute to the office five days a week again.\n\nErin:\n\nSo somewhere in between is what the future is going to be. Then of course, making sure that the spaces can accommodate a certain amount of people, which again, may change the affordability of things because if you're not using every little square foot that you have or square meter that you have, creating more spacing, that can create a different pricing model. So I'm interested to see how that will also be affected.\n\nMaria:\n\nYou also already observed some changes in where the coworking space is localized in rural or urban area. Are there changes happening? Or is it too early for that?\n\nErin:\n\nNo, definitely not. After also taking to consideration that every single country, even every district within a country is different right now with how they're handling things. So the United States, it's a very good example of places that are open and places that are not open. So from state to state, it's different.\n\nErin:\n\nRural coworking, I think they're going to suffer the most, unfortunately. If they were able to get government help, that's great if they could stay open. But I think if they can hold on, there's going to be a huge driver there, and that's something that I've been advocating for, and I always try to partner with spaces in rural areas because those are the places where people want to live and work from. They don't need to be in the city center to do their job effectively. So I do believe more of those spaces will start popping up. Hopefully, some are able to make it through this time, financially they will be. But they know that they have to be on board with these health and safety regulations in order to make the space feel safe for others.\n\nErin:\n\nSo I've been communicating with spaces all over, some that are in smaller towns or that are wanting to open during this time because the demand is starting to increase. But it's always going to be regional. It's always going to be based on the regulations, how far along they are and the reopening process after lockdown. But I do think that some of these methods and precautions are here to stay. The spacing issue, I think, is really going to be a thing because people didn't like that to begin with. You don't want someone in your direct vicinity. So that's going to be something that will be taken into the future. But yeah, it's nice that you mentioned the rural coworking. I'm a huge advocate for that, and people should just be able to work from where they need to.\n\nMaria:\n\nAnother pattern view that I would like to ask you if you have insight on is, do you see already different membership models emerging?\n\nErin:\n\nYeah. Absolutely. So at the moment, a lot of spaces immediately took away their day use. So you can't just be a random person walking in off the street anymore, booking a day pass at a coworking space. A lot of people took that away. A lot of spaces took that away. Of course, it's because they wanted to cater to their own membership. If they're already only allowed to occupy maybe 60% of their space or 50% of their space, they have to first and foremost address their members that stayed with them during that time, making them feel safe, making sure they can return. So any flexibility memberships went out the window, to begin with because they just can't allow for strangers to come in, or they just can't occupy the space because they're operating at a percentage of their capacity.\n\nErin:\n\nSo that is something that's been going on. So during these months, a lot of them did restructure their pricing model, or they removed a whole aspect of their membership, and then they were going into long term. Some people, like I said, reconstructed their offices completely and took away all the open areas and made them enclosed and maximized that. For example, we actually reevaluated our membership pricing. So we are a membership-based platform up at Upflex. We realized where the demand is coming in. So no, we knew that people are scared to be in open spaces with strangers or even with their colleagues. So we created a product, which is private offices for durations. So flexible private offices, whether it be by the day so that a team can go into an enclosed area and work together and do some strategy if they need to be together in person. Or you can do that by the week or by the month, depending on how long.\n\nErin:\n\nThen of course, if those people are done after a certain project, they can go back to their perspective environments and wherever they were working for or from previously. So for that, we've changed our product to accommodate that and accommodate what clients are actually asking for. Then of course, we're taking that to our spaces and letting them know, \"Hey, this is what everyone's asking for.\" You might want to consider reflecting the demand. I've noticed that a lot of people are going to that. That is the prediction.\n\nErin:\n\nSo yeah. I do see that the flexibility model is not going to go away completely. I think the day passes will not be so popular for a little while. But the flexibility is going to come into play, and then the memberships will have to reflect that.\n\nMaria:\n\nAt this point, where do you see the biggest challenges to be overcome and the role technology plays in that?\n\nErin:\n\nSo that's a really good question. Things to overcome. That's a tough one. Can you give me some perspective on what you mean by that or maybe an example of how you would see that?\n\nMaria:\n\nSo how do you make sure that people feel safe and can develop long-term working situations at the coworking spaces, or how can you make sure that enough of the coworking spaces stay even in business for them to be an infrastructure, be available in one year, two years? But yeah. From your perspective, what is something that... What is the biggest technological challenges that need to be faced to get through this crisis?\n\nErin:\n\nSo when we talk about technology, I wouldn't say what's currently out there and available. I think that's already helping the spaces, of course. But when we talk about technology, we can also just talk about internet and communication and getting the word out. I think if that is the best way to mitigate these issues or to stay in business, for example, and again, partnerships, making sure that everyone knows who you are, that you're talking to people, that you're talking to the right people. If you want to talk about rural coworking or even just intercity coworking, get involved in your community as much as possible and find ways to make sure people know who you are and know that you exist, know that you have inventory like that, and also know that there is a solution to working from home.\n\nErin:\n\nSo again, lots of communication, lots online. Again, what we're doing is really important here today and having those types of conversations. A good example, I guess, would be Knotel there are quite a major company out of New York City, and they're in many locations. They were shut down when New York was shut down, and they weren't able to operate. So what they did was they used their space and provided it to essential workers for a place to rest or some nurses and doctors, if they just need a place to lay down or somewhere to go to be alone or whatever it is, maybe to just eat and decompress without having to leave the city if they needed to be in proximity to the hospital or where they were working, or even if they couldn't go home, for example, because they might infect their family during this time.\n\nErin:\n\nSo they used their space during a really hard time, and that got them a lot of publicity. I'm not saying, \"Oh, they just did it to get the publicity.\" But it was really valuable to their branding and to their company and what they represent and when they stepped up during a really hard time and offered their spaces at no cost to people that really needed it. So things like that. Again, like I said, getting involved in your community and ensuring that communication is there and providing education like this to people that are looking to maybe get into the coworking space. But all of that can be done online. I think that's the best way to go. But otherwise, coworking is an in-person experience.\n\nErin:\n\nSo technology plays a certain role in it. But I would say that just use the internet and use your networks and get to know people. Yeah. Another example would be the UK. I know they were having a lot of trouble actually getting financial support as coworking space operators, which is really troubling. They were signing petitions and trying to get the government to actually recognize and provide them with these bailouts that a lot of other people were entitled to in getting, whether it be unemployment, et cetera, and they somehow fell into this no man's land, and they weren't eligible for this type of compensation.\n\nErin:\n\nSo as a space, you need to be motivated to go out and ask for that type of help and spread the word. There was a lot of petitions that were signed. I think it was eventually overturned, and they were able to get some financial assistance. But understanding how valuable spaces within a community and what they actually bring to the community, if that was recognized by the government, and now that it is recognized by the government, they understand the value, right? So that's a great way to stay in business during this time when you're having financial hardship or you don't know where you're going to be in the next six months.\n\nMaria:\n\nSo I'm able to say the key thing right now is for people to learn about the possibilities of remote work of coworking and therefore being able to appreciate that and to keep that alive. Maybe the last thing. What are the solutions that a platform like yours could provide to enable people to learn about how to work remotely or work better remotely? Yeah. What is the main thing that you see there as an importance?\n\nErin:\n\nYeah. So again, we are advocates within our company, and we do partner with a lot of education platforms. So we aren't an education platform. It just so happens that continuously, we are educating people through our product and by giving the option and making it available. So partnerships with these education platforms, which there are many out there, we do promote them on our site. We promote them to companies that are considering using our product. So having a nice network is really great to offer those things where you might have a weakness.\n\nErin:\n\nHowever, we do provide a lot of recommendations as to how you can structure your team. So there might be a team that needs an office of 20 people, and that's okay. That's okay if you want to go and have that routine. Some people need it. Some people like it. But there might be five people on your team that don't, and they want to work from home, and then there might be another five that really enjoy working from coworking spaces or one that's a little closer to their home.\n\nErin:\n\nSo our platform allows you to manage that or develop a system so that everybody can work the way that they need. That's what we're really trying to do to make it as flexible as possible to have the most diverse team and the most functional aspect of flexibility that you can. But again, the education component needs to be left to the professionals, and there's so many out there. There's so many great resources, even ROE remote. That's a great way to learn how you can do that and implement it. It's going to forever be ongoing education, right? Because I think the industry is pretty new, and technology keeps developing, so staying on your toes and really knowing what you can provide to your clients and making sure that they're getting the best resources available to them to make sure that this works and everyone's happy.\n\nMaria:\n\nOkay, great. Thank you very much. I think this is also a good point to invite ROE remote back into our conversation.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nHi.\n\nErin:\n\nHi.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nHi. So Erin, that was really good. A couple of comments or further clarifications if it's okay. I was making notes.\n\nErin:\n\nAll right.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nSo you said you partnered with a big provider, Erin, in terms of that, Safe Spaces. What was the name? Are they a property? I just missed the-\n\nErin:\n\nThat's Colliers. Colliers International.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nColliers. Yeah. That's what I thought you did say, and I know them. So I just wanted to make sure I had that right. Then Erin, just a general question on the profile of some of the smaller spaces that may load inventory onto your system just because I'm sitting in one of the few... There's only three or four coworking in Zaragoza. Okay? The one I'm sitting in is an independent one. It doesn't have 24-hour access, which is an issue. Right? Also, I'm actually looking at moving to one because we're going down to Tarragona for the summer and-\n\nErin:\n\n[crosstalk 00:36:16]-\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\n... [inaudible 00:36:16] in Cambrils, which is the same thing, a coworking in Cambrils, which is the same thing. So they're small, independent. So I've just been noticing potentially whether I'm thinking about when I was listening to you, if I put myself in the position of an independent owner who may have because this is a huge space, have extra space that they may want to load on to inventory, then you're mentioning Colliers, for example. I just want to understand what percentage potentially of your base is independent, Erin, or kind of how they fit into your overall model in terms of inventory being loaded.\n\nErin:\n\nYou mean like an independent worker, like an independent employee?\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nNo, like an-\n\nMaria:\n\nOr independent space.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nYeah, an independent space. Do you know that?\n\nErin:\n\nSo yeah. So we have many, many on our platform. Again, I don't want to speak against any of our partners, but I love independent spaces. These are the ones that have character and really interesting communities. So I think they're really important to include. Again, we have many on our platform. If you are to use your inventory, so you need to also consider what you have and what's empty and how you want to leverage it. So again, we allow for you to put one hot desk on our platform if you want, or you can have 10 meeting rooms and 50 private offices and 60 spaces for hot desking, depending on your capacity. So it's up to you to control it as the owner or the manager at the space. So you can go on and take it away and add it as you need to as much as you want.\n\nErin:\n\nBut really considering short term and not always committing to, \"Oh, I need somebody in here for a month.\" What if there is a team of four people that just need a space for two days? Would you rather it sit empty, or would you rather people be in there? So finding ways to do that and fill the space during times may be taking a little less money than you'd normally would. It's better to utilize and leverage that inventory, especially during this time when it's uncertain and people are just wanting to dip their toe in the water. So that's a really great way to do it. Put the inventory online. The requests come in 24 hours in advance. So if you just happen to fill them, we just can communicate that to our client and say, \"Actually, the space is unavailable.\"\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nOkay, great. Can I check then, is there an initial cost just to load the inventory or no?\n\nErin:\n\nAbsolutely no. No. So-\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nPerfect. That was what I was double-checking. Then wondering, for example, the bigger... I didn't see them on your list, but if we take, say Impactop, for example, do you have Impactop, some of them loading?\n\nErin:\n\nOh, we have some of them. But we'd love to have their entire inventory. But it's very difficult because they have almost like a franchise model, right?\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThey do. Yeah.\n\nErin:\n\nEveryone's an independent owner. So there's not really one person I can go to, and we get them all on. I have to talk to them as individuals. So we do. Actually, we have Impactop [inaudible 00:39:24]. We do have several on our platform, but we don't have all of them, but they have some amazing coverage. But we have partnered with some really massive companies in the last couple of months. WeWork is now a partner of ours. So we have about 700 of their locations on our platform, industrious, and of course, Talent Garden, which is a really great one here in New York. But it's fantastic. So there are lots and lots of spaces all over, and again, they pick and choose how busy that space is, and they adjust their inventory accordingly.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nOkay. Because that's what's interesting for me that there is no barrier. To make that clear, I want that to be clear, and I've made some notes. To an independent owner who can meet the requirements for safety, who has maybe a separate space that they can load. It doesn't the inventory on. It doesn't cost them anything. Then because I'm not sure that that's known in all of the communities, Erin, just to say to you, that's-\n\nErin:\n\nCould be. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nCould be. I know you're doing good marketing, or to understand a little bit more about maybe why people know about it, and then they still don't potentially get that as the option. But yeah. That was really interesting. There was nothing else I don't think I wanted to clarify. I checked on Colliers. Maria, with that extra question or clarification, was there anything else you wanted to ask or all good?\n\nMaria:\n\nI have no question at this point, but I find it very, very interesting how knowing what is possible is such a key issue for solving this whole situation.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nYeah, it is. It is. The people don't realize. Actually, also Erin, just so you know, your access, if you can provide that 24-hour access, I think you're providing that through a third party. Are you, the access system?\n\nErin:\n\nWell, I'll just give an example, one that I'm a really big fan of. There are several out there, but one I'm a really big fan of. I know the founders there. They're great guys, and they've built a great product, is Kisi, so that's K-I-S-I. We aren't integrated with them yet. But they have their own separate app and keyless entry, or you can [inaudible 00:41:38] card entry. A lot of spaces, especially in the United States... They are a German company I believe, but they are based out of New York. Every space that I know in New York City uses Kisi, and it's super convenient, and it's also a great way for the space to know who's in their building as well. Right? So for safety, for security it's really great.\n\nErin:\n\nThen of course, for this touchless entry, and maybe you don't want to interact with a person and have a receptionist lead you around and speak to you or have someone that has to be there, this is a great way to overcome that and also to allow for 24-hour access when maybe you don't want to be there, and you just want to allow your members to come in and work late.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nOkay. Can I just check the spelling of that? Thanks, Erin. I'm just checking, how you spell it again. I'm just looking for their website, actually.\n\nErin:\n\nK-I-S-I.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nK-I-S-I.\n\nErin:\n\nKisi, it's pronounced.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nKeyless entry [inaudible 00:42:39] come up under. I'm using Dr. Go, which doesn't always... Here we go. I found them, getkisi.com. Okay. Perfect. That's good. They haven't come up yet, just so you know, interestingly, and some of our interviews. But that's really good, and that might be something that we follow up on as well. So thanks for that.\n\nErin:\n\nNo, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nWe've done an interview with Nacho, and he's using a different company on Gran Canaria, and they're actually a garage door entry company, who by chance have moved into coworking.\n\nErin:\n\nWow.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nYou cannot find out anything about them. I was laughing saying, if they didn't do good marketing, no wonder some coworking are going, \"How do I actually find out about this?\" So I think you also made the comment that some of this is new. It's a new industry. I think there's a lot of evidence of that, that things are still not bedding down. You also validated that when you said you've become the beacon for information about stage GNDs in response to COVID. So that was really interesting too. Now, if it's okay, can we stop recording, Maria? Because I want to ask Erin a-", "created_at": "2020-07-07 12:20:29.999047", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 12:22:27.649604", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7724, "wiki": true, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3724, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3691, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Natalia is finally in Matera!

S\u0142ysza\u0142am, \u017ce rz\u0105d ma pomys\u0142, \u017ceby zalepi\u0107 t\u0105 dziur\u0119 Filipi\u0144czykami, Hindusami czyli znowu zewn\u0119trzn\u0105 si\u0142\u0105 robocz\u0105, kt\u00f3r\u0105 mo\u017cna \u0142atwo eksploatowa\u0107. \n\nA co si\u0119 dzieje wewn\u0119trznie? Nadal w Polsce s\u0105 miejsca gdzie to bezrobocie jest bardzo wysokie i si\u0119ga powy\u017cej 20%. Ca\u0142y czas brakuje sensownych rozwi\u0105za\u0144 dla rodzimych przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w a rozdawanie pieni\u0119dzy na r\u00f3\u017cne programy \u201e+\u201d pot\u0119guje tylko t\u0105 sytuacj\u0119. Za ma\u0142o inwestuje si\u0119 w nowe technologie, w efektywn\u0105 edukacj\u0119, nadal przedsi\u0119biorca czy podatnik na wej\u015bciu traktowany jest jak oszust, rzuca mu si\u0119 pod nogi k\u0142ody tak, \u017ce og\u00f3lnie jest bardzo trudno utrzyma\u0107 g\u0142ow\u0119 na powierzchni i prowadzi\u0107 w Polsce firm\u0119. G\u0142\u00f3wn\u0105 przeszkod\u0105 dla przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w s\u0105 bardzo wysokie koszty pracy, wysokie podatki, ogromnie rozbudowana biurokracja oraz brak odpowiednio wykwalifikowanych pracownik\u00f3w np. bardzo brakuje specjalist\u00f3w od IT. To powoduje, \u017ce firmy nie mog\u0105 si\u0119 rozwija\u0107. \n\nUrz\u0119dy Pracy to jakie\u015b relikty przesz\u0142o\u015bci, kt\u00f3re nie wiadomo po co s\u0105. Osobi\u015bcie nie znam nikogo kto by znalaz\u0142 zatrudnienie przez Urz\u0105d Pracy.  Jeszcze odno\u015bnie systemu edukacji, kt\u00f3ry ma przygotowywa\u0107 ludzi do wej\u015bcia na rynek pracy. To te\u017c jest klapa. Teraz prawie ka\u017cdy ko\u0144czy studia co w efekcie prowadzi do tego, \u017ce mamy ca\u0142e armie ludzi z dyplomami ale cz\u0119sto bez konkretnych zdolno\u015bci czy umiej\u0119tno\u015bci, nieumiej\u0105cych my\u015ble\u0107 niezale\u017cnie i krytycznie. To powoduje, \u017ce slogany pt. \u201esko\u0144cz studia znajdziesz dobr\u0105 prac\u0119\u201d s\u0105 mitem. Edukacja u nas nie nad\u0105\u017ca lub nie jest dopasowana do rynku pracy to powoduje, \u017ce oczekiwania m\u0142odych ludzi s\u0105 niespe\u0142nione a to rodzi ogromn\u0105 frustracj\u0119. A przekwalifikowa\u0107 si\u0119 jest nie jest prosto. \n\nM\u00f3wi si\u0119, \u017ce w nast\u0119pnych latach ludzie b\u0119d\u0105 kilkakrotnie zmienia\u0107 zaw\u00f3d, s\u0105 na ten temat r\u00f3\u017cne raporty, artyku\u0142y ale ja tego u nas nie wiedz\u0119. Brakuje jakiego\u015b systemowego podej\u015bcia do tych przekwalifikowa\u0144. Wystarczy popatrze\u0107 na og\u0142oszenia o prac\u0119. Jest niewiele og\u0142osze\u0144 elastycznych odnosz\u0105cych si\u0119 do zestaw\u00f3w  kompetencji w zamian mamy \u201e5 lat na stanowisku kierowniczym, po ekonomii lub zarz\u0105dzaniu\u201d. Je\u015bli jeste\u015b  osob\u0105 w wieku 30+ to oczekuj\u0105 od ciebie paru lat do\u015bwiadczenia, wi\u0119c nie ma tu miejsca na to, \u017ce \u201emy ci\u0119 przeszkolimy, wdro\u017cymy w nowe zadania\u201d. Przez co ludzie cho\u0107 maj\u0105 obiektywne cechy, kompetencje czy jakie\u015b pocz\u0105tkowe i dobrze rokuj\u0105ce umiej\u0119tno\u015bci nie dostaj\u0105 takiej szansy na zmian\u0119 i z zwi\u0105zku z tym tkwi\u0105 latami na tych samych stanowiskach. \n\nSama jestem chyba te\u017c \u201dofiar\u0105\u201d takiej sytuacji. Jestem event menagerem. Praca jest og\u00f3lnie ok, ale po 5 latach chcia\u0142abym ju\u017c robi\u0107 co\u015b innego, nie chc\u0119 ju\u017c wyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107 tak cz\u0119sto, ani pracowa\u0107 wieczorami lub w weekendy. Wysy\u0142am CV w odpowiedzi na og\u0142oszenia typu koordynator projektu np. edukacyjnego, asystentk\u0119 zarz\u0105du w r\u00f3\u017cnych firmach i ten odzew jest s\u0142aby. By\u0142am na 7 rozmowach ale nie zosta\u0142am przyj\u0119ta. Nie otrzyma\u0142am \u017cadnego feedbacku wi\u0119c nie wiem dlaczego tak si\u0119 sta\u0142o. Z drugiej strony oferowane zarobki w tych zawodach oscyluj\u0105 pomi\u0119dzy 3000 maksymalnie 4000 z\u0142 netto wi\u0119c to jest to mniej ni\u017c zarabiam aktualnie. Bior\u0105c pod uwag\u0119 jak ten rynek u nas jest skonstruowany wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce powinnam zainwestowa\u0107 w jakie\u015b dobre studia podyplomowe lub bardzo specjalistyczny kurs np. w obszarze grafiki lub zarz\u0105dzania projektami a potem szuka\u0107 pracy po znajomo\u015bci bo wtedy jest szansa, \u017ce kto\u015b mi zaufa bez tych 5 lat do\u015bwiadczenia. \n\nOg\u00f3lnie my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce sytuacja na rynku dla os\u00f3b 30+ (np. kto\u015b nie trafi\u0142 ze studiami i chce co\u015b z tym fantem zrobi\u0107) a szczeg\u00f3lnie 40+ nie jest dobra w kontek\u015bcie przekwalifikowywania si\u0119 i budowania second career. M\u00f3wi si\u0119 o uczeniu si\u0119 przez ca\u0142e \u017cycie, s\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cne platformy, nawet darmowe kursy ale mam poczucie, \u017ce to si\u0119 dzieje gdzie\u015b indziej, \u017ce gdzie indziej jest promowane i doceniane. A szkoda bo to rzesze ludzi stoi w miejscu. Wed\u0142ug mnie zdecydowanie brakuje doradztwa w zakresie jak si\u0119 przekwalifikowa\u0107, \u017ceby wykonywa\u0107 satysfakcjonuj\u0105c\u0105 prac\u0119 i wykorzystywa\u0107 swoje talenty, jak m\u0105drze wybra\u0107 co\u015b z oferty edukacyjnej \u017ceby si\u0119 sensownie doszkoli\u0107. A z drugiej strony na takich pracownik\u00f3w musi by\u0107 popyt, musia\u0142aby zaj\u015b\u0107 zmiana w podej\u015bciu pracodawc\u00f3w w kierunku wi\u0119kszej elastyczno\u015bci. \n\nBy\u0142 taki moment, \u017ce my\u015bla\u0142am, \u017ceby przej\u015b\u0107 na w\u0142asn\u0105 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcz\u0105 ale u nas jest to droga \u201dimpreza\u201d. Po dw\u00f3ch latach preferencyjnych sk\u0142adek koszty prowadzenia firmy zaczynaj\u0105 si\u0119 bardzo wysokie. Nie ma praktycznie \u017cadnych ulg, dofinansowa\u0144, kt\u00f3re pomog\u0142yby rozwija\u0107 si\u0119 takiej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci. W zwi\u0105zku z czym siedz\u0119 cicho na etacie, w ramach kt\u00f3rego co miesi\u0105c mam zabierane 30% pensji, nie wspominaj\u0105c o tym, \u017ce \u0142\u0105czny koszt pracodawcy, kt\u00f3ry mnie zatrudnia wynosi prawie 60%. Mam wra\u017cenie, \u017ce ludziom, kt\u00f3rzy chc\u0105 co\u015b robi\u0107, dzia\u0142a\u0107, zatrudnia\u0107 samych siebie czy innych ju\u017c nawet nie o to chodzi, \u017ce si\u0119 nie pomaga tylko bardzo przeszkadza. Jest to bardzo deprymuj\u0105ce i w gruncie rzeczy druzgoc\u0105ce, \u017ce rz\u0105d (i poprzedni i ten) w taki spos\u00f3b traktuje samodzielne inicjatywy i branie za siebie odpowiedzialno\u015bci. To rodzi poczucie totalnej bezsilno\u015bci, odbijania si\u0119 od \u015bcian.\n\nDlatego rozumiem, \u017ce niekt\u00f3re postulaty Korwina czy pogl\u0105dy Cejrowskiego (cho\u0107 to nie polityk) dotycz\u0105ce liberalizacji gospodarki, wolno\u015bci zatrudnienia/dzia\u0142ania bardzo do cz\u0119\u015bci os\u00f3b przemawiaj\u0105. Oczywi\u015bcie s\u0105 radyklane a czasami wr\u0119cz szokuj\u0105ce (np. wypowiedzi odno\u015bnie zabrania praw wyborczych kobietom)  lub cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 z nich nie jest mo\u017cliwa do wdro\u017cenia w kszta\u0142cie jaki obydwaj proponuj\u0105 (np. zniesienie podatk\u00f3w, likwidacja ZUS-u) ale stanowi\u0105 przeciwwag\u0119 w stosunku do tego co proponowa\u0142o wcze\u015bniej PO czy teraz PIS w kontek\u015bcie spo\u0142eczno-gospodarczym. Aktualnie na tej scenie jest pewnego rodzaju marazm. Wyb\u00f3r jest mizerny. PIS jest bardzo skuteczny bo jest konsekwentny w swoich dzia\u0142aniach, PO to takie rozmyte nie wiadomo co, pope\u0142niaj\u0105ce gafy i ma r\u00f3\u017cne g\u0142upie wpadki, to s\u0105 ludzie oderwanymi od spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa, nie maj\u0105 \u017cadnego sensownego, konkretnego planu czy rozwi\u0105za\u0144. Dlatego jakim\u015b wyj\u015bciem z tej sytuacji, opcj\u0105 wyda\u0142a mi si\u0119 Wiosna i w ostatnich wyborach do parlamentu europejskiego g\u0142osowa\u0142am na Biedronia bo chc\u0119 \u017ceby reprezentowa\u0142 nasze interesy kto\u015b kto jest tolerancyjny, szanuj\u0105cy r\u00f3\u017cne grupy spo\u0142eczne i promuj\u0105cy wolno\u015b\u0107 wybor\u00f3w czyli warto\u015bci, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 mi zdecydowanie bliskie i na, kt\u00f3rych mo\u017cna budowa\u0107 dzia\u0142ania, kt\u00f3re maj\u0105 wi\u0119ksz\u0105 szans\u0119 powodzenia. To te\u017c jest jaki\u015b g\u0142os przeciwko nacjonalizmowi, kt\u00f3ry funduje nam aktualnie PIS. \n\nWiem, \u017ce  program gospodarczy Biedronia jest s\u0142aby ale s\u0105 tam  jakie\u015b w\u0105tki pro biznesowe np. zniesienie kontroli skarbowej w ma\u0142ych przedsi\u0119biorstwach. Jednak dla mnie ta rozgrywka sz\u0142a o co innego; o \u015bwiatopogl\u0105d, o bycie otwartym europejskim pa\u0144stwem, o odtrutk\u0119 na ten nacjonalizm, przeciwstawienie si\u0119 tym, kt\u00f3rzy na ka\u017cdym kroku m\u00f3wi\u0105 nam jak mamy \u017cy\u0107 nawet w kwestiach bardzo intymnych. Zdaj\u0119 sobie spraw\u0119, \u017ce cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 ich postulat\u00f3w jest ma\u0142o realna w naszej rzeczywisto\u015bci (zamkni\u0119cie wszystkich kopal\u0144 do 2035r., czy zawieranie ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144stw jednop\u0142ciowych- cho\u0107 tu niez\u0142ym przyk\u0142adem jest Irlandia- niemo\u017cliwe sta\u0142o si\u0119 mo\u017cliwe \ud83d\ude0a) ale wg. mnie trzeba pr\u00f3bowa\u0107 i pokazywa\u0107 poparcie dla tego rodzaju polityk\u00f3w. \n\nMam te\u017c wra\u017cenie, \u017ce procentowo na tej wolno\u015bci dzia\u0142ania wcale nie zale\u017cy zbyt wielu ludziom. Polski nie by\u0142o na mapie przez 123 lata, potem wiadomo co by\u0142o; socrealizm itd. Ca\u0142y czas byli\u015bmy, \u017ceby to uj\u0105\u0107 w miar\u0119 delikatnie trzymani za \u201etwarz\u201d jako nar\u00f3d i wielu ludziom mimo wszystko dalej to odpowiada. Ci ludzie nie umiej\u0105 lub nie chc\u0105 korzysta\u0107 z tej wolno\u015bci, nie potrafi\u0105 by\u0107 samodzielni, na pewnych rzeczach im nie zale\u017cy, nie rozumiej\u0105 podstawowych praw ekonomii, zasad dzia\u0142ania bud\u017cetu pa\u0144stwa, w gruncie rzeczy nie znaj\u0105 si\u0119 na polityce tylko \u015blepo id\u0105 za tym, kto rzuci jaki\u015b och\u0142ap. Wol\u0105 dostawa\u0107 cokolwiek bez wzgl\u0119du na koszty ekonomiczne ni\u017c si\u0119 zbuntowa\u0107, dzia\u0142a\u0107, my\u015ble\u0107 krytycznie. \n\nMy ca\u0142y czas uczymy si\u0119 tej demokracji, (kt\u00f3ra paradoksalnie jest trudna) samo\u015bwiadomo\u015bci i idzie nam to dosy\u0107 powoli. Szczeg\u00f3lnie, \u017ce promowane i dotowane s\u0105 postawy bierne. Czasami zastanawiam si\u0119 czy mo\u017cna to zmieni\u0107.

I'm a financial analyst, I started working remotely back in 2014 for a American startup, and because I had the flexibility I spent three, four years traveling within India and Southeast Asia which gave me perspective on the coworking as a concept, because I probably visited 50 or 64 coworking spaces over the span of three, four years.\n\nI advised some coworking coliving companies on their expansion, on their strategy, and also the government of Goa on making Goa more popular among digital nomads. All of my experience came together, and I started a coworking coliving place in Goa last year called NomadGao. It's in a village not too far from the beach.\n\nI did a lot of research on what people are looking for, what sort of people travel and live in coliving places, or work from coworking spaces, apart from the the first-hand experience that I have had being the coworker myself. \n\nWe are a small space. We have about 15 to 20 coworking seats, five or six rooms. It's fairly manageable without technology. Our focus has been more on human interaction, but once we ended up having double bookings from different platforms, then we said, \"Okay, technologically is a must,\" even though the scale is small. In fact, the small scale helped us in experimenting with technologies and see what works best.\n\nWe use Cobot for the coworking space management, which makes it easy for our customers to sign up and to pay. For the coliving, we are listed on Airbnb. We also are on our own platform. We use general manager, Cloudbeds, which helps us make sure that double bookings won't happen. The rates and everything goes to different tenants smoothly.\n\nWe use social media extensively because we are a new space. We are developing the digital nomad scene in Goa, we are actually promoting Goa, and then promoting that space. \n\nFor the coworking space management, we've tried two or three different softwares. We could do that because most of our members are in house. We just need a software that takes care of messaging eight to ten people. When something goes wrong, it's much easier to talk to our customers and apologize, and make sure that we break the ice. When I talk about experimentation, I think it's more about making sure that our customers are okay with the new things we are trying. I think that would be much harder to do in bigger spaces.\n\nWe were in lockdown for over two months, which gave us a lot of time for thinking about how we really want the systems to be. For example, we had separate systems for coworking, coliving, and  accounting, so we did a lot of manual work fetching bookings from the booking platform, putting them in that concrete system, or fetching bookings from Cobot and putting them in that concrete system. Now we use Zapier to integrate all these products. \n\nIn COVID, we are focusing more on automating because I feel that humans need not spend their time in things that can be automated easily. People who are working with me and my team should be focusing more on building the community, or focusing on making sure that everybody here is happy, or should focus on connecting people with each other to drive synergies or collaborations.\n\nIn terms of community, I think people are spending longer time here because either they're locked down or didn't want to be in big cities in India, so they came over to Goa and they're working from our space. The biggest change is the demographics. Earlier we had 80% expats, or foreigners, or non-Indian digital nomads. But now that borders are closed and flights are not operating, we have seen that demographic change. A lot of Indian companies going remote, lot of Indian companies opting to give work to freelancers, we'll see a lot of Indians coming here. \n\nCobot takes care of our accounting and allows us to have a public community directory so that people can talk to each other, and then meet. For example, if a new member comes in who needs a designer, and if we have had a designer in the past, it's much easier to connect directly through Cobot member directory. It also gives us some insights about member demographics to focus our marketing efforts, or to focus on overall strategy. It also allows access control, but we haven't done that so far because, again, it's a matter of scale. \n\nI'm quite excited about the future. A lot of Indian companies are approaching us. So far we were focused solely on digital nomads, but now we are getting a lot of artists who want a break from big cities who stay with us. The enterprise part is going to grow because companies will need places for offline retreats, or they will need offices in exotic destinations. \n\nI feel that government should be more in this, because policies matter. For example, when you focus on digital nomads, the visa situation is a gray area where there is no visa for digital nomads. Now Estonia is doing it, or Thailand is doing smart visa, but unless government gets involved, there won't be a legitimacy to digital nomads.\n\nThe government also needs to focus on building the ecosystem. Not just spaces, but then encouraging internet service providers to invest and have better networks at such places, or creating some basic facilities. For example, I consulted Goa government on attracting digital nomads back in 2018. Goa is a great place. We are most welcome to come over here, but, it lacks certain basic things. I think government can help in getting all that basic ecosystem in place.\n\nSome of the Indian governments are acting on this. There is a local government in the state of Kerala that is asking people to convince their employers to give them remote work, and then setting up coworking infrastructure so that people can actually work from places in the state. The government of India has also launched its own work from home program where people will have to work from home for at least 15 days in a year. Some of the public sector organizations are launching their own work from home programs. I think over time we'll see government getting more active into this space, building own coworking spaces for their own employees, or employees of other public sector companies.\n\nThe biggest challenge is using this form of remote work to have a distributed world, a more equal world. We have this very beautiful tool for remote work to make it happen.nIf coworking spaces sprout in tier two, tier three cities or rural areas of India, it would be a great equalizer. I read a interesting piece about a company, a unicorn company, in India, whose founder works from a village. They're building offices, small offices in different villages, so that people who belong to nearby villages can work on there so they don't have to commute or move to a bigger city.  I think technology can play a great role in this. It all starts with having the basic internet infrastructure for all. If it is spread out well, if all the areas, the rural or urban, get the same internet connectivity, it's much easier to make the reverse shift happen. \n\nWe are also working on a social program.The idea is to have volunteers who have remote jobs or remote work who go to villages, spend three months, six months there, spend a couple of hours a day in educating the rural population on using technology. Then also learning sustainable ways of living or farming, to bridge this urban-rural gap. I feel, yeah, the next big challenge is to bridge the gap, and maybe there's, then, equality. Program Panchayat is the first initiative right now. We run skill share programs. We try to integrate the local community into what we are doing. We plan to continue that in different places over the next couple of years.\n\nMost of our members come for a month, they end up being here for three months because they love the space and they love this family. In terms of skill share, actually our community members actively share what they know, share their own skills. We record them, put them on YouTube. We sometimes invite locals to come over for the skill shares. In terms of integration between coworking, coliving, skill share and everything else that we are doing, I think that we are quite integrated. Our community does all of this.\n\nNow we are adding community manager, hopefully in the next month or two, so that we can focus on the social mosaic, or to really take this model and expand. We don't use technology in onboarding, because I feel that what sets us apart is the family feel, the warmth. We walk around, show them around, and give them some tips. Eventually maybe we'll have to automate some of it through technology, but right now it's just manual.\n\nThe best thing that could happen is we build something to make India popular for digital nomads. I've been working towards it for the last four years. I feel the stage is set to make that happen, we just need to be consistent. \n\nSo far coworking in India was just the urban coworking, find which coworking spaces in big cities, but I think that model is going to change now. With population getting this to move there, with a lot of people going at remote work. Coworking would not be just about real estate. It's not a real estate business anymore, because with social distancing and all, all of the economics of coworking have changed. You'll probably have to bring in less the number of people in the space that you ... At least for some amount considering moving by a number of people. I think now it's time to focus on building the human connection rather than building the space. We are trying to do that here.\n\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*Meet Mayur at our event on 21/7.

These trends are very different to what has become normative in the social media age in the liberal democracies which are still, just barely, the majority of the internet.

Big tech monopolies are creating an extremely toxic environment and I feel the urge to counteract. I believe that opening up knowledge is part of the solution we currently need. We need decentralized technologies that empower users to use their data for their own benefits!\nI work at the intersection between tech and civil society as a connector between those worlds. \nI first co-founded a project called [TraceMap](http://www.tracemap.info), where we developed an [open source tool](https://tracemap.info/demo.mp4) that displays maps of how information spreads on Twitter. These maps, together with a bunch of metrics and analytic tools, were specifically designed to help Twitter users and journalists make sense of the news they're reading.\nNow TraceMap is associated to [Worldbrain](https://worldbrain.io/), the creators of Memex. Memex is a privacy-focused, open-source & offline-first browser extension for web-research collaborative organisation. We want to empower independent journalists, content creators, researchers and fact-checkers in all steps necessary for the creation of good-quality information. \nWe are soon starting to develop collaboration features - and, in this process, to involve non-tech actors into the development steps. \nThis brings me to one of my topics of interest for the fellowship: How can we bring the tech community and civil society actors closer together? How can we foster collaboration between these worlds? Different communities speak different languages, use different platforms and have different understandings, a real challenge to be tackled. How can we decrease literacy barriers for people to access certain communities? How can we increase interoperability between platforms? Should we design platforms differently? Do we need more mediators between the different communities?\nThere are broader questions related to democratization of knowledge and linking back to the misinformation problem: How can we decouple knowledge from economic interest? How can we find sustainable models? How to design micropayment systems without falling back into old, toxic models?\nI\u2019m looking forward to meet likeminded people in here, exchange thoughts and collaborate!", "created_at": "2019-05-29 16:40:57.852251", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 16:26:55.353589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 129.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4265, 5115, 5108], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57896, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10533, "post_number": 4, "raw": "and here even more in detail https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-calls-lets-talk-almost-face-to-face/10110", "created_at": "2019-08-13 09:52:05.327810", "updated_at": "2019-08-13 09:52:05.327810", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [57894], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77090, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13595, "post_number": 10, "raw": "I'll pencil it in for Monday at 6pm, if anyone has a clash just let me know.", "created_at": "2020-05-20 16:33:44.160331", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 16:35:04.275538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77089], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26437, "user_id": 1880, "topic_id": 3033, "post_number": 8, "raw": "@Vahagn, hey.

A course series and online teach/connection method is developed in collaboration with Edgeryders, its diverse international community and the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education [OMEP](https://www.omepitalia.org/). It uses technology to empower creativity and transfer skills and knowledge for online teaching, the articulation and communication of culture and distributed collaboration. The course series consists of three one-week courses:*\n\n*Each course will teach the participants how to draw analogue sketches and paintings which can be transformed into VR environments in connection to a topical conversation and co-creative learning. We address 3 interconnected key-groups and topics which are especially relevant during the current crisis directly:*\n\n*1. ViConnect Learning (first week, 10 - 20 participants )*: Addresses educators and parents. We discuss the challenge of making virtual classrooms effective and using creativity and virtual reality to make digital teaching more engaging and ask the participants to use the experiences to design their \u201cdream virtual classroom\u201d to discuss further.\n\n*2. ViConnect Culture & Play (second week, 5-10 Families)*: Addresses children and parents to make virtual reality accessible to children and give them a creative outlet in times of quarantine and curfew and method of sharing their ideas and culture and to create awareness of the diversity of culture in Europe. Via a playful story we discuss and share culture and current situations: Children are asked to create VR-drawings to explain their home to a fictional character visiting Europe for the first time and are not allowed to travel due to lockdown.\n\n*3. ViConnect Work (third week, 10 - 20 participants)*: Addresses distributed/home office workers. We will discuss challenges and solutions for distributed work informed by the large distributed collaboration manual already developed by Edgeryders. The participants will be asked to use the VR-drawing technique to sketch their \u201cdream home office\u201d; the conversation will inform the ongoing development of another distributed collaboration MOOC by Edgeryders.\n\nWe want to invite you to the ViConnect Play & Culture Prototype Event.\n\n```\n{ \"info\": \"This is the next step in the development of a webinar series using analogue drawing and VR technology to give you and your children a creative outlet and way to connect during the lockdown as well as a forum for a meaningful and creative borderless conversation.

We also discussed the go to market strategy and the important events and deadlines to lunch the app as well as the strategy that will be used online and offline to attract the first customers and the pricing strategy as well.*\n\n*We discussed the next actions that will be undertaken and we agreed that Slaheddine will update the action plan taking into account the progress made so far.*\n\n**Meeting 2:** @MohsenMahdaoui , Tunisia,PaillEco\n\n*We started the meeting by discussing the outcomes of the customer discovery.*\n\n*Mohsen told me that the interviews conducted helped him to test some assumptions and to identify the right customer segments, i.e. ecological guest houses.*\n\n*We reviewed the action plan and we discussed the degree of progress made with regard to what was planned and scheduled.*\n\n*Overall Mohasen has done a satisfactory progress however the action plan should be updated to include some key actions as customer discovery, patent filing and marketing strategy. The deadlines should also be reviewed and update accordingly.*\n\n*Mohsen has already got the raw material needed to build the prototype and contacted some laboratories and companies to help him developing the first version of the prototype.*\n\n*We discussed some challenges that Mohsen is facing as the money needed to rent a laboratory 15 days to work on the prototype and to hire an expert to help him with it.  *\n\n*We agreed that the prototype should be ready by the end of April and we discussed the go to market strategy. The team needs to be widened to include a REP since all current team members have tech oriented profiles.*\n\n**Meeting 3:** @HIBA Diyafa - Morocco\n\n*We started the meeting discussing the progress made so far. The good thing is that Hiba has already started delivering her service (using a concierge MVP) even though the online app/ website is not developed yet. She organized 9 trips with groups between 25 and 7 people.*\n\n*We reviewed the action plan and we discussed the degree of progress made with regard to what was planned and scheduled. Since all the actions are scheduled to start at earliest in second half of March, we discussed the progress made so far with the customer discovery and customer interviews. I gave Hiba some feedback and advice about the way she should interview the customers and we agreed that she will review the questions following my recommendations and that she will prepare interview questions for the B2B segment.*\n\n*We have also discussed the financial side of the action plan. I discussed with Hiba my concerns about the fact that some actions are over estimated (such as the logo creation and the mission statement preparation) while other aspect such as the digital marketing campaigns and customer acquisition are under estimated. I advised her to review the estimates and to look for contributors that would propose fair quotes.*\n\n*We agree that Hiba will update her action plan accordingly and that we will meet the next week by Thursday 19 March 2020.*\n\n \n\n**Meeting 4:** @ayari.taha , Tunisia, Artificial intelligence for alzheimer\u2019s and dementia predicition\n\n*We started the meeting discussing the challenges faced currently by Taha with regard to access to data and the target market. Since it\u2019s a new product in a very specific market, it\u2019s normal to face resistance to change and reluctant stakeholders. Based on my experience, I gave Taha some advice to overcome those challenges.*\n\n*We reviewed the progress made with regard to the action plan and the prototype development and overall Taha made a good progress. We discussed the outcomes of the customer discovery and how they can be used to develop a prototype.*\n\n*We reviewed the actions and many development actions have been done. Some other actions are delayed due to some constraints that Taha faced. In this respect, we agreed that Taha will review the dates and update them accordingly. Also, I advised him to start thinking about his Go to market strategy and the marketing side in order to include them in the action plan.*", "created_at": "2020-03-12 19:40:01.067800", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:25:16.892786", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 854, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 78.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6116, 5860, 5547, 6119], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57043, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10367, "post_number": 9, "raw": "The call is happening here: https://zoom.us/j/482525755", "created_at": "2019-07-23 14:20:43.001058", "updated_at": "2019-07-23 14:20:43.001058", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9768, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2335, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Coordination Costs?</b>\n\nWhat is the 8000 spent on 'Coordination Costs' used for?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-17 07:21:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:56.560228", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59136, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10726, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Mmh yes, paid collaborators are nice help indeed to finish and publish any sub-part of the EarthOS document.

.\n[/text-direction]\n\n------\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bbeing a plant (Farm Dream) is based on self-sufficiency in production and under arid conditions and the use of all the surrounding resources from microorganisms and even human resources and solid or organic resources and harnessing each of these resources for the success of the project Farm) and the first element exploited in the establishment of the project is clean and renewable energy\n\n**The project is based on the following elements**\n\n* Cultivation of vegetable plants, medicinal and aromatic plants, without soil. Protected agriculture (agricultural)\n* Feeding units for calves, sheep and poultry.\n* Production unit of wheat barley with a capacity of half a ton per day.\n* Cultivation of dcoid moss.\n* Production of domestic fly larvae for the production of animal feed and compost production\n* Solar water desalination units in the absence of fresh water for aquaculture.\n\n**Cultivation of plants and the causes of agriculture without soil**\n\nIs an ideal solution for water scarcity and provides nearly 85% of the water used in conventional agriculture\n\nA clean health product where there is strong control in the fertilizer processes, which prevents the sediment from the nutrients\n\nEnvironmentally friendly in order to preserve the raw stock of water from pollution\n\nNon-use of soil pesticides For the vegetable total, pesticides are used from plant natural resources.\n\nSaving time for crop life, which increases the production cycles and thus increase the quantities produced. For example, the lettuce crop needs 40 days in soilless farming technique, but the same crop type needs 68 days in traditional agriculture.\n\nThe loss of the loss is very large and almost rare.\n\nCrops can be produced throughout the year and with the same marketing efficiency.\n\nA solution to the lack of suitable arable land such as desert, salty or disease-ridden lands.\n\nThe unit size can be increased by vertical cultivation.\n\n**Cultivation of barley (green feed)**\n\n_**Economic, social and health importance of barley cultivation**_\n\n* Easy to produce throughout the year in all seasons.\n* Provide a working hand in charge where this system requires only two workers at most.\n* Providing water consumption where it is necessary to produce one ton per day of green barley from 350 to 400 liters of water per day.\n* Providing the land instead of cultivating feed for animals and using the land in the cultivation of economic crops where the system requires only a room of 50 square meters to produce tons of green feed per day.\n* Provide the price of fertilizer for not using them in this system.\n* Easy to digest and therefore does not cause swelling or poor digestion in the animal and reach the digestion rate to 95%.\n* Organic product free of chemicals, hormones and fertilizers.\n* Free of hydrosyanide, which appears in clover with age 45 days, which causes weak immunity and lack of food conversion in the animal.\n* And the percentage of digested protein to 85%.\n* And helps to increase milk damage in the milk to 25%.\n* And very palatable to all animals and have a large turnout.\n\n**Cultivation of dcoid moss**\n\nDecoid is used to feed fish and contains 45% protein content.\n\nProduction of acreage of dcoude per tonne per day.\n\nThe profit of the feddan is 100 thousand pounds annually\n\nFeeding fish with dicode reduces the price of fish ton 3000 pounds.\n\nAnd that the economic feasibility in favor of dcouide, while the price of tons of regular feed for fish is 4000 pounds, the price of tons of dcoude does not exceed 500 pounds, and therefore the cost of fish ton of 5000 pounds using dcoid, while the cost of regular feed 8000 pounds, The project should contribute to reducing meat prices, providing feed imports, and increasing farm incomes.\n\nThe growth of the crop takes only one month, after which every day a green tonne is harvested. The dcode can be served green or dry, and the feddan needs one worker per day, so the cost is low. Decoid is the fastest growing organism on the face of the earth, because it doubles its weight every day, producing at least 1 ton per day\n\n**Production of domestic fly larvae as animal protein feed**\n\nThe domestic fly larvae can be produced and used as animal protein feed. This saves us much of the burden and financial cost of producing animal protein feed.\n\nThese larvae are produced within four days of the laying of eggs from the adult insect. This is done after the work of our organic household waste and after the larvae feed on the carcasses and turn them into compost suitable for agriculture. We found a crop of larvae with hundreds of thousands and fed Including fish and poultry and enter into all types of animal feed.\n\n**Solar Water Desalination Units**\n\nIt is based on the collection of the sun at one point. The focus is on a metal pipe, which passes through the water to be heated or ammo, and the condensation of the evaporated water is collected and collected in a vessel or basin and water is used in the culture.", "created_at": "2017-08-28 17:58:58.508708", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 14:04:56.698299", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1581, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 504.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34968], "is_liked_by": [3826, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78522, "user_id": 5209, "topic_id": 13822, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, \n\nI came across this very relevant report by the folks at simply secure, which surveys the challenges of doing decentralised design + some recommendations based on qualitative research with practitioners. \n\nWould love to hear if the approach and findings resonate with all the geeki decentralization affinados on this platform!

You seem like a really interesting man.\u00a0\n\nWhat strikes me in this report is the intuition that there is a lot of skill, a lot of talent on housing estates. Somehow, it does not seem to find an outlet: but if it did it would completely change for the better life on the estates. This resonates with me, because I do online communities: and every time I do one I am awestruck by the sheer amount of talent, wisdom, sheer energy and crazy stories out there. Just looking at Edgeryders is... well, quite amazing. Young people are supposed to be a problem category, but they actually display more initiative than the people who are supposed to help them!\n\nSo I have no trouble believing that people leaving in the Tottenham estates have it in them to save themselves from an unsatisfactory life. This is a great intuition, that could turn regeneration policy on its head. You dont' regenerate by persuading Tesco to build another hypermarket in the area, you regenerate by enabling the local people to do what yhey are good at doing.\n\nHowever, I am not convinced by your analysis when you say the problem is, people don't have enough money and are trying to scrap more of it all the time. As far as I can see \"people don't have enough money\" is not an explanation, it's a description. The question is\u00a0<em>why</em>\u00a0don't they have enough money? Where are the bottlenecks that prevent them from using their skills for making a living, and how can they be removed?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 21:25:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.270730", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 298, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63068, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10810, "post_number": 40, "raw": "I added the Events page in FR:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/thereef-brussels-events/11171\n\nI see that the Frontpage is also done.

For example could I link to a page of tasks exclusively focused on web development?\"\n\nTasks can be filtered / clustered by Project (= group), type, priority and status. The applicable values for that ware on the <a href=\"/casetracker\">task manager page</a>. For building the link you need some Firebug magic to find out the URL parameter names, as in the task manager itself they stay invisible (meaning, it uses POST parameters). For example, when I wanted to list all tasks in the Making Lote 3 group that are of type \"General Task\", I could use this link: <a href=\"/casetracker?pid=568&amp;case_type_id%5B%5D=11\">/casetracker?pid=568&amp;case_type_id[]=11</a>. If that kind of clustering is sufficient for you, fine (we can adapt the \"task types\", but it should be generic, because it applies to the whole site).\n\nIf you want freeform clustering by any tag you choose, the way to go would be filling the \"Topics\" field in the task edit form. Problem is, I don't think that linking to a page filtered by tag <em>and</em> node type (like \"only tasks\") is possible yet, and somebody would have to look into this for getting it done. If you want that feature, just open a task in the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331\">Edgeryders Dev &amp; Testing</a> group.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-17 20:25:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.592774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 258, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24110], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72461, "user_id": 6331, "topic_id": 12947, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thank you both.\n\nToday was last minute run arounds.

Now that we are stuck at home we even started baking stuff...* :man_facepalming: \n\n\n---\n\n\"What are you doing in life?\"\n---\n\nI try to contribute to my family by choosing problems and attempting to solve them. I guess for some that'd make me an **entrepreneur**. Most recently I've been involved with **map-making and open GIS**. By training I am an engineer (studied automation, robotics and AI), by vocation, I feel, I've always been a **traveller**. I was born in Italy and have lived in four different countries since 2007. Current home is Yerevan, Armenia. I've been here a while. \n\nI got interested in making maps sometime in 2016. I've always liked them, as a young child one of my favourite pastimes was daydreaming over atlases (I still do that) and copying maps on semi-transparent paper, colouring them up with pencils and pens. I now like to think of that as travelling before I actually could.\n\nFast forward to now, through the luck of meeting a like-minded partner, [Cartisan](https://cartisan.org/) was formed, and our first *public result* was a [successful crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/maps-for-hikers-dilijan-national-park-armenia#/), in November 2018, to put out into the world our first product, which also happened to be **the very first modern topo map of Armenia since Soviet times**. It was a lot of work, and also so rewarding! And we haven't stopped since, we kept providing GIS services to (mostly) trail-building organisations in Armenia, and making new products for hikers, maps and now working on guides too, along the way.\n\nOur products and services became my source of livelihood, or rather, my contribution towards it, as it is frankly not enough to support my and my co-founder's families yet. But we were slowly, steadily, growing towards that, before the pandemic hit...\n\n\n\"What worries you the most about your situation now?\"\n---\n\n**These are quite stressful times, but I consider myself lucky, relatively speaking**. Our work has always been remote (my co-founder lives in Germany) so we could simply carry on, Personally speaking, I've gone through radical shifts in both my professional and personal life before, quite a few times. Some were positively driven, other ones not so much. In any event, I don't know if it was intentional or just thanks to my curiosity, but ***change* and *re-invention* are becoming somewhat normal**, like turning the pages of a book, that's simply how I kept moving from one *chapter* to the next.\n\nThat, I believe, will become more and more relevant in the future. Whether we like it or not.\n\nI also understand that previous experience will not make changes any less painful to live through, but having had some practice with them, and having seen *the other side* of that pain a few times, at least *I know* there is hope.\n\nCombine all that with the fact that my wife still has a salary, for now at least, and that some of our backlog projects will *probably* still get funded at some point, and you'd be right to ask: *so what are you so worried about, exactly?*\n\nWell, yes, things are not as bad as they could be. We are not going to sell many maps this year, but we can still make the new products for 2021, while personally still having a way to put food on the table. **I am very grateful for that**.\n\nAnd yet, anxiety mounts. because as I said elsewhere, I have this feeling the world is just **not going back to *business as usual***, which could be a good thing in the end; I think **this global transition, and it's economic fallout, are going to last longer than we think, and we are going to struggle**. I really hope I'm wrong here.\n\nAnd I get anxious because I don't quite know what to do with *that*, how to deal with it. It's going to take a toll on our collective mental health, myself included, it's going to be exhausting at best to keep up with it. I so hope I am overestimating this...\n\n\n\"What makes you hopeful about the future?\"\n---\n\nThe vast amount of time I used to have for free thinking and experimentation has shrunk significantly with a growing family, so risks are *more risky* now. That could, in theory, make me more focused and persistent, but I am not so sure about that yet. I hope it will.\n\nI am also hopeful because this global crisis is exposing, *yet again*, how the global economical and political systems are not really serving the majority of people *all that well* (I am aware of my privileged position). In this I hope for a collective chance to stir changes towards a more ...\"healthy direction\". One must hope we won't botch it again! *\n\nI have no recipes for how to do so though. I perhaps just don't know enough to be sure of what I personally think either, so I am implicitly hoping for some guidance here, mentoring even, that could help direct our tiny efforts to *a right-ish target*, so to speak.\n\nFinally, I think most of us are going to publicly grow our appreciation for community, at various scales, and towards the people that serve such communities too. Again, I really hope this lesson could be widely learned, and deeply rooted. Enough for societal rewards to be adjusted accordingly. If it sounds naive, it's because I am a little, most \"entrepreneurs\" are, or we'll never even try to do what we do. \n\n</br></br>\n\n\n\\* even if...\n >\u201cHuman beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.\u201d - Douglas Adams.\n\n:cry:\n</br></br></br>\n\n---\n</br></br>\n\nThe rapid fire questions now\n---\n\n- *a lesson that life is teaching you:* I should have acted more decisively while we had time, and build our semi-off-grid dream house in the countryside already, with a lovely community to share the space. We'd be better prepared now to ride this storm, and in a much happier state by now. I knew something was coming, I just thought we had more time... :sweat_smile:\n- *a book recommendation*: [The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603498-the-divide) - by Jason Hickel. I haven't finished it yet, so I didn't get to those solutions, but it's definitely being illuminating when it comes to understanding how the structural inequality works, and how that made our society much less resilient to situations like the one we are currently living in 2020; it also shone a light to who's been benefiting from those choices the most. I somehow feel this is the book one should read after also reading [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel) by Jared Diamond, and/or [Factfulness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness) by Hans Rosling, to have a more complete and sobering view.

E o initiativa pilot si nu apartine niciunei organizatii. Suntem un grup informal si oricine poate da o mana de ajutor.

E important sa fie langa incinte private ca sa evitam probleme legate de autorizatii legale.\n\n* ar trebuie sa fie un super frigider comunitar - ideal o vitrina uriasa in care mancarea sa se vada, sa arate ingrijit, si care ar fi mai greu de vandalizat. poate il facem pe roti, sau poate ii construim un fel de dulap in care sa stea, cu etajere in plus unde sa se poata amplasa materiale despre food waste si contactele celor implicati in caz ca oamenii vor sa se ofere voluntari. deocamdata am facut rost doar de 3 frigidere normale, nu vitrine \n\n* frigiderul e un loc liber, al comunitatii, si de socializare. ar trebui sa fie preluat de comunitatea unde e amplasat si oamenii sa se organizeze sa verifice zilnic ce intra in frigider si sa arunce eventualele produse stricate \n\n* pe langa schimbul de mancare, se mai pot organiza in comunitate cine pop up, cursuri de gatit. Uite cum fac cei de la Carusel cu Care Cafe: https://www.facebook.com/marian.ursan1/posts/10205184202823154\n\n* frigiderul ar fi responsabilitatea unei comunitati, nu a noastra, noi incepem dupa care recrutam oamenii de pe strada/cartierul x sa il ingrijeasca si aprovizioneze ca pe un bun public, iar noi ne mutam si incepem o noua iteratie in alta zona a orasului. ceva ca o miscare, nu ca un proiect care depinde de echipa initiala. \n\n###Parteneriate\n\nCateva propuneri care s-au facut, dar multe sunt doar in faza de idei: cu Carousel, Visini Hub, Atelier Adhoc (Bucuresti), Food not Bombs, Piata Autonoma Cluj, [Adi Hadean](https://www.adihadean.ro/2016/01/food-waste-romania/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AdiHadean+%28Adi+H\u0103dean%29), Food Waste Combat (Cluj)\n\n###Timeline orientativ - pentru cine vrea sa se implice\n\n* in ianuarie 6-10 ne intalnim in Cluj si Bucuresti sa ne organizam si sa gandim impreuna designul (branding or no branding?), amplasarea, mesajele de comunicare, cum luam legatura cu oamenii din cartierul sau zona unde va fi frigiderul. \n\n* 10 ianuarie - 10 februarie: munca de planificare concreta si deplasat la fata locului pentru a vorbi cu oameni si organizatii interesate sa participe \n\n* 10 februarie: prima zi de aprovizionare \n\n* 10 februarie - 30 martie: un numar de oameni voluntari fac prin rotatie cateva actiuni minime: verificarea si inventarierea produselor, activitati de informare si constientizare etc\n\nCine vine la primele intalniri? ping @Ruxandra @predoiu_alexandru @bogdan_alto Alto (Buc) @Andra_B (Cluj) si restul oamenilor care pareau interesati cand am mai vorbit. \n\n<em>Frigider folosit cumparat aproape pe gratis in Cj.

We tried to order all comments by date in Discourse at first, but that became unreadable as the reader has to jump back and forth a lot. This is not the case in threaded topics where a flow of reading is preserved, but also not in topics naturally created in Discourse, as people care to establish context because they are aware that they are posting at the very bottom.\n\nSo when importing, we ordered comments in the visual order they appeared in Drupal, but without the visual indentations for threading. Preserving the \"what is a reply to what\" relationships, of course.\n\nThat last step is however what did not work in the topic you found. For whatever reason, the \"what comment answers to what comment\" relations are completely messed up when comparing to [the original node in Drupal 7](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/817).\n\nI looked into this issue for a bit, and it seems to affect only the earliest posts from the Drupal 6 platform. The effect is most often a completely flat thread in Discourse (all reply-to information omitted), and sometimes in addition parts of the thread are messed up thread (wrong reply-to information given). Looks like an offset issue (reply-to information from the wrong topic is used).\n\nInitial findings re. the amount of topics affected:\n\n* :x: node [817](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/817) / topic [1245](/t/id/1245): affected (the one you found)\n* :x: node [818](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/818) / topic [1246](/t/id/1246): affected\n* :x: node [820](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/820) / topic [1248](/t/id/1248): affected\n* :x: node [1111](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1111) / topic [1529](/t/id/1529): affected\n* :x: node [1150](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1150) / topic [1750](/t/id/1750): affected\n* :x: node [1245](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1150) / topic [1750](/t/id/1748): affected\n* :heavy_check_mark: node [1246](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1246) / topic [1651](/t/id/1651): not affected\n* :x: node [1249](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1249) / topic [1654](/t/id/1654): affected\n* :x: node [1300](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1300) / topic [1704](/t/id/1704): affected\n* :heavy_check_mark: node [1340](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1340) / topic [1740](/t/id/1740): not affected\n(the post with the highest Drupal 6 `legacy_nid`, namely 1330, means the last automatically imported Drupal 6 node; if nothing is affected after this point, the issue originated from the Drupal 6 \u2192 Drupal 7 import; some other content such as node [1341](https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/node/1341) that was imported manually and will not be affected then)\n* :heavy_check_mark: node [1346](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1346) / topic [1764](/t/id/1764): not affected\n(this \"not affected\" one indicates that the import from Drupal 6 is probably indeed the fault)\n* :heavy_check_mark: node [1400](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1400) / topic [1805](/t/id/1805): not affected\n* :heavy_check_mark: node [1500](http://legacy.edgeryders.eu/node/1500) / topic [1884](/t/id/1884): not affected\n* :heavy_check_mark: later nodes: probably not affected\n\nAssuming the problem is indeed with the old Drupal 6 \u2192 Drupal 7 import, then to fix this we have to go through all Drupal 7 nodes with nid < 1340, check if the problem is happening, and fix it by deriving and adding the proper reply-to information.\n\nAll content has been imported and its relative order shown in Discourse seems fine, too, however the \"who replied to whom\" information may be wrong.

The US, Canada and Japan have observer status in the CoE. The CoE is a much smaller organization than the European Commission (2K employees against 40K).\u00a0\n\nThe CoE is the product of a diplomatic convention among European states concerning human rights and democracy. Its core business is to be the warden of several human rights charters: the most important one is the European Charter of Human Rights, but there are many others protecting certain categories of people (eg. children) or establishing standards over certain issues (eg. minority and regional languages). The CoE writes and updates these charters; gets the member states to sign new ones and new versions of existing ones; and it runs a tribunal, the European Court of Human Rights, that citizens of these states can appeal to if they feel their rights have been violated by a state. Quite likely Julian Assange will show up in Strasbourg at some point!\n\nThis activity feeds on research work.

The paper had advertising and subscriptions both, but TV had only ads.  So our orientation for sales was determined by the TV model. We were among the first sites to sell ads...which was also the way that everyone online else did, because in those days just getting onto the web was enough of an expense and hassle for people that the public was not willing to pay for anything.  No competing with free.  (Also the overall ad revenue was low because at the time Yahoo and later Google were able to sell their ads for a fraction of the price because they had gigantic volume.)\n\nSo then MP3s come along and the public reacts, whoops, nope, not paying for that either, and look I can get tons of music just like that!  One of my closest friends is the guitarist and founder of the punk band The Dead Kennedys and he says his income was cut in half by piracy.  And still to this day with piracy sites able to sell ads to keep operating. Other artists seem to have lost almost all their income and as we all know the only remedy is touring nonstop. Even my friend East Bay Ray tours pretty constantly and he is over 70.  And now, no touring.  I also have close friends who are in a popular band and once they became mothers, their income dropped or else tour with your kid(s). So yeah piracy is a real problem.\n\nBut the laws in response get pretty heavy-handed.  Copyright law is a very blunt instrument so that a lot of what in the USA at least was always considered \"fair use\" is not so easy to get or use now, without risk.  One place this shows up is if you want to make a film.  Any brand you show in your film has to grant permission or you violate copyright.  That kind of stuff shows what a blunt instrument it is.  And my understanding of European copyright law is that there is no fair use regardless.  Do you know if this is the case?\n\nSo then in other areas of tech law, in order to protect society, how broad do you make the brush?  How blunt the instrument?  How much overreach?  Or is it not enough?  With speech it is particularly tricky.  It gets messed up with Facebook especially because they want us to think we are in control of our experience when they are the ones controlling it with some modification tools allowed, but nothing really fundamental.  And they make money our of controversy, division, strife, and polarization. Anxiety is good for advertising.  So they allow all kinds of horrendous things to get said or shown until enough complain or enough pressure gets put and then they become a censor, wither by changing once again their rules and policies, or just ad hoc doing it.  But what they don't do is give us more control because that hurts their business model.  If I were a lawmaker having to deal with that, I am not sure what Solomon-like solution I could come up with.  Banning \"hate speech\" is really a minefield.  And where do you stop?  I don't need a censor. I can decide for myself what is and isn't acceptable.  My kids are grown, but I could decide those things for them too.  Harder now of course with every kid having their own net-connected phone..And sending it to be determined by local community standards of course brings up the borderless nature of the Net.  Some locations now are trying to get their local standard to force overall policy of an otherwise international offering to change.  With increased populism and even racism governing a lot of regional policy, I don't think that is a good idea.  Better user tools - but again, no idea how to enforce that.\n\nInternet usage crossed the tipping point long ago. Not every human is on it, but most are, in one way or another, and the ratio grows all the time.  Ad hoc rules and policies seem to create a double standard as soon as they get issued. The written laws get so broad the collateral damage that comes from them might not be as big as the original problem, but often is still large and has to be addressed - and in some cases makes a bigger problem.  I'm thinking of California's new \"gig worker law\" that forces many more contract workers to become employees.  It was created to help Uber and Lyft drivers, but the law is so broad in includes freelance writers who now have serious disruption to their work routines and many have lost their contracts completely.  The state is going to have to amend that law because it looks like it hurts more people than it helps.\n\nAnyway, a few reflections on the legal framework around technologies.

We should study it, and use it to make better decision.\n[/quote]\nI am deeply interested in this, as it is also part of my studies, and recently I was looking into \"opensource cities\" where it is very fuzzy and no clear definition on what it is or should be. \n\nI like the way you articulated the \"meta city\" and that [quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:8135\"]\nWe are a kind of meta-city.\n[/quote]\nand having this meta level from the weak social ties transcending the physical barriers of the definition of the city ( in which it can be redefined ).\n\nacknowledging the fact that this weak ties happens in other online mediums like Facebook as well, even if it is full of cute cates, babies and celebrities, it is not limited to online communities like edgeryders where you can find high quality discussions. \n\nso let's call this online layer  interest- based communities or something as in the online community that shares your interest(s) and where one can find support and sharing of knowledge. This is definitely needed in both strategies ( rural and urban ) would be much more advanced if there is an alternative economy happening as well as in pay-coupons or any other system of exchange. \n\nAs for the \"rural\" or remote setting one way to go is to have a kind of lab specially for offgrid technologies,and self-sufficiency; a place to apply and test opensource solutions for a certain amount of time. This could make a connection between the urban and rural settlements. \n\nI still need some time to find a good articulation for what the openvillage could be ( meta city is a good start ) as it is not an intentional community nor an incubator or only an online community.\nBy the end of April, I will be attending a seminar on \"smart cities\" in TU Berlin, would like to see where are they in the academic urban field now and introduce as well the openvillage and see possibilities of making some sort of \"lab\" where students can apply their projects and join a community as well ( still need to clear things up but would love to chat with you @alberto on this before going ) \n\n@amelia that's a very nice reading list, a shared folder on zotero would be nice :D \n\nmeanwhile, wanted to share this quote from Townsend's book [SMART CITIES: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/smart_cities_big_data_civic_hackers_and_the_quest_for_a_new_utopia)   which I guess describes what we are doing somehow if you discard the term \"smart city\" or had a broad def of what it is\n>but are civic hackers up to the task of bringing a bottom-up vision of the smart city into existance? Can we evolve the smart city organically - one app, on check in, one API call, One Arduino, one hotspot at a time ?

Before the Internet, valuable information about industrial sectors took time and resources to be gathered and organised. Large companies could do this in-house. Small ones would turn to specialized companies that would produce detailed reports (for example: the beer sector in France) and sell the paper copies. As books went, these were really expensive: but to a small company, the cost of accessing that intelligence was a bargain compared to that of maintaining its own researchers in-house. With data it's the same thing. Plenty of people and orgs out there that you can ask questions, and they will crunch the data for you at a reasonable price, as long as the data are open. \u00a0\n\nIn my opinion, where small entities are facing a disadvantage is in taking advantage of the data they themselves produce. We all generate data, but only a few very large corporates gain from them. This is difficult to fix, because the value of one data point depends on the size of the datasets: knowing, say, the graph of my personal social network is pretty pointless, but knowing the graph of the social network of millions of people is extremely valuable. So we are stuck between a rock and a hard place: if we all give away our data, Google and its peers are the only entities that benefit from them, and that's unfair. But if we each hold on to our data, with no interoperability, the benefit is simply not there, and that's inefficient.\n\nA similar reasoning was behind <a href=\"/u/commonfutures\">@CommonFutures</a>'s vision of \"data coops\" (<a href=\"/t/our-data-coop-intelligent-sharing-for-community-benefit/3768\">here</a>). The idea is to have people involved in \"for benefit\" activities pool their data, and give the pool a legal status such that it can be processed by certain people (the data coop itself and its trusted partners) and not others (marketeers), for certain goals (the common good) and not others (commercial). Not sure where Annemarie is with that, and if she has any care-related examples to share.

Great to see you here @howard_rheingold ! @johncoate mentioned an uptick in interaction at The Well. Is Brainstorms still around Howard? Do you see an uptick there too (I haven't been in Brainstorms in ages).\n\nTwo observations I made in the past few weeks that touch upon this conversation. \n\n1) Yes there is a long list of unconnected initiatives out there currently. Looking at a range of them here in the Netherlands, while some seem to have some substance, many others seem more a coping strategy that keeps one busy but has no impact or meaning on the originator's scope of action or anyone else's agency. Kind of like the way I keep a spreadsheet with case numbers in NL, providing a sense of control or something, but then announcing it to the world as yet another Covid dashboard for coders and designers to contribute to.\nAt the same time initiatives that might have a real impact are invisible and never mentioned online unless they become visible once creating such impact.  (e.g. my brother in law's 3d printer company has approached all businesses and factories that use their printers to donate printing capacity, creating a global networked printing facility, and now discussing with manufacturers (like Phillips) and health ministries how to deploy that network to print respirator parts and masks where needed. It won't be publicly announced as a bottom-up initiative, and it may not be publicly mentioned at all ever.) How do we filter wheat and chaff on a list of initiatives, or do we have a role in guiding others to potentially more meaningful activities and away from the coping projects like my spreadsheet/ other's shiny dashboards?\n\n2) On working from home en masse. Most of my work is with government entities. A common tactic for people is to wait with doing something and ignore emails etc until the requester shows up at your desk asking about it . That escalation path is no longer available, showing up at one's desk. As a result I see some civil servants withdraw on an island of clearly defined tasks, simply not responding to mails,calls etc about any other topic.  A withdrawal.

Finding your people across shared interests. Getting outlines of what you might be able to do together. Identifying hidden talent that is just right for solving your challenge. Identifying possible strategic alliances. \n\n\nRight now you have four options, each of which is not really fit for the task\n\n1. Events (little to no support to find the right people who you should meet during the event)\n2. Linked in: advanced phone book and bragging/self promotion space\n3. FB/ Twitter: adhd - no memory\n4. Coworking spaces - they promise to connect you to good opportunities but the pool of members who frequent any physical space is generally too small to close the circle of needs and offers. Many don't run 24/7 either. \n\nEdgeryders stack of virtual coworking and distributed collaboration technologies make it easy to build and shows new connections people make between topics. As well as which people seem to resonate/cluster around the different connections being made. Once you know how to connect people in meaningful ways, it makes it possible and easy to catheard people towards developing new business or research ideas. Cocreate pitches or prototypes. Build new strategic collaborations. Or help you find the right pool of talent for your challenge. What we offer:\n\n\n* New digital  tools for better online and offline events\n* Support upgrade your organisation's distributed/remote work\n* Next generation technologies for virtual collaboration\n* Joint projects and programs\n\n<hr>\n\n## Our Services\n<hr>\n\n### Readiness Audit\n\n* Interviews\n* Recommendations\n* Change Management Program\n\n### Distributed Collaboration Training, 8 day program\n\n* Mooc\n* Manual\n* Learning community (outreach activities & management)\n\n### White label installation\n\n* Platform\n* Webkit\n* Data analysis modules: [Sensestack.edgeryders.eu](http://sensestack.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n### Platform activation & animation services\n\n* Engagement engine design\n* Community management\n* Content Management\n\n### 2.5 Day Training Program, Remote\n\n* White label Installation: Basic - Discourse + 1 Standard Webkit site\n* Orientation: 1/2 Day\n* Discourse training: Wizards type format - Simple, Advanced\n* Community mgt: Will also learn ow to use & modify the platform, Academy courses\n* Add ons: Community Mgt & Data analysis Dashboard, Data analysis training (Graphryder, Open Ethnographer Academy courses).\n\n\n<hr>\n\n## Tools we offer\n<hr>\n\n\n* Webkit: Online platform + modules\n* Remote Learning Materials - Mooc + audits + coaching\n* Reports from experiments and events\n\n## Webkit \nA stack of technologies that talk to the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) and to each other to enable us to*  :\n\n* Produce minisites on the fly for edgeryders projects:\n  1. The minisite content (but not the structure) must be editable from inside Discourse  ***or***  both content and structure must be editable an deployable from the webkit GUI, using a Discourse account. The second option would however mean that a full markdown editor with live preview etc. would have to be added to the webkit, which is why I am rather against that. Let\u2019s keep it simple, and close to Discourse, so that it can be published as a \u201csite builder for Discourse\u201d eventually.\n  2. There should be a few modules that take in YAML content (as a link to a Discourse post that contains a YAML code section) and display it in a visually enhanced way. This is needed to publish sections of the minisite in a way beyond what Markdown inside a Discourse editor is capable of. An example for that technique is [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/11088/2).\n* Improve success of onboarding people towards the edgeryders site\n* Standardise our distributed event production methodology\n* Build an effective alternative to social media communication campaigns for outreach efforts\n* Decentralise key community onboarding and activation tasks away from community managers to volunteers (welcome committee).\nImprove visibility and communication of research findings\n\n\n### Online Platform\n **A dynamic online space for  learning, networking, coordination and business development** \n\nSome of our clients and parts prefer to nest their online collaboration spaces within the platforms maintained by the Edgeryders organisation. Either because they don't have in house tech support, or because they want to draw the benefits of being plugged into our friendly and supportive global community. We don't charge anything for this, but do require everyone to agree to basic rules of conduct and respect the social contract which keeps our space healthy and generative for everyone concerned. \nFeatures of our online collaboration platform solution:\n\n  * Email slayer: Used correctly this platform will kill need for email based communication. Edgeryders is an email-free organisation thanks to this technology and  easy to follow protocols for using it.\n \n  * No more document version headaches: Any static document can be transformed into a dynamic, collaboratively editable one. \n\n  * HR can use this to lower cost and time spent on recruiting and training new members.\n  * Project teams can quickly generate interactive reports with links to key documents on the fly\n  * Project teams or event organisers can generate interactive and dynamic websites for the events where curated content from conversations before and after are displayed.\n  * For Communication campaigns, it becomes a way to crowd-source reporting and outreach efforts among its members.\n* Open Ethnographer add-on: Allows you to annotate content on your platform and create ethnographies of your conversation. Good for: low cost high quality and always up to date knowledgement management.\n* Graphryder add-on: Allows you to see SSN graphs of your conversation and an ethnography of your distributed business cluster. Good for:  Finding the right people for any given challenge or task.\n* Training add-on: We offer community management training, as well as training for management of the forum and best practices to help them be successful.\n* Consulting add-on: We can take on community management, content curation, event coordination and even co-apply with our clients for research projects, grants or open calls.\n\n\n1.

So that your events generate consistently generate high roi for participants and for your organisation.\n\n1. Example: AI & Justice Summit - Booklet\n2. Demo: Invitation - Registration - articles on platform - summary post & discussion - booklet.\n\n#### Always-on video chat webinar and break out meeting rooms\n\nThese are intended for things like running online events where you need breakout rooms, running team meetings or setting up a digital watercooler spaces for spontaneous chats. They are only available to people with user accounts on your online platform.\n\n1. Features: We need to ask Maria and Owen about this!\n2.

That chatbot relays and aggregates the contents onto a platform where an editor can then put together a summary of what has been said and send it back to the people who participated.  **Use case is that frontline medical workers and activists are largely sharing information and coordinating via messaging apps**  . The problem with this is that: 1) it is not clear that the information shared is accurate 2) people are just overwhelmed with the sheer volume of info 3) there is no documentation of what has been exchanged \u2014 so no way of passing on learning in case of a new crisis 4) you do not keep track of who has contributed what - which means that you do not know who the real experts are that you could then turn to in the future for help.  **We have already developed some of the code to enable this: Now we need a rough sketch of a nice, simple user experience and interface/information architecture that works for people who are really short on time and super stressed.

We are working here:**   **[#t_edgeryders_an1s2t4bxd](https://euvsvirus.slack.com/archives/C0123B1JS2Z)**\n\n#### Campaign builder\n**We have developed a stack of modules that enable you to quickly set up a single purpose minisite and it with relevant content**  .This makes it easy and inexpensive to so things like set up a website around a specific activity such as conference or crowdfunding campaign. As well as present content picked from the online forum that enables your to feature discussion threads or high quality posts with little additional work. Everything is easily updated through the platform. Examples include: [http://er-campaigns.surge.sh](http://er-campaigns.surge.sh/), [work.edgeryders.eu](http://work.edgeryders.eu/), https://youthful-brown-c96bcf.netlify.com/ and [crowdfund.edgeryders.eu](http://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n#### Rapid Landing Page generator\nWe have developed a stack of modules that enable you to quickly set up a single purpose with relevant content .This makes it easy and inexpensive to so things like set up a website around a specific activity such as conference or crowdfunding campaign.

For example you may want to limit access to people who participated in the preparatory conversations or participated in a previous activity. It is also useful if you want to do crowdfunding campaigns where one of the perks is to have one\u2019s questions featured during the webinar. Example here: https://live.edgeryders.eu/\n\n\n\n### A word about our tools\n\n**If you can't open it, then you don't own it**.  Everything we build is open source, so there are no hidden licensing fees or vendor-set constraints. Also, it makes it easier for others to spot and fix any security bugs, Something which you cannot  rely on with commercial technology vendors that avoid scrutiny and sometimes even penalise those who do identify critical security flaws which put their users at risk. An added benefit with using your own installation of our data is that you don't have to worry about us selling your data to third parties because the data sits on your own servers. *Why you should care about this:*\n\n-----\n\n# A low risk way to introduce it and train your staff\nEdgeryders can provide an already animated environment where you or your staff can develop the right skillsets and practices without need to make the full investment into setting up and maintaining your own platform. This enables us to easily connect with others interested in, and engaging around, our topics of interest. This means you do not have to get the conversation going. Deepen the discussions. Build visualisations to show points of convergence with others as a foundation for potential collaborations around emergent insights. White label option: We can also help you to install and customise your own platform.\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\nEnquiries: company@edgeryders.eu", "created_at": "2020-05-09 08:06:13.387144", "updated_at": "2020-05-28 07:58:29.157017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2019, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27460, "user_id": 87, "topic_id": 1298, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Lyne, your support is always appreciated.\n\nI wanted to clarify a couple of points not specific to the map.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Government in The Lab remains as the online magazine, focused on government and politics around the world.</li>\n\n<li>Citizens in The Lab is an online community, newly launched, focused on trying to educate citizens, collaborate, crowdsource, efforts.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>Both will work in tandem to deliver great information and help to lead to more community based projects.\u00a0 I am hopeful that Citizens in The Lab can jump in and help out the Edgeryders community by embracing needs raised and delivering solutions.\n\nYou are right, however, that the solutions may be quick (if just me doing it) or, as we grow this community in size, more elaborate and more useful.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-31 21:06:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.709759", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 145, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12373], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76151, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13466, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Cool!

Then, the prestigious Conference \"Gitex Technology Week\" but unfortunately we didn't get the Visa. After that and with the same project, I was selected among Top 200 in the WeMENA program held by the World Bank as young female entrepreneur and founder.\nThankful for the amazing dynamic team and the progress that we have made during this period, we are  selected now as finalist in Social Impact Award Tunisia 2017. \nThis startup could change the healthcare forever and save lives!

Because there will be quite some young entrepreneurs tired of living with their parents, and looking for a nice but very affordable home. If that happens to be a live-in startup incubator, all the better.\n\n**Pick to pay.** There is a social issue in Kathmandu in that coffee is considered a \"high class\" beverage, quite unaffordable for ordinary people. So, a nice opportunity to deconstruct that. Idea: have 1-2 special tables in the caf\u00e9 where people come to chill / hang out and get coffee and seats for free, as much as they want, if they sort a bowl of coffee beans that comes along with every cup of coffee. The desks would be clean bright desks suited for sorting, with bright lamps, giving a reason why not everyone in the caf\u00e9 can take part in this scheme. There is not a hygiene problem at all, since all germs will die when roasting at \u2265170 \u00b0C.\n\n**Coffee picking as a service.** Potentially, the \"pick to pay\" concept even makes business sense, and can be commercialized by offering Kathmandu's coffee traders and exporters to sort their coffee for a fee. Coffee has to be sorted to become high quality or even speciality quality coffee, and there is probably not a single optical sorter machine in Nepal for that. So the only option is hand sorting, as for 80% of the world's coffee. (Until our [open source optical sorter](http://fairdirect.org/blog/open-source-optical-sorter) is developed and built, that is.)\n\n**Align with a makerspace.** A good proposal could be to find a space close to an existing makerspace / hackerspace, like Communitere Nepal. So people get the best from both worlds: nice coffee and good Internet in the co-working space, accommodation in the co-living space, but also a workshop with tools etc..\n\n**Hosting international volunteers.** A good secondary target group for the accommodation, because they mingle well with students, are international volunteers (for example from AIESEC). They have usually less of a problem than students to afford room rent, so can cross-finance others' space rent a bit.\n\n**Get the co-working space for free.** As we calculated when looking at the FOAM candidate space in Brussels, it is possible to get the co-working area \"free\", covered by the rent of people in the co-living space. This relieves it of the pressure to make a profit on its own, which can greatly enhance user experience by being much less commercialized. And from that relaxed, enjoyable setting, a lot of popularity and other options to make a profit may come, who knows.\n\n**Don't waste the coffee smell :-)** Coffee smell is precious and almost universally loved. After roasting, the coffee has to cool down, and cure. That can be done in such a way that the smell goes into the guestroom. Maybe that's the reason for the bean bags in John's photo above \u2026\n\n**Offer students to pay in kind.** Another social entrepreneurship option, which will be well received among students who come to Kathmandu from the villages, can be to offer them to pay with their own services for accommodation, not in money. That's quite simple here, as it's not just a rental space but a business that can offer paid work. Managing all the components of this symbiotic business cluster needs some low to medium skill manual labor, and people living on-site are the most natural candidates for that. They can work, for (say) 8 hours a week as barista, janitor, coffee roaster, coffee packaging, IT admin, cook, kitchen help, or guard. Pitfalls to avoid are (1) it must not result in a two-tier \"class hierarchy\" of those who can pay and those who must serve, (2) it has to be manage legally safe and sound (no \"black labor\") while avoiding or automating away the bureaucracy involved for hiring people.\n\n**Agile bedroom management.** Since many students prefer low costs over high comfort, and because it offers additional capacity around events and high demand times, bedrooms should be more managed like a hotel. So, inhabitants and guests alike would not have their own permanent room, but get a free room when they come in. When they travel or sleep out, even if just for a night, they can (or have to?) clear the room, and in exchange don't have to pay for that time. All of this can be managed with open source [resource scheduling software](/t/id/6629). For added comfort, as a permanent place to store their belongings, everyone would get a special rollable shelf that can even go up and down stairs like a sack barrow. To store more, the less used items can go into a personal, lockable storage cabinet in a special storage room or in the corridor. To accommodate even more guests during brief \"peak demand\" times, there could be additional beds in store, so that people comfortable with each other can share rooms.\n\n**Crowd-funding with rewards.** To have the funds for furnishing and equipping the space (in a small initial version) including coffee processing equipment, a crowdfunding campaign seems very realistic. It would target mostly travellers from abroad who love Nepal and come back often. They can easily afford investing 100-500 USD each, in return for a guestroom they can book for free when in Nepal.  This is aligned to member benefits from the proposed [network of OpenVillage houses](/t/id/6785). 50 people donating 150 USD on average would yield 7500 USD, which is enough to start a small version of this space in Nepal. It can then grow from reinvesting its profits, or utilize growing popularity for follow-up \"round B, C, D\" crowdfunding campaigns with the same principle.\n\n**Crowd-investing with rewards.** Another way to distribute crowdfunding rewards is transform it into a crowd-investing model, with with capped profits rather than permanent shares. For that, you create [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons/) coupons for the space, to be redeemed against all products and services of the space after a certain holding period. For investing 100 USD, funders would get a for example 200 USD or 250 USD of coupons, and could either redeem them by themselves when in Nepal, or exchange them on PayCoupons for other coupons they want.\n\n**Sharing equipment.** A good part of what makes co-living a low-cost alternative is sharing space. Similarly, by sharing equipment the rest of life can also cost less. For a co-living arrangement in Kathmandu, that would mostly be bicycles, electric bicycles, motorcycles / scooters, a small workshop with tools, perhaps a gym pass.\n\n**Own energy, own water, own food.** A good part of the OpenVillage vision is self-supply, to lower costs of living. In Kathmandu, this is quite possible: (1) have a rainwater collection and filtering system, as that can provide enough water throughout the year, (2) add photovoltaics panels to the roof and have a 24 V DC system with batteries, for lighting and computers, (3) use self-built electrical bicycles and electrical scooters for transport, charged at home from photovoltaics power, (4) collect organic trash from the neighborhood and create biogas for cooking (and for roasting the coffee), using a 1-4 biogas digesters on the roof, (5) create compost from biogas digestate and other organic trash, (6) partially grow own food by rooftop and courtyard gardening. Neighbours could be persuaded to provide their rooftops for free if these gardens are nice to look at and to relax in the shadow of the plants. The equipment for all this technology should be mobile, prepared to move places without much effort. It would be standardized, resulting from a shared development effort among multiple OpenVillage houses.", "created_at": "2017-09-05 23:51:09.767074", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 16:46:07.427169", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1328, "wiki": false, "reads": 39, "score": 157.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 4, 3804, 3799], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77094, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13598, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n### Dear community,\n\n*Here a short overview of some of the currently ongoing conversations:*\n\n**This conversation here about the power imbalances in big tech and remote work touches on many of our core topics:**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/a-second-coming-of-big-tech-in-the-age-of-covid-19/13564\n\n**A while ago we started this conversation on how to understand statistics in the context of the current crisis and the emotional effect of it:**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/statistically-feeling-bad/12845\n\n**Data can be gathered and interpreted in many ways, and we think we should talk more about it.

No big deal though._\n\n\n**1 - GETTING IN TOUCH WITH AN ARTIST**\n\nit is the biggest part of the work.\nYou need a very specific profile of artist: you need him able to **record on location** (so you need **someone with nomad equipment**, if you can't provide it to him), and maybe produce on location as well : those two aspects will probably lead you more into electronic music than any music with instruments btw... **You also need him/her to be from Morocco** for the reasons previously discussed.\nYou can find this kind of artist on a platform named [BANDCAMP](https://bandcamp.com/). It's a very known and prosper distribution platform for independent artists, making a real INCREDIBLE work on every aspect of the music industry business. The website is very well conceived, and **you can dig out plenty of talents from everywhere around the globe**. **Try out some hashtags** linked to your researched profile (\"morocco\", \"sidi kaouiki\", \"essaouira\"), and try to **get in touch with the artist you're interested by**. If you want a little help, I might still have a few contacts in the Now, **what an artist and music producer needs to know first** is what the project will give and take to/from him/her. It can be a lot of things here:\n_give:_ the experience of working with a community of do-ers, exp of working with youth, the ecological / transmission / educationnal / creative mindset, money (?), hardware and equipment (?), support of Edgeryders (?), proper release on bandcamp for instance (and streaming/distribution platform), and anything that comes to your mind.\n_take:_ time (how much? more or less...), hardware and equipment (depending on how nomadic is his/her production set up), and that might be it, as you don't want this list to be too deep ahah!\nnote that I'm not saying that artists are always self centered people only thinking about their own self, but I always experienced that the more you give them the feeling that you understand their needs, the more they will give it back to you x100.\n\n\n**2 - GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A PLATFORM**\n\nOnce you find an agreement with an artist, step two comes in very fast. So if you feel good and confortable, earlier on the line, to **get your hands into Bandcamp by [creating a \"label\" account](https://bandcamp.com/labels) and check the possibilities you have with this platform**, and what it will take you to release something there (music file formats wise, promotionnal wise, but also little things such as artwork, banners, and maybe the name of the project itself).\n**It's actually simplier and easier than anything I could write** to sum it up. it is specifically made to answer the needs of small projects, amateur artists, confirmed indie labels, famous niche artists, anybody but the major actually.\nAt this point, your main thing to check is to agree with the artist and the children (and their parents) on how you will release the result: for \"free\", for a \"specific price\", or as \"name your price\". And as much as there could be money involved: where does it go in the end, and how.\n\n**3 - GETTING THE RESULT RELEASED AND PROMOTED**\nNow this could be both exciting and boring at the same time. ah!\nit could be great to see the community of Edgeryders gather around such a creative project resulting from an open village presence in a local community. Wich could lead to **a good self promotion of it**, and possibly some coverage in specific medias linked to music, and/or communities, etc.\nSo that means: newsletters, videos, photos, fb/ig/tw posts, ER platform posts, interviews, and **everything that the documentation (filming, recording, shooting) of the project while it's happening could give you, of any kind of formats imaginable.**\n\n\n\n**SIDE NOTES:**\n\nI believe it could possibly have an impact in the future of Open Village projects: it could lead more creative minds to get involved, it could lead to festivals that would see music, tech and workshops being programmed in the same location at the time, bringing people of many really different profiles to interact with each others.\nAnd **as culture is one of the more meaningful and fragile common** that exists in communities, and with Edgeryders producing ideas and projects around many other commons, it could lead to build something like \"Open-Culture\" or \"Open-Art\" topic(s), here to be discussed just as Open-Care is for instance. _ping @alberto @nadia_  \n\n\nSo that's the best you could try to do for a first project.\n**But don't mind it if you just want to start a little smaller**, by simply inviting an artist to join the workshop for a time being, or give him the freedom to handle step 2 and 3 on hiw own... I don't know, it's just how you feel it.\n\nI'll be there with my former experience in that business, and a couple of contacts that I still have, if you need any kind of advices or introduction emails, etc. So hit me whenever you need! :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-03-22 20:54:39.111638", "updated_at": "2018-03-22 21:03:06.080504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 941, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 28.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43115], "is_liked_by": [3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77096, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13599, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n### Dear community,\n\n*Here a short overview of some of the currently ongoing conversations:*\n\n**This conversation here about the power imbalances in big tech and remote work touches on many of our core topics:**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/a-second-coming-of-big-tech-in-the-age-of-covid-19/13564\n\n**A while ago we started this conversation on how to understand statistics in the context of the current crisis and the emotional effect of it:**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/statistically-feeling-bad/12845\n\n**Data can be gathered and interpreted in many ways, and we think we should talk more about it.

Thanks for sharing your story here on the platform, it's really helpful for us the organisers to know a bit about everyone in the room. This enables our community managers @MariaEuler and @johncoate to support meaningful networking before and after the event by connecting people across mutual or complementary interests and needs. We found this kind of support is often the thing most lacking in events, so we decided to set up our process to facilitate this.\n\nLike your coworking and coliving set up Edgeryders in its current form as a kind of virtual coworking methodology and tools started out as a spin off of another project. But we started out online from the beginning with the founders living in different parts of the world, and only now are starting to establish roots in some places as a collective (even though the individuals ourselves are rooted in Stockholm, Tunis, Brussels, California, and somewheres in Germany (one of my co-founders Matthias lives in a converted firefighter truck that he moves around the country). \n\nWhen it comes to coworking and coliving we have learned alot from three initiatives. One is the unMonastery - a secular alternative for living and working together modelled on the Benedictine monastic orders. We prototyped it in Matera, Italy. Another is the prototype of a new program we built for/with the World Bank yielded some interesting results in which it could be interesting to explore potential for strategic partnerships with coworking spaces - the report will be out soon so i cannot say much about it yet, but if someone reminds me maybe Ill talk about it during our event. The third is the experiment @alberto @noemi and @matthias have been running in Brussels (and @hugi is exploring for the community spaces in Stockholm)- we are now fundraising and building strategic partnerships for rolling it out at a bigger scale:\n\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/381876735?byline=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/381876735\"></a><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user19087695\"></a>  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\"></a></p>\n<br>\n\n\nI am curious about something: How much/ for how long would you say that the sustainability of your space was linked to the spin off from your family business? \n\nI ask because we are experimenting our own model for a new kind of living and working space made for a happier, healthier, greener and more social lifestyle. Here we are thinking not so much about digital nomads, but people anchored in the local community (with families etc).  We have been experimenting models for we can support new income generation for people during times of instability due to e.g financial crisis/ climate change. One option we have been testing for ourselves is having the core revenue generator for coworking spaces in the buildings be specific businesses like how you started.\n\n\n\n\n**Curious to hear about any experiences you or other participants may have** related to this?", "created_at": "2020-07-12 08:10:33.083382", "updated_at": "2020-07-13 08:16:07.407948", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 518, "wiki": false, "reads": 41, "score": 103.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 6512], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65987, "user_id": 5676, "topic_id": 11914, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Ispostavilo se da ve\u0107 poznajem dosta u\u010desnika radionice, bila je prijateljska atmosfera. .

That's what I tried to say.\n\nDrupal comes with a great plugin system, thousands of plugins to choose from, or to add your own. But so far, we don't have the developers to do that on top of the general-purpose tool. It would be great if we had, but we're just at the start of creating an open source developer community and do not have much other options for finding additional developers.\n\nSo, when planning what we <em>can</em> create right now, it's either a good general tool or a good specific software.

So can this attitude taken toward the pandemic be applied to the ecological crisis that also faces us?\n\nAs society strives to rebuild itself towards a post-Covid world, creating green economies is not only mandatory, but an opportunity. At Edgeryders we have been asking ourselves, and each other, how we can possibly create new systems that address social issues and are more sustainable.\n\nAn excellent example of how these systems can be built, is that of the district of Messina in Sicily, Italy. [We held a webinar recently with one of the co-founders of Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 di Messina](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14443), which reintegrated patients at a local mental health institute back into society and used the money the government normally pays to keep them there to buy solar panels and transform a community that was\n\nThe initiative benefited the local community, because it reduced the consumption of fossil fuels, provided further funding from the green subsidies for the organisation to invest in other projects, successfully reintegrated vulnerable cities back into the community, and spawned several new businesses. It highlights that the transition to a green economy is part of a much larger picture.\n\nFondazione di Comunit\u00e0 di Messina has been pioneering in four ways when it comes to the systems it has built:\n\n1. It\u2019s attitude to relational goods (understanding there is a human side to physical goods)\n2. Chooses stocks over cash flows (ie invests in solar panels rather than obtaining grants which come and go)\n3. It operates as a malleable system that reacts and adapts to change rather than a network that solves one problem\n4. Operates a Dyson\u2019s sphere model that gives prosperity to every member of the system\n\nFor a more detailed read on that see [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14486).\n\nEdgeryder co-founder Matthias has put together various blueprints for how [cities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-autarky-system-for-cities/9141) and [rural regions](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-rural-living/7566) can adopt self-sustainable policies and infrastructure. Here's further reading on [what the future of urban living](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-urban-living/12097) can look like.\n\nThe past few months have also showed us that a different way of work is achievable - one that lessens commutes, exhaust fumes and allows workers more control of their lives, if implemented correctly.\n\nWhen not done correctly, however, work can seep into your daily lives and take over, leading to burnout. On top of that, many countries are now facing their second waves of cases, and some of us are balancing family needs and work life while daycare and schools are closed.\n\nThe co-working sector could address some of these concerns. With one of our [co-founders asking how spaces could make life easier for freelancers](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14504). We have also discussed on the forum that the sector could be an [answer to the challenges surrounding childcare](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14331) at a recent webinar that looked at co-working\u2019s recovery.\n\n**Don't forget...**\n\nOur conversations aren\u2019t only happening on the platform, some upcoming events that are also discussing what our future may look like:\n\n* 8/10: [Citizen engagement and regional policies ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-session-on-citizen-engagement-in-euregionsweek-sneak-peek/14489)in the transition to a viable low carbon economy.\n* 16/10 : [Info session about our new World Building academy! ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14481)We are launching a residency in collaboration with EIT Climate Kic as part of our Scifi Economics Lab.\n* 30/10: [How can we work together to support localisation of food?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-event-invitation-sustainable-agriculture-and-food/14493) A webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond.\n\n**Please leave a comment below if you have any thoughts on how we can transition our economy to a green and better future.**\n\n---\nImage by Note Thanun  on Unsplash", "created_at": "2020-10-05 08:44:33.901811", "updated_at": "2020-12-03 13:06:49.721900", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 734, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71788, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12885, "post_number": 8, "raw": "[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:5, topic:12885\"]\nI\u2019d like to add a \u201cChallenge\u201d to the discussion over there, which is increased dependence on digital infrastructure in the hands of non-public institutions (yeah, my favorite topic, Open Source).\n[/quote]\n\n\nHell yeah, @felix.wolfsteller. \n\nWe are having that discussion in Edgeryders.

Misreporting is endemic. It was around before either of us were born, and we had to develop navigation tools around them. Using them is more effective than complaining.\n[/quote]\nI am not surprised but that. I am surprised so many people are not aware of that and those who are often don't seem to be bothered by it. Just because it has been there for so long, doesn't mean we should accept it as normal.\nWhat navigation tools? I would like to know more about your logic there. We are being more and more controlled...it is becoming increasingly difficult to get real information.\nAs @nadia stated in her replies...we live in the age of spin and misinformation. It takes a lot of energy to get real understanding of things. Usually very few people have time for that nowdays, I certainly almost never do. Right now I should go back to my programming course, but this subject really got under my skin and I am very worried for the world of our children.\n \nThat's why I cite people who risk everything stating what they state or publishing the data they publish. People not financed for researching but the very same people whose wealth could increase by billions, depending of the outcome of the research. People not paid huge amounts of money for pushing a certain narrative. Kind of obvious where the conflict of interest lies, when on the other side you have very highly paid individuals or people who invested billions in the matter. \n\nOn top of that, when I see people who risk so much, being censured, silenced or punished without any real scientific evidence their statements are harmful for anyone, I for sure will pay closer attention to what they have to say. Just basic logic. If there was clear evidence their statements are false and damaging, it would or should be brought up publicly through proper channels.\nSo when you state \"some guy from youtube or facebook\", you basically don't take into considerations their achievements/experience or sources they site...as he did not appear on the official communication channel or as part of an approved organisation? I mean, that is ridiculous as that person is already silenced a great deal.\nHere is a [guy](https://www.facebook.com/nicolas.graillot.9/posts/10157223700102447) who knows a lot about media, who quit and went solo, challenging the main narrative. His main reason for quitting is \"I have 5 children\", That should tell you a lot, as the guy left a successful and very lucrative career for that. His content is constantly being deleted etc...\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:37, topic:14462\"]\nThat sounds like procurement. Which is a highly political process, with all the known bugs of capture, posturing, short-termism etc. etc. Why would you call it science?\n[/quote]\n\nThat's my whole point. This whole crap is politically motivated and there is no science behind it. As a man of science, I thought you would appreciate that example.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:37, topic:14462\"]\nThat said, the science here is in Lancet\u2019s (and other journals\u2019) retractions. It is unfair to complain to \u201cscience\u201d because the media misreport stuff.\n[/quote]\nI am not complaining to science, certainly Lancet has a great deal of respect from me as they kept their integrity. They no doubt face huge pressure...it is clear why they are the world's no1 medical journal.\nI am just pointing out the huge gaps in the policy makers' approach. Being as far as possible from real science.\n\nThe research you included is about the masks effectiveness, which is kind of obvious. That was never a question, question was how were they used.\nWay more serious things here are the points I raised already or included in links.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:37, topic:14462\"]\nI run a high risk of picking the wrong sources, and missing out on the right ones. But then, so do you. It\u2019s life. If you, given your readings, want to go for hydroxycloroquine, more power to you. We stand to learn from what your actions. Will you treat me, and the rest of us, with the same courtesy?\n[/quote]\nTotally agree with you on risk of picking the wrong sources. Not on the 2nd part. Hydroxycloroquine was **made illegal** or doctors and pharmacists were **very strongly recommended not to prescribe or sell it**. You know that great majority of them are on the pharma payroll anyway. That was my whole point. They have made decisions based on 0 science. That decision **took away many people's right of choice**, and potentially harmed a lot of people.\nMy problem is not with science, my problem is with \"science\" or manipulation of the same by \"experts\" who are experts only in politics and power structures. Manipulation both by scientists and policy makers.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:37, topic:14462\"]\nSorry, that\u2019s been disproved since 1945, when Popper published *The open society and its enemies* . The argument is called the [paradox of tolerance ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance), and it is no longer challenged by any serious scholar.\n[/quote]\nWow, nice excuse for so much stuff, we can expand it indefinitely. I am not surprised the argument made sense back then, after seeing nazi Germany rise so easily. That for me goes in pair with people misusing the \"survival of the fittest\" to justify all kinds of crap. Now, we can say it was misunderstood and give them the benefit of the doubt. My thinking is, it was understood as the observer had certain preconceptions/mindset and wanted it to mean exactly that...so still having full responsibility. \n\nWell good thing people made that argument obsolete by actually doing things and proving they work in practice. In fact that practice is the only way to build bridges between polarised communities and influence the \"intolerant ones\".\n\nTrust me when I say I know a lot about polarised communities. I have been in deeply divided society, full of distrust, sometimes hatred, mostly deep annoyance and prejudice. All that can only be bridged with exposure. Exposure to the other side through various activities together, or just meeting normal decent people, or talking with peers who had experiences with \"the other side\" etc.\nI have 100 examples from my life. The best example we have here in Belgium is the Flamish and French. I know people from both community and, talking with them, I realised most have prejudice because of lack of interaction with the other side and political influence...as some idiotic politicians always score points on nationalism.\n\nHere is the example of a [guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGTQ0Wj6yIg&ab_channel=PowerfulJRE) who did exactly that and had amazing results. An Afroamerican seeking out KKK members and literally turning them away from that crap. A real hero for me.\n\nI also had a specific case in my family, with my little brother who was indoctrinated in a special nazi ideology. it is easy when it is \"the other side\", some random people somewhere you don't know. So you have no empathy, or need to build that bridge. So just censure them and push them underground. Let them victimise themselves even more, and surround themselves in an echo bubble.\nWould you do the same if it was your brother or father?\nMy point here is, we need more empathy and interaction and we can reach people in great majority of cases. If you support your arguments with science, logic and real world examples, you can certainly reach more people than if you push them away.\nIt's all good when you have scholars writing about it, discussing it but, real world is most of the time something very different.\n\nThat line of thinking can be applied only in extreme cases, I certainly didn't state I wouldn't censor anything at all. As i clearly stated in the examples above, that we can dominate any debate in those examples with facts and logic. That is supported by the argument you linked.\n\nThis part specifically:\nPopper expands upon this, writing, \"I do not imply for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would be most unwise.\n\n[quote=\"jasen_lakic, post:34, topic:14462\"]\nAs long as you have an open discussion, you cannot lose really. Why? Well because their arguments make no sense and can so easily be dismantled. If you do it publicly or through debate, you will have waaaaaay bigger impact than if you just ban them from talking.\n[/quote]\nI further added the ban would have the counter productive effect.\n\nI don't see any conflicting logic in these 2 statements.

That took some time. A big part of the refactor was making sure that we use Apollo to fetch data from the backend in a sane way, rather than fetch everything from the database when the page loads and then refetch everything every time the user triggers a mutation. The previous search was built on the idea that we have the entire database cached in the frontend. Now it actually fetches results from the backend based on the search term entered by the user.\n\nThe things I have left to do are:\n\n1. Deleting needs and responsibilities\n2.

The co-occurrences graph for co-occurrences &gt;= 4 now looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/64e162d7e48c7b8983402c4b78189f78e5ab1480.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"371\">\n\nIt reflects your answer very well, @Amelia . <code class=\"content-command\">mental health</code>\u00a0has moved yet closer into the center of the graph (in November it was connected to it only via \"skill sharing\"). <code class=\"content-command\">legality</code>\u00a0is still in the same position, as the only hub connecting some in-graph codes like <code class=\"content-command\">autonomy</code>, <code class=\"content-command\">sustainability</code>, <code class=\"content-command\">community-based care</code> and <code class=\"content-command\">migration</code> ; and some out-graph codes like <code class=\"content-command\">existing system failure</code> and, yes, <code class=\"content-command\">safety</code>.\u00a0\n\nDid you reply based on browsing the graph, or was it just off the top of your head, based on having done the coding?\u00a0\n\nThe recent expansion of the discussions around mental health is, I think, tied to the onboarding workshop we organised in Galway in December 2016. Apparently the West of Ireland has an endemic suicide problem, especially among men. This has raised public awareness of issues like depression. So a lot of the people doing open care there are focused on mental care.\u00a0\n\nFinally, there is an interesting regularity. Try\u00a0\"stressing\" the co-occurrences graph, by imposing that the number of co-occurrences sustaining each edge is higher than 4: at 5, 6 and even 7 the graph seems to be telling me the same story, although it gets more and more barebones-simple as you increase the minimum required edge strength. At co-occurrences &gt;= 7 you get this:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b6dc0d878aa6274fe8af17ca81e6177254ba5818.jpg\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\">\n\nWhat are we talking about here? Well, if you ignore <code class=\"content-command\">research\u00a0question</code>, as we should, <code class=\"content-command\">community-based care</code> becomes the center of the graph. It connects to <code class=\"content-command\">legality</code> and to <code class=\"content-command\">resource strain</code>, itself connected with <code class=\"content-command\">crisis</code> and <code class=\"content-command\">migration</code>. The latter is then connected to two\u00a0codes representing solutions, or at least concepts underpinning solutions: <code class=\"content-command\">building relationships</code> and <code class=\"content-command\">story sharing</code>. <code class=\"content-command\">mental health</code> and <code class=\"content-command\">open processes</code> are each at the center of its own component: they are very important concepts (edge strength is at least 7!), but with a weaker connection to <code class=\"content-command\">community-based care</code> than codes in the giant component. I don't know if this is an artefact of Amelia's approach to coding or the signature of a coherent conversation, coded well. What do you think? Are we looking at <em>Amelia</em> thinking, or are we looking at <em>the community</em> thinking? Amelia? @Federico_Monaco ?\n\nMaybe\u00a0the way to present these (secondary) data\u00a0is to start from a very high edge strength (5-7) to give ourselves a high-level description, and only then go on to lower our requirements on edge strength to discover new codes and new connections. It would be like looking at volcaninc islands emerging from the ocean: as they are pushed up, what looked initially as a set of disconnected islands reveals itself as the peaks of the same mountain range.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-25 06:53:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.179284", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9312], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80772, "user_id": 4793, "topic_id": 14088, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Yup (below), but give me please 10 minutes.

The place I was born and where I spent nearly my whole life until now or the place my parents were born.\u00a0I normally say: \u201eI\u00b4m from Berlin (or \u201eI was born in Berlin\u201c), but my parents come from China.\u201c\u00a0But it\u00b4s in fact a difficult question for me to answer. Because my roots are also from China. And my parents have been in Germany for such a long time.\u00a0When I just say: \u201eI\u00b4m from Berlin.\u201c, sometimes they ask: \u201eAnd your roots\u201c?\u00a0\n\nLast semester I spent the time in Jena and Kahla, which is in east Germany.\u00a0There I\u00b4ve been told many times: \u201eOh, your German is so good!\u201c In Berlin I\u00b4ve been told this also some times, but not that often. I think the people there are just not used to see people with migration backgrounds that often. I can\u00b4t say it\u00b4s rude that they say it. Actually it\u00b4s a compliment!\n\nBefore I get to different food cultures, especially the differences between German and Chinese foodculture, I want to write about the topic foodculture in general and how it leads toward communication.\u00a0It has happened many times that after people knew where my roots come from they talk about their touch points with that culture. And often it starts with the food topic! There are many chinese restaurants spread in Europe, so the people get in touch with one part of the culture. Of course the food doesn\u00b4t taste originally like the food in China, but similar. They say: \u201eI love chinese food!\u201c and sometimes they can even say some words, like \u201eni hao\u201c, which means \u201ehello\u201c in Chinese.\u00a0I think that food is a good topic to start a conversation and also a good starting point to get to know the culture of a country!\n\nFood is a really big topic in China. While people in Germany or Europe often talk about the weather, chinese people talk about food. I realised that on my trip to china last year. The food topic appeared permanently on the way with my mum and her former classmates.\u00a0But you don\u00b4t need to travel that far to get an idea of the chinese foodculture.\u00a0Have you realised that in chinese restaurants are always those round tables with a turning glass plate on it? When my parents, chinese family friends and I go for chinese dinner, we always sit around that kind of table. One person takes a look at the menu and orders many different dishes for everyone. After a while the dishes, beside bowls with rice and a teapot appear on the glass plate. Then the people turn the glass plate to take a bit from different dishes. Everybody has a bowl, but it is so small that you normally take a bit from different dishes, eat a bit and take a bit again. Everybody shares the food with each other. People are chatting, eating and drinking together.\u00a0If you are just four people you don\u00b4t need a round table with a turning plate on in of course. But the procedure is similar. The dishes are in the middle of the table and you pick what you want. With your own chopsticks or a shared spoon. At home we also eat chinese food for dinner and we do it the same way. I like the way of sharing food. The process of eating is somehow very\u00a0interactive, because you also interact with people through interacting with the food.\n\nIn a German restaurant, everybody usually orders for himself. You focus more on what you would like to eat. It seems to be more individualistic.\n\n<strong>Care through cooking and eating together</strong>\n\nI think taking time for cooking something nice for yourself or other people is also a sign of caring for yourself and other people. It makes fun to cook together and it\u00b4s also possible to learn something from each other. Especially when you have different cultural backgrounds. It is also a possibility to meet on an eye level.\u00a0Also when you eat together, you\u00a0have something to do and have the possibility to start a conversation - maybe about food!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-24 23:30:42", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:44:35.622523", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 765, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63630, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 11467, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I am a person who was accidentally born in the former Yugoslavia. When I say by accident, I mean is that my parents were young students when I was born, obviously, they didn't know much about contraception. I was brought up as a cosmopolitan. I ended up working in 57 or 58 countries worldwide. On both sides, my grandparents were teachers. My parents ended up being university professors, I was destined to become a university professor. \n\nI was the best high school student in the former Yugoslavia and I was given an opportunity to choose where I wanted to continue my education. I had read in the newspapers that the Bay Area \u2014 meaning Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco \u2014 was the place to be at the late 60s, with hippies, with riots, with the sexual revolution. It was THE place for me to continue my studies, I decided.\n\nI ended up being among the best students in that school as well. Not just in the studies, but also in sports. I was already a master in judo. I was a swimmer. I was an ice skater, mountain climber and others. \n\nBut I decided to go back, because iI felt I was supposed to return to my country and contribute to it. I decided to go into the medical field. And I knew from the very beginning that I wouldn\u2019t be a typical doctor: I was going to be a forensic pathologist. \n\nBut when the Civil War started \u2014 as both a judo trainer and a forensic pathologist \u2014 I had seven of my ex Judo colleagues on my autopsy table in one day. They were killed in the war. I was the President of the doctors association, but I decided that enough was enough. Although I was quite a well known forensic pathologist worldwide \u2014 I had worked at Scotland Yard in England and for the FB. I wrote my doctoral thesis at Stanford, was at NYU and at Cornell. \n\nBut I decided one morning that it would be my last day in the medical field. I decided I\u2019d turn my hobby into my work: being a coach and trainer. My hobby was Applied Psychology in sports. The psychology of sports is more or less like the psychology of life. Because life is a struggle, life is a success, life is something that we aim for, to become champions. The technology of success is more or less the same. \n\nI ended up lecturing, visiting 57 countries coaching people in Applied Psychology, being a public speaker. My only handicap is that I come from where I come from. Otherwise, I would probably be one of the most well-known public speakers and trainers in the world. I work with people like John Maxwell, one of the leading lecturers in the field of leadership. I work with Bob Proctor. \n\nI\u2019ve published 13 books so far in different areas of Applied Psychology: in management, leadership, stress management, time management. I ended up returning to the academic field, as a professor in communications. It\u2019s kind of unusual that somebody with a medical background ends up coaching and training quite well known, local and international professionals in politics, arts, theater, movies, etc. \n\nI was the head of different international teams for negotiations and more. So my life was quite International. And I didn't see a reason to  publish something in English, because plenty of literature is already out there. But one of my books is was quite well known and appreciated in Russia. Recently, I\u2019ve published a new book out, entitled \u201cFuture in the rear mirror.\u201d Itt summarize my life in 60 stories \u2014 what has directed me through life. \n\nI feel that we need to understand that we are very present in the lives of others, but we are not trained to see them. But we can learn from them if we are open minded. \n\nAlthough I was born in a family of two very young students, I was lucky and my dreams \u2014 things I visualized as a kid \u2014 became a reality. I\u2019m acquainted with 16 to 17 Nobel Prize winners, I\u2019ve worked in prestigious universities. I was an expert in different fields, I traveled the world, and I\u2019ve touched the lives of over a million people. \n\nI enjoy working with young people, especially because that's something that I was taught from the early years of my childhood: as long as you're curious, as long as you keep your mind open, as long as you have this childish curiosity your vital and you're and you're alive. Otherwise you'll turn into a zombie. \n\nBeing 67, I feel quite comfortable within myself. I actually feel quite young and I enjoy life. But also, knowing that if you want to be motivated, you need to build up a community of happy, motivated positive people around you. \n\nIn my professional life, I had roughly 4500 autopsies. This meant I was part of many tragic stories of the violence of death, of different family histories, and criminal backgrounds. This has  made me quite compatible with the realism of life, we do need to live moment to moment. That's something that I tend to transfer to my students regardless of their age and regardless of their field of  interest. Whether it's through sport, whether it's through my academic lectures or my seminars and workshops.\n\nI was invited by Jonkoping University in Sweden where I taught a subject called \u201cthe role of young people in their communities. It was about 12 or 14 years ago. I remember the curriculum, it was never too formal. This course had a direct link to my lifetime experience, because when I was preparing for the European Junior Championship, I was injured and I ended up in a coma for over three weeks. After that, I decided that I didn't want to continue with my sport activities in terms of competition and competing. Instead, I studied very hard to become one of the youngest coaches in judo and jujitsu. \n\nAs a result, from an early age, I realized that teaching was a valuable method: if you do something you have a tendency to forget after a while, but If you learn something through experience by transferring knowledge to somebody, then you dig deep into the background of the topic, the idea. And that's the best way to learn. \n\nI have students all over the world. And because of the time difference, I practically never sleep. Because when I finish with my students in New Zealand and Australia, then my students wake up in California. \n\nBut that's that's my life. I'm a teacher, and I enjoy it. \n\nWhen the time comes that I have to leave the planet, I want to leave only one virtual thing behind: Dr. Nick, the teacher. \n\nIn my career as Judo coach, I was affiliated with American Judo Academy, having the highest rank you can have in sports in Japanese martial arts:  Sensei, the Supreme teacher. This makes me very proud, because it was one of my dreams. The most important motivator is that self actualization, it\u2019s being somebody, being recognized, being useful. You want to be someone who isn't just a number or just a name, but some someone who makes a mark on other people. \n\nBesides my professional life of being a doctor and being a motivator, public speaker, and author, I\u2019m also the father of seven children. The span of the ages are between 7 and 40. It\u2019s quite a broad spectrum of experience with regards to different times, different ages, and of course the different places in the world where they grew up: different surroundings, circumstances and so on. \n\nJust before our interview, I had returned from the city. Now, looking back at the time 15 to 20 years ago, I cannot understand anymore where got the energy and the willpower from to live in places like Manhattan, like Tokyo, like Moscow,, like San Francisco. For me now, I have to drive 15 minutes to go to the city. In the past, it was quite normal for me to be stuck in traffic for two hours. I know it\u2019s all about perspective. \n\nMy interest then was to be part of the melting pot and to be as present as much as possible in the crowd. Now, I like to look at the things from aside, because the view is better. Although for me and my family it\u2019s generally never a problem to go to the city, it\u2019s only half an hour, it\u2019s not the South Pole. But it's another thing to think about, how your perception changes, how life changes.\n\nWhen I was young, the most important thing for me was to win the most prestigious prize or award. Now value lays in playing with my children and doing things like that. I guess that's the reason why in most of the past societies, you had this combination of those who are biologically and economically at the top who were middle-aged, and then you had the Council of the old, who directed them with their experiences. \n\nWhen we are young, we look at the things from case to case. After a while, if you are a good observer, you'll realize that quality of life exists starts from from physical health. Young people don't worry too much about it, because for them, it's understood that they are healthy, that they are strong, that they are vital. But if you want to be in balance, you want to be happy, you need to apply spiritual health, ecological health, and business health. This is vital wisdom older experienced people can transfer to young people. \n\nThe times have changed a lot in my home country especially. I lived in five different countries without moving. That's the dynamism of the world that we live in. But there are some principles which never change, that are pliable. I don\u2019t mean by imitating them like monkeys, but by moderating them and applying them to different aspects of life. \n\nFor example, whatever is in the past, whatever you cannot influence, forget about it. I don\u2019t mean forget the facts, but don't it interfere with your life. That's one of the principles very few people apply. \n\nOf course \u2014 knowing what I know as I was involved in building the largest brain bank in the world \u2014 I am aware of our limits. For example, comparing the brains of those who would jump in order to sue to commit suicide, to those who fell accidentally, I understand what our brain\u2019s biochemistry does as well. Different surroundings and topics influence our behavior. The question is, to what extent we can actively influence our state of mind and our emotions.\n\nIt's the reason why there are so many unhappy people worldwide. And why the concept of materialism within the globalization is influencing people: they look for happiness in material goods, in the outer world without sinking and deep diving into themselves. That's something  I can help with, but people have to do it \u2014 and find it \u2014 themselves. Because, if you don't like yourself, if you don't love yourself, why would somebody love you if you don't have anything to give? That's something people don't always understand. \n\nWhen I was very young, my first playmates weren\u2019t children, they were my parents\u2019 professors. And one of the things I learned from them very early on, is that if you can\u2019t you can explain something to a completely illiterate person, then you don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about yourself. \n\nI was the president of the Doctors Association, so I had over 4500 doctors around me. A lot of them tried to hide their ignorance within Latin phrases, they were hoping that it would get them respect. But it doesn't happen, because people want to understand what you\u2019re saying in very plain language.\n\nI was a professor of wellbeing theory at the postgraduate level at university. One of my colleagues mentioned they decided to give me the subject, because I enjoy living. Wellbeing is, first of all, an individual feeling of balance. And that's the balance that I was mentioning earlier. Without that balance, we are insecure, even being physically out of balance. In order to maintain that balance, we need to recognize that we have to oppose the gravity mediocrities. You need to be actively focused on who you are, who you want to be, where you want to go. And to be ready to do it yourself with or without support from others. \n\nWhen you achieve something more or less by accident, you are lost. You should know where you're going, and that you\u2019ll have to rely on yourself in getting there. Then, whatever you achieve, you'll get this psychological success, which means more self respect, which means more self confidence or more motivation. And that's something that people don't understand. Motivation is not like a gas selenium, go to the gas station and say, give me 10 bucks for all the gasoline motivation.\n\nEndurance is something that is part of this process. And the achievement itself is not a destination. Achieving is the road is from where you are, where you stand, to where you want to be. We\u2019re growing every step on the way. \n\nWhen the last day of your life comes and your turn back and look at your life, what would you want to have achieved? If you know that, and if you know that being young, you are more confident, more devoted to your mission, and you are more  likely to live a happy life. \n\nI ended up in Berkeley in late 60s, I met people who are hippies who turned into yuppieFor example Steve Jobs. Most of the people who knew him back then thought he was crazy. But he was crazy, just because he knew what he wanted. And most of the people didn\u2019t know. They were hoping that something will happen with their life, while people like Steve Jobs are creating their lives. Your own personal mission statement is very important. \n\nI want people to be aware of the fact that we can do whatever we think, whatever crosses our mind \u2014 not just by accident, but that it is something we can achieve. In order to achieve it, we need to know who our best friend is: our subconscious mind. Unfortunately, we are not trained to do so. When we realize that all those things that we want in our life, we need to visualize and mark them with positive, joyful feelings. Our visions are basically the models of our future life. We are influencing that border that we cannot see, the border where energy turns into matter and vice versa. \n\n## Post a thoughtful comment below ahead of the  **[workshop on \u201cCreativity and Entrepreneurship - Empowering Youth for Better Future\u201d ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/becej-serbia-workshop-creativity-and-entrepreneurship-empowering-youth-for-better-future/11188)** on November 19!\n\nThis will help us to prepare good case studies for exploring these topics in detail.

Separate discussions will overlap with technology.

For this, a gantt chart needs to be put together \u2013 Nadia and Marina will work on this on Thursday. \n\n-\tThe question was raised about what category / workspace exactly should be open in the case of POPREBEL due to the sensitivity of the subject and when to open it?

Also I think books are an extremely resource efficient vector for change, especially in certain parts of the environment.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is establishing a channel that allows information to travel the other way as well. For example one could design a page that encourages them to complete it or modify it in some way and send an MMS or picture of what they write/draw back to your organization. That way you could interact and learn more from the other side as well. You could also use (different) QR-codes to get their response in a less creative way.\n\nThe other thing I had to think of is Cory Doctorow.

The topics we are discussing reach from mental wellbeing to the use of new technologies for a more human digital world. We encourage people to share personal experiences and stories and try to not only learn from that but also help them to connect and find people to talk to and people to work with.\n\nEspecially during the current Corona Crisis, we have been working to help people and projects connect to enable them to realise their initiatives, solve their problems, and well, make a living.\n\nThe difference between \u201cdoing a job\u201d and \u201cdoing good work\u201d is one we take very seriously, and I dare say most of the people working in the Edgeryders team, but also those on the platform, in the community are actively searching and or pursuing alternatives to classical jobs.\n\nThis is the reason we are now organising an online-summit with multiple topical public listening and discussion sessions on the very topic of \u201cmaking a living\u201d.\n\nSometimes that is very hard. Some people have to do their \u201cgood work\u201d after their job, for others, the financial reality of the \u201cgood work\u201d is not secure, especially during a crisis like this one.\n\nIn one of our conversations about the issue of work during Covid19 [I shared how my friends and my mother's self-worth was tied to work even so they know better.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/work-in-the-time-of-corona-virus/12850/50) Among many understanding and helpful answers was the recommendation to read your book.\n\nI found the reading quite helpful and soon saw a lot more connection to the topics and people on the platform, especially in connection to the summit.\n\nOpen source technology is a big topic for us, we have many ongoing threads of people discussing and developing it. Almost weekly calls and webinars that community members offer for other community members for free. In which we also have been discussing the paradox of something being so wanted and valued, but at the same time, not able to sustain people.\n\nWhen I read Pablo's story about the paradox of paid duct-taping vs unpaid creation tech development in your book I was sure that this was something we needed to discuss further and dig in with our community, many of which are creating these codes for free. And on top of that, we found with our alternative art-and co-creation hub \u201cBlivande\u201d in Stockholm, that [something similar is happening with creation in many many fields](https://forum.blivande.com/t/paid-duct-taping-vs-unpaid-creation/1027). As an artist, I also very much agree with that.\n\nIn the summit we would like to discuss \u201c(H)ow do we make sure that people who supply the world with community, beauty and social innovation get paid without having to sell-out and become duct taping\u201d. And the issues and patterns that are the current hurdles, acute and systemic.\n\nWe would love to have you there as a speaker and design a session with you in it.\n\nWe could offer Edgeryders \u201cscalable ethnography model\u201d, where SSNA allows us to take in and interpret large amounts of personal statements and conversations qualitatively would be a great fit to do more research on the issue of different forms of bullshit jobs and the structures which create them. If you would join us for the summit and we could invite even more people to share and discuss these topics on the platform we could help to uncover patterns and connections to understand why we so many work against the interest of themselves and society as well in bullshit jobs and learn more about where to cut the knot.\n\nThank you very much for your time.\n\nWe hope you got interested in connecting with us and we are available to discuss the next steps at any time,\n\nMaria Kling for Edgeryders", "created_at": "2020-05-09 09:06:38.211694", "updated_at": "2020-05-09 09:23:11.419681", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 782, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 26.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70978, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12232, "post_number": 7, "raw": "[quote=\"trythis, post:6, topic:12232\"]\nIf you read this and have contacts to an organization that might endorse this, or would like to use it to support their regular operations - please get in touch and let us know!\n[/quote]\n\n\nHmmm.

For that, you have to rely on your background, networks or luck.\n\nHow should you know that it is important \"who\" grades your paper rather than how they grade it? How should you know that the internships you make are more important than your thesis in many cases? (Especially if your tutors tell you otherwise when you ask them).\n\nWe came to speak of first-generation academics and especially fist generation women academics during the call. We have all the opportunities, but many of us still grew up with parents and grandparents, especially mothers and grandmothers who told us the \"If I only could have gone to school/university I could have done so much more with my life!\". This created an exception for us to use those opportunities now given to us, but without knowing how to actually do that beyond \"going to school/university\". There are of course many other layers and steps to navigate to develop your cognitive and professional life. And of course, it is absolutely right that university is not universal or even necessarily the best way to develop your abilities, but I think many people grow up with that as the promise of how to move up and end up recognising that they only got half the memo after years of studies when they start to see all of those other layers too late or unattainable.\n\nI know that I thought school and university would be the key things to enable me to leave the dead-end rural area without any cultural offers I grew up in. I know now that even so my studies have to lead me to many interesting thoughts and experiences, I struggled to make any living from them after my Master's degree as I simply did not know how and was not taught how to at university and did not have the background I could have asked. The jobs that enable me to continue my work and explorations have come mainly through the network of friends and peers and the few internships or other \"work-like-experiences\" I gathered more or less by chance. I am learning a lot now after 7 years of study about how I have to build up a lot of skills and a network now which I would have thought to \"get\" through the studies.  I can also see now that expecting that was probably wrong, and as you said @johncoate, studying mainly teaches you critically thinking, not the skills to work in a profession, but how should you know that as a student? The story is, \"study and your life will work out\" (maybe we have to learn to think more critically about that as well;)) and studying is a great part of your life, but it is not the full story and how much of it you hear, or if you even hear that part still very much is connected to your background.\n\nI also know that I complain on a high level here. I am still extremely lucky. I could study for 7 years without giant debts due to student financial support and scholarships provided by the country I happened to be born in. I live a good life in a good place. I have some steady income by now, not much but enough to not feel like a burden on my partner and like what I am doing is at least sustainable enough to continue, however, the middle-class lifestyle we have right now would not be possible for us without his income as mine still only covers the bare minimum. And for me, that is connected to University and the chances it promises, provides or does not, as that was how I was told how to make a life and therefore where I put a lot of my energy in. Growing up I thought that University would be the door through which anyone could straight forward enter into any profession if they only commit themselves enough.

It means that we map technology policy choices onto their real-life consequences, so as to make the debate more inclusive. In this, we are learning from experience: for example, that of the 2014 EU consultation on copyright (again!). A consultation was out, but it was not getting many responses. This was in large part because it consisted of an 80-pages questionnaire, contained in a downloadable MS Word file, written in legalese and only in English. A group of activists translated it into several languages, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 mapped the questions of the questionnaire onto real life experiences. For example: \"if you have had problems sharing videos with your friends in other EU countries, answer question 16\". Unsurprisingly, this jacked up participation by two orders of magnitude, and greatly increased the diversity of responses. Only professional lobbyists, who get paid for it, will fill an 80-pages questionnaire in legalese. But that's wasteful, because lobbyists already have their channels to talk to the EU institutions, and the latter already know what lobbyists think. Consultation are most useful when they reach into the corners of society that normally do not request appointments with the Commission, like \u2013 in this case \u2013 teenagers sharing videos and amateur DJs wondering on the legal consequences of remixing ([more on this](http://www.cottica.net/2014/02/04/copyright-in-the-eu-and-the-dark-side-of-online-consultations/)).\n\n[quote=\"RobvanKranenburg, post:4, topic:10138\"]\nIs in the opinion of edgeryderrs Next Generation Internet a party political project?\n[/quote]\n\nThis sounds like a rhetorical question. However, OK: there is no \"Edgeryders\". Edgeryders does not have opinions. People who post on the Edgeryders platform occasionally do, and we do not police them. We do ask them to abide our [netiquette](/t/45). This position is consistent:\n\n* With the NGI  Forward Grant Agreement. It lists as the first objective of the NGI Forward platform:\n\n> Offer everyone prepared to reflect on NGI and the future Internet more broadly an easy-to-use dynamic platform to do it on, and a diverse, inclusive and dissent-tolerant community to do it with.\n\n* With the EU's core values. Our motto is, not coincidentally, _in varietate concordia_. Dissent does not make us enemies. That is the whole point of uniting a continent where people have butchered each other for 700 years, often over matters of religion and ideology.\n\n[quote=\"RobvanKranenburg, post:4, topic:10138\"]\nTo me it sounds like he is bashing the \u2018centre\u2019 politics in MTV style in his bedroom. All good but should we take this as a serious analysis?\n[/quote]\n\nThe material appearing on the platform is not analysis per se. We treat it as data for collective intelligence, again as per the GA. The point of collective intelligence is that it corrects itself. In the case you mention, what happens is this: the ethnographers coding this particular post might enter codes that make a \"spurious\" correlation, for example `social media` and `CDU` (in practice I doubt this will happen, my understanding of the post is that @MariaEuler and @matthias are remarking on the uneasy relationship between political communication and the architecture of the Internet. Nothing to do the with the CDU).   This will induce an edge between these two codes in the semantic network. As the rest of the corpus is coded, two things might happen:\n\n1. Nowhere else is this connection made. In this case, it is by definition not \"collective intelligence\", but just one person's opinion. It gets discarded in Graphryder, together with the other weak edges. \n1. The connection resurfaces in other corners of the platform, and in different conversations. In this case, several people see it as relevant. We have an empirical regularity. Win! We might then want to go deeper to interpret what it means. We might even learn something about the issue at hand, which is the whole point of the exercise.

It was a nice meeting with a small group of people and the discussions went on and ended up with @karimyassin volunteering to organize a trip to sekem, and discussing the different possibilities of the Reef in an Egyptian context ( @m_tantawy - @mohabessam already started to explore [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/egyptian-reef-part-1-reality-mapping-of-existing-spaces-we-can-co-house-with/7007/4) and [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/potential-track-for-cairo/7023) )   , besides other talks on decentralization and getting outside of Cairo [or not ].  \n\n---\n\nso briefly we were: \n\n@Nashat_3 briefly   an IT entrepreneur, experimenting in Iot with farming, and smart Gardens, He participated in different hackahtons and entrepreneurship training/competitions, Fablab trainings. He is looking to know more like minded people and share more ideas and get feedback from the community. \n\n@M.Elshafey  works on this [carpooling app](https://edgeryders.eu/t/topic/6848/13) and this idea for [building a community in an island](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-community-of-egyptian-creative-youth-on-jiftun-island/6979) \n\n@m_tantawy working on this [open source furniture](https://edgeryders.eu/t/bitcut-open-source-furniture-platform/6999) and [Maerfa cultural project](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maarefa-a-cultural-attempt-in-egypt-self-story/6813)\n\n@karimyassin working on [Cilas](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maarefa-a-cultural-attempt-in-egypt-self-story/6813) an alternative institute for liberal arts and sciences education in Cairo. \n\n@mohabessam a [community architect](https://edgeryders.eu/t/this-just-in/6992/6) participated in [Elzeba](http://www.ezbetproject.com/) project in Egypt and worked on a publication in Germany. \n\nNeveen : she came from Alexandaria, living and working there in the field of cost accounting and import/exports. most of her work is now done online, she wants to move to Cairo as their are more opportunities and in Alexandria most of the work is managed by families. she studied in Sohag, love to draw and thinks Cairo is better place for young initiatives. \n\nAya : Also came from Alexandria, she is doing a masters degree in Anthropology, writing about new technologies and knowledge economy. She used to work as an assistant manager in a company but she quite because here interests were somewhere else, now she is looking forward to get into organizations working in development, she volunteered in different projects. \n\n@Tahra.Tarek  working in the media field, now doing a diploma for cultural awareness, she worked in organizing several lectures in the journalism syndicate and other places, wrote some articles, Joined 8 months ago \"el-Beet\" ( literally the home ) a participatory art space in downtown. they provide several workshops for writers, artists, ....etc on storytelling an other skills.\n\nBesides, \nAssem : fresh engineering graduate, now waiting to join the army, mandatory, and he is part of the fablab community for the past 3-4 years, expert in digital fabrication, now teaching the maker diploma, he likes music and plays oud. \n\n@ahmedhamed  : a multi-media journalist, part of [Aswat Masria](http://en.aswatmasriya.com/) team ( from the early beginning till the end ) , photographer, and filmmaker ( one of his films, [his first work](https://vimeo.com/38177266) ) \n\nAhmed : 21 years old from Cairo, now studies computer science in Sohag, he is passionate about information technology, and organizing thoughts wants to change the way of thinking, routine, and he is a kick boxing player. ( he is also starting an initiative in his university to improve the way of teaching ) \n\nAmira : from Mesaha, now working on an Eco-lodge / farm in Siwa with other friends. and works alternative care. \n\nafter getting to know each other in small groups and then within the large group, discussing the difference between Sohag, Cairo, and Alexandria. we got to discuss and explore the concept of open village and how it could be done in the Egyptian context. We discussed the other living communities, such as Sekem, crafts villages as Tunis in Fayoum, and how they are surviving and got initiated. \n\none interesting example was mentioned by Ahmed Hamed about Evelin in Tunis village, she started as she saw that young girls are getting no education and are experiencing a lot of abuse. so what she did (as a foreigner  ) she didn't start a women rights organization or a campaign against child abuse, she started a crafts school to teach pottery, so this school was a place for the girls to go and get some education, express themselves and it changed a lot of lives, One of which he followed after seeing an old documentary about her as a child, she is Rawia, she has now a big workshop and she told him that this school changed not only her life but other girls as well.( [short documentary about Rawia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN8Gn2D86GY) )  and this raised the question of documenting such success stories and learning from them, and monitoring the impacts of our projects. Ahmed  even thinks that may be one day he can start a film school in a small village and live there. \n\nTantawy mentioned that, there are different initiatives working and struggling already, and we should build a bigger community using the platform and share our experiences. He sees the potential of such a platform and sees it as a chance to useful collaboration instead of competing which is a mentality that is found within some local groups and initiatives.  Also a method to get out of the general depression that is in the air. \n\nAmira explained what is happening [going to happen] In Siwa, this is a solid long term project, where a group of people is going to buy a land in Siwa, already scouted the potential places, and then start building with local methods learning from the existing architecture and farming depending on the available resources. a potential house to be linked in the openvillage network.  she mentioned other far away places where this could happen as El-Qusair. \n\nNeven raised the issue of exporting goods, as the Government is encouraging this with some benefits as tax reduction ? which could generate revenue for such a local place that is well connected globally. \n\nKarim explained the idea of Cilas and how it was formed through different metaphors, and mentioned that some Alumni are discussing  opening a Center in Alexandria. and he is open to replicate the experience in other places as well. \n\nthis was mainly the main topics that we touched upon, and we continue online.", "created_at": "2017-09-13 17:55:50.297327", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 20:15:45.419941", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1114, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 464.4, "like_count": 11, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 3993, 3729, 4, 2095, 3880, 3791, 4088, 3782, 3964], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72790, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12931, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ok guys,\n\ncould you have a look at [Howard's suggestions in this post and peole's comments on it](https://edgeryders.eu/t/is-the-communitarian-internet-back-in-the-wake-of-covid-19-a-conversation-with-howard-rheingold/12971/5) and help adapt the questionnaire above based on it?

Hexi Pharma, a major company selling disinfectants to hospitals all over the country was discovered to have diluted their products even 10 times from the labelled concentration, to the point of causing infections of thousands of patients in the system over the last years (news\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.romania-insider.com/disinfectant-fraud-in-romanian-public-hospitals/\">here</a>).\n\nThis is just scratching the surface and confirms deep system fail: (1) underfunding and horrendous infrastructure making large numbers of young doctors leave - to give you an idea, more Romanian doctors are working in other EU countries (&gt;20K) than in Romania (10-13K) (2) the perverse circle of paying under the counter - there is no way out: if you\u2019re not paying as a patient, you risk not being watched over; if you\u2019re a doctor and refuse the \u201cgift\u201d, you show weakness and worry patients; you\u2019re also a threat for colleagues because you\u2019re messing up with their system. \u00a0\n\nThis post is not a rant about the system, it's to share\u00a03 stories and how they connect with it as much as we like to escape it. Special thanks to @Moushira for contributing questions along the way &lt;3\n\n<strong>First story:</strong> One of my best friend\u2019s brother was diagnosed with testicular cancer. While being made to wait long hours in Romanian hospital hallways, he felt his morale was going down even before embarking on the painful journey that cancer treatment is. Having Hungarian citizenship as well, they immediately chose a clinic in Budapest (also public) - more quiet, and with greater concern for patients wellbeing, both physical and mental. What struck me the\u00a0most is seeing\u00a0my friend driving her brother for 6 hours every other week for many months, repeating this in cycles until the disease receded. Her own time, subjecting him to this tiring ride and random\u00a0B&amp;Bs\u00a0were altogether more desirable choices than putting him through the pains of systemic healthcare.\n\n<strong>Second story: </strong>While I was growing up, my (then) very young parents took grand-grandma in, who had just moved in from the countryside as she had no one left there. She helped my parents a great deal as they were both working and raising me and my sister. She would cook, take us to the kindergarten, contribute her pension to domestic expenses too, so that, in her words, she would not be too much of a burden on the family. When she fell very ill my grandma (her daughter) took her in, cared for her in ways some would say only professional help should care for a patient, and finally she went.. in a familiar bed. So here you have, like in the <a href=\"/en/befragung\">story</a> reported by @HoneyMk family shouldering the full burden of care. You also have, like @steelweaver \u00a0mentioned, <a href=\"/t/community-acupuncture-an-ongoing-mutation/638\">humane treatment</a>.\n\nFast forward twenty something years, and my widower grandma now, too, lives with my parents. This kind of housing arrangement is common practice, as private home cares cost at least twice\u00a0a pension. And while there is perceived duty from children to care for their elderly, I\u2019m convinced this is not the way, I see now\u00a0how much\u00a0my\u00a0big family picture (idealized!) has\u00a0changed. It is a solution that comes from the need to avoid alienation coupled with saving costs for both sides. My grandma\u2019s rental apartment provides half a salary more and helps my folks support themselves - up until now, my dad was unemployed for the past 4 years. So this is a barter with love, but with too much daily pressure and more to come - my parents are still young (50yrs old) and my grandma\u2019s health is only getting worse. So it can\u2019t be that a generation later, the solutions are still so archaic. \u00a0\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3ab79df0-ecc6-5dfd-bd1a-7e9c98aa4c11\">We make these long term investments in relationships and stand ready to pay our dues when\u00a0time\u00a0comes - in love, care, financial support, anything that we can. </b>\n\n<b>What if my friend's brother could have waited differently, learning something with\u00a0other patients in the first hospital?</b>\n\n<b>What if my grandma had serious\u00a0help in caring for her mother, at home so she could still feel a good daughter? </b>\n\n<b>What if my parents don't have to psychologically prepare for their future where their daughters won't be able to care for them (my sis lives abroad, and I have never had a job)?\u00a0but maybe\u00a0could save a little money at a time and put them in a collective pot, like a trusted\u00a0health insurance?\u00a0</b>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3ab79df0-ecc6-5dfd-bd1a-7e9c98aa4c11\">What if people would be willing to make proper\u00a0care investments?</b>\n\nWell, there is one dramatic, yet telling story of\u00a0crisis-born solutions (and\u00a0effective\u00a0partly\u00a0because of that).\n\n<strong>Third story:</strong>\u00a0Starting 2009, Romania became the EU country with the cheapest drugs, which screwed up pricing arrangements - it made providers offer small prices to the state agency purchasing and distributing drugs to medical\u00a0institutions; the profit margin was so low that they stopped producing, especially cancer drugs; the regulations were so weak that there was no punishment for breaking contracts. This left hospitals all over with serious shortages of essentially cheap cytostatics. An <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/romanias-underground-cancer-drug-networks/272692/\">underground support network</a> was created by young economist Vlad Voiculescu living in Vienna at the time. Vlad was seeing desperate calls for help from home and offered to buy the drugs from pharmacies in Austria and in Hungary, flying them in by himself or through friends, acquaintances and, as the network grew, helpful strangers or tourists. The delivery chain ended up including even taxi drivers as intermediaries dropping off drugs at patients\u2019 homes and picking up the cash. All this was aided by the <a href=\"http://medicamente-lipsa.ro/\">online community platform</a> set up where people would report shortages, and led to strong, media-supported advocacy which eventually improved the supplies.\n\nI would ask Vlad to join and tell us the whole story, but I know he is busy. As of this week he is the newest Romanian Ministry of Health, in a situation where grassroots meets hope for system change.\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/HtrmVQMUXnw\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-26 11:33:29", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 12:13:27.835832", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1215, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 63.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53542, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 15, "raw": "[quote=\"johncoate, post:14, topic:9881\"]\nSome of my experience is with nonprofit and other small organizations who are not well funded and go for open source software to save money\n[/quote]\n\nOpen Source (for humans) - in my opinion - is not about saving anyones money.

Using AI / deep learning for this would be quite experimental (while surely interesting :slight_smile:). But you gave me another idea: we could add one or more fields to the user profile that only community builders can fill and see. Such as: interests, projects / goals, skills etc.. That helps to create a \"collective brain\" from all of the observations and pieces of knowledge that our staff members have about community members, allowing the manual matching with larger numbers of users.\n\n[quote=\"zmorda, post:1, topic:9343\"]It is preferable to integrate an API that translates the content[/quote]\n\nAgreed.

But, for example I wouldn't put the RezNet (nor the EarthOS, cc @andreja) under \"projects\". Can we think of separate \"tabs\" for each Unit? The Culture Squad already has its funnel website and its \"tab\" could lead to this: https://culturesquad.org/ (currently not working for me though cc @noemi). \n\nI was thinking of something similar for RezNet in which we explain what can we do for a potential partner and how it works on the examples of previous (OpenCare) and ongoing (Poprebel, NGI) projects. This is what interests the consortia - to answer their question: how can this work for my project idea? What are the results we can get? It can be done by showing graphryder and/or linking to the posts on the platform explaining results and processes.

We feared for loved ones, and for the long-term freedom and prosperity of our societies. We felt powerless, and anxious in the face of uncertainty. We still do.\n\nBut, at some point along the way, we realized there was something we could do. We have in our midst a team of data scientists. When the pandemic hit, Kristof and Michal were analysing trends in the evolution of Internet technology. Theirs is a big data method: they do text analysis on large repositories of academic papers, news articles, social media. We realized we could use the same method to investigate the virus and its companion illness. It would be like redirecting our searchlight onto a new target.\n\n**So we did that. In the space of only a few weeks, Kristof and Michal came back with results, neatly arranged in [an interactive website ](https://covid.delabapps.eu/). And that\u2019s where we need your help.**\n\n*Here\u2019s the thing: this type of analysis scales well, but its results are not easy to interpret. We can see, for example, that technologies associated with the pandemic fall into four groups: remote work, medical, social distancing, contact tracing. This makes sense at first sight, but what does it mean? That people are using these technologies a lot? That researchers are working to improve these technologies over others? Or is the result an artifact of the way we look at the data? Is there a way that we can determine if there are obvious gaps in our technological arsenal? If we found any, we could look into investing to plug them.*\n\nThis type of analysis becomes much more actionable when you provide context to it. As I pored over early results, I could not help notice a positive sentiment for [PEPP-PT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_Privacy-Preserving_Proximity_Tracing). Except that, in the very same days, the PEPP-PT consortium had collapsed due to the withdrawal of several research institutes over privacy concerns. Before the collapse, I might have interpreted the positive sentiment as validation. \u201cLook, the tech community likes this protocol!\u201d. In the light of the collapse, it made more sense to read it as na\u00efve enthusiasm, or even spin. A possible interpretation could be: \u201cit is a good idea to let the community poke holes in any specific solution before we endorse it\u201d. Another one is: \u201cscientists and engineers are still humans. In a crisis, they reach for a solution, and want it to work. Their critical abilities are, for a time, weakened.\u201d\n\nIn sum, we have a large trove of data on COVID-19, which seems to hold important knowledge, if we could just unlock it. So, we propose an experiment. Let\u2019s get together (online), and question the data. Let\u2019s look at them, turn them around in our heads, interrogate each other on their possible meaning. Let\u2019s formulate hypoteses, and see if we can think of ways to test them. Kristof and Michal can transform them into queries and visualization in real time, or close enough. In other words, let\u2019s augment big data analysis with collective intelligence methods. It will be a way for us to learn more about both COVID-19 and this particular big data methodology.\n\n# When:\n## 3rd of June, 5 PM CEST.\n\n# How to join:\n**Follow this link to sign up:**\n## https://zmurl.com/ngicovid\n#\n\n**We will record this webinar for research purposes.

Usually ancient Greek or Roman texts in translation. Or texts from the Babylonian cuneiform tablets. I start by reading and reading and reading. Starting to see where there are overlaps: Where an icon from one culture appears in another, or where a similar story thread is echoed in another. It's a bit like tracing the roots of language (a language of mythology)\nI have this view that in the modern Western world we treat ancient myths and stories like we treat the stories in texts like the Bible. We say \"this probably didn't happen exactly as written, but we believe that these people were based on real people\".\nI now believe that this isn't true of the ancient myths.\nI think that most of the oldest myths actually tell completely fictional stories that are drawn from celestial events (at least at their very beginning)\nIs it likely that a man called Hercules existed and performed a series of tasks that made him renowned all over the ancient Mediterranean? Maybe... Until you realise there's a similar story that predates Herakles by about 800 years based on ancient Akkadian god myths. Then you find out that in this other myth the God is question is the Sun God, who travels around the globe and undertakes 13 tasks (one for each constellation of the Mesopotamian Zodiac)\nSuddenly it seems much more likely that this is a metaphorical story that explains early celestial patterns.\n\nAnyway, that's a small insight into the beginnings of the research process. After that i start by writing out the bare bones of the myths across all of the cultures (where parts are identical, where there is a different, special flavour) Finally i work out what story i want to tell. Trying to iron out the problematic parts of ancient stories that i think do not deserve to be carried forward (mostly the rape) Finding more imaginative ways around sexual violence.\n\nOnce i have a basic story thread i start to think about how it may work in performance. But for now i'll hold off on the full explanation of that area... :grinning:", "created_at": "2018-02-08 14:01:00.499736", "updated_at": "2018-02-08 14:01:00.499736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 367, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 9.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41285], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72003, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12920, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n![edge%20response%20covid19-01|690x236](upload://g49gF7nou7ZHkr8h6xXj72EsjJ9.png) \n[date=2020-03-23 time=17:00:00 timezone=\"Europe/Stockholm\" timezones=\"Europe/Brussels\" recurring=\"1.weeks\"]\n\n**Dear Community,**\n\n**While we are forced to keep a physical distance to each other we want to come together regularly to discuss our and your challenges, plans and responses.**\n\nAs the Edgeryders team, we want to find ways to help our community and beyond to get through this crisis.\n\nTherefore we now open our weekly team calls for the whole community to join in and give us their ideas and feedback.

After my recent wild \\#LOTE3 experience and a first acquaintance with Matera, I thought: wait a minute, Matera is a universe.\n\n(picked up this word from <a href=\"http://www.dieasta.dk/\">Asta</a> who is based in my hood and other cool <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling\">transmedia</a> people&amp;storytellers, and Matera is exactly it. I'll be referring to this crowd later, and if anyone who reads this post knows any of them, then invite them for a coffee)\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, I found out that and I think it can be quite handy. I'm probably not the only one overwhelmed with all this ideas of what one can do in Matera, in the unMonastery and beyond and what kind of cool stuff we can build together with Materani. My question is how it all connects together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the universe things, processes, people, and all sorts of stuff are connected because they are it's elements. Sometimes different elements of the universe have elements of each other within. To make a long story short: like Marvel. It can be comic albums, and movies, and brands, and games (video games or just RL games), objects or lifestyle - whatever. But not really whatever, because it is not a random mix, it's a universe.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, my attempt to make a story short has sort of failed.\u00a0\n\nI tell you what: I spoke to Giuseppe, and he wants to make a photo-book. Because I can't read properly, I first read his message on hangouts as photo-booth, and thought: it's kinda cool, I want a booth, it can be a rebirth of an unConfession booth with audio recording features.\u00a0\n\nAntoinietta who welcomed me, served royal breakfasts and entertained with conversations on education and languages, had an idea that it will be cool to make a fiction movie about Matera. Not just use the landscape and say it's something else, but about and by someone who is in Matera. She's hanging out with local students and can be one of the Matera-to-unMonks connectors. Adil started cooking up something with internet radio. Bembo, as far as I understood, is infiltrating a theatre crowd and it might grow into some special thing. And so on.\u00a0 I obviously don't know of everything what's happening. (It is actually doesn't matter who does what as long as it is happening.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll these individuals interact. So, if all this, and/or something else is happening in Matera and even better, if possible projects include elements and signs of each other the universe is expanding. It is indeed fun to be in this kind of universe, because something is constantly going on, but at the same nouns head explodes from trying to grasp it all at once.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, I will continue thinking of all this as a universe (because that's what it is), feel free to join in if all what I just wrote makes sense. If it doesn't,\u00a0 I'll be back anyway telling everyone about Matera Universe.\n\n\u200b\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-12 23:03:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.590426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 815, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12835, "user_id": 3417, "topic_id": 526, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I think perhaps there are other people more qualified by me to answer this: those involved in places where they have already set up such mechanisms like the people in the city of Corke and many others outside the EU borders.

Because we think a strong community is a valuable multipurpose tool that each member can use to forward her purposes. By community we did Mission: Baltic, the unMonastery and other good things.\n\nIn a community, you need to put some of your own skin in the game whenever you engage. We want to hear from YOU. We have access to the Internet too, and each of us has her own pet resources: it is great that you think Peeragogy is an important concept and you want to share it with us, but copy/paste does not signal your enthusiasm. Anyone, even a spambot, can do copy/paste. If you want to tell us you like Peeragogy, take the time to write what it is you like about it (and, by all means, include a link): you will make a much greater impression.

In order to get something done in a short time in the house we need to know what people want to work on, how to move their project forward and a concrete thing that can realistically be achieved in a short time together, how to build them (ideally ideas and specifications or instructables), what materials and or tools are needed and if what we can get locally or need to bring with us from abroad.. etc. Having this information will then we also know how big a house we need and for how long. \n\nWe have a process for going from a fuzzy challenge or idea, to a working prototype of a useful/meaningful project - here's a visualisat that @susa and I made some time ago:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/304be5f76b02db7327404fd6e589ad64c571896d.jpg\" width=\"689\" height=\"488\">\n\n\nSo what does this mean for how we work?\n\nYou meet someone local who wants to do something in their village/town/city.

Anyway, as I am digging into the call and trying to find out the people behind it, I also have an idea about whom to engage - and I think they are just the ideal fit for us - it's Tvind, the school that Piotr works for. They exist since the 70-ties and they do alternative global education. They have schools in Denmark, and a big center in Mozambique and they basically send their students to travel and do case studies in developing countries instead of just being in school and getting only theoretical knowledge.\n\nHere are the links to the <a href=\"http://www.tvind.dk/\">school\u00a0</a>. There is one thing I am worried about is the article about them on<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tvind\"> Wikipedia</a> - even though I do think these guys are doing amazing job, there were always some attempts to close the place (they started the renewable energy revolution in Denmark in the 70-ties, leading to closing of the plans to build nuclear plants, etc - so they're basically a bunch of hippies who don't like the system). I wonder if EU would be up for funding us in cooperation with them. Just a hint.\n\nAnother organisation that I really like and they're my friends is a small architect atelier/group. They have done some work going to South America and Asia building affordable houses and so on - they're called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/atelierMade/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts\">Atelier Made</a>, and they work in the north of France (I almost got them to talk on LOTE5 but they were too busy). One of them lives in \u00a0Brussels.\u00a0\n\nA couple of ideas then - and will get back to you asap with the information, I hope (the stuff seems to be well hidden on their website:))\n\nBtw, Nadia, you should listen to Thundercat if you love the Internet ;) I really liked them.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-15 07:27:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.755148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 386, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10473, "user_id": 116, "topic_id": 2445, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>telecom</b>\n\nyes pls. lets try.\n\ngood new, my visit to rome is changing..so probably not tuesday..but twill happen during the week. anycase good to do it monday. lets keep it short and focused.\n\nso many can listen and get it as an useful conversation.\n\ntopic. give me a preliminary idea about what we could do for telecom considering\n\n1. scenarios things\u00a0\n\n2. specific topics linked to telecom (secutiry, money, finance, web things ) and CSR -pls remmeber our first talk is to a CSR event/communication person\n\n3. i discoverd that their content of Expo 2015 its still empy..so we may even try to link the development of our proposal towards expo..but lets do also something easier and shorted in advance\n\n\u00a0\n\nthank\n\nmy skype is\n\nsimonedebattisti\n\nor hangout simone.debattisti@gmail.com\n\n\u00a0\n\ni ll be on mobile so pls anyone of you organise the group call\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-02 15:25:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:00.188259", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 182, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43093, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 8342, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2018-03-22 12:30:18.808549", "updated_at": "2018-03-22 12:30:18.808549", "deleted_at": "2018-03-22 12:44:01.980175", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48949, "user_id": 3706, "topic_id": 9194, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Thank you so much Alberto!

In my experience some key ones are:\n\n- that you have good work with a clear purpose and that the values and vision of the organisation are coherent and alive;\n- that people are able to work together and sort out differences;\n- that the resources are sufficient - there are enough coming in to support the work that needs to take place.\n\nFinancial sustainability has remained a persistent task for GalGael, as it is for many organisations. This was a particular challenge during August and mostly likely for some months to come. It\u2019s an issue that regularly features in posts on the Edgeryders platform and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty of experience to share at the [Edge of Funding](/t/id/6427) panel planned for OpenVillage.\n\nSupporting the development of program content and other curating work has been welcome respite from these challenges. The fellowship itself affords a bit of time to step back and consider the \u2018less urgent\u2019 things about the work. Being caught up in the \u2018urgent stuff\u2019 as we so often are in smaller organisations and groups is the space of burnout. We become sucked in to a relentless pattern of activity to secure our survival or just because there are too few people to cover all that needs done. Other forms of organisational and personal sustainability seem less important and while time management tools encourage us to move out of the \u2018urgent quadrant\u2019 and spend more time on the important aspects of our work, the reality of achieving this can feel perversely elusive.\n\nThe three original themes [have been blended](/t/id/6632) for Open Village program to reflect the overlap and interconnection. The fellowship allows me to continue following the thread of the Architectures of Love theme \u2013 I\u2019m still curious about where it might lead and what it might reveal. I guess that curiosity stems from a sense of something \u2018important\u2019 happening out of the corner of my eye and while all my attention is consumed with numbers, spreadsheets and plans \u2013 I\u2019ve never had much chance to give this my full attention. I\u2019m curious to see what would be revealed if we paid more attention to creating the conditions to bring about desired outcomes - such as health in our organisations - rather than see these as \u2018outputs\u2019 of our clever plans and policies?\n\nMargaret Wheatley and Deborah Frieze\u2019s book [Walk Out Walk On](http://walkoutwalkon.net/) describes the principle of \u2018start anywhere, follow it everywhere\u2019. In a world of constant flux it seems like a useful approach and one which they describe as generating changes in education, public safety, arts, ecology and food in Joubert Park in Johannesburg. They make the point that this is a more productive approach than forms of social change dependent on assumptions that large and complex issues must be addressed one by one, with institutions and experts who specialise in that particular problem.\n\nSo in \u2018following it everywhere\u2019 I\u2019m continuing to look for insights on this topic through conversations, books and reading posts that will help to flesh out the list of \u2018enabling factors\u2019 for Opencare/citizen led care suggested [early on in the fellowship](/t/id/6429/12):\n \n* The skills, forms of awareness, competences, knowledge and practices of individuals\n* The designed environment, including public spaces and communal spaces\n* Values and a culture of care\n* The designed opportunities for interaction, engagement, collaboration\n* Commons of all kinds, material sufficiency\n\nOne pattern I\u2019ve noticed is the role that language and assumptions play in either creating or shutting down the interior and exterior spaces within us and between us. Both language and assumptions influence all of the factors listed. The language we use is in direct relationship with our assumptions.  The words we choose can give away the assumptions we are operating from while at the same time shaping our perceptions. In Ivan Illich\u2019s words; \u201cthe present is built on assumptions we haven\u2019t yet found names for.\u201d - they shape our sense of self and others and inform our worldview. They subtly contribute to or degrade the conditions we create. A perspective reinforced by [Abeba Birhane\u2019s](https://edgeryders.eu/t/abeba-birhane-cognitive-science-dialogism-and-care/6893) tweet quoting Bakhtin; \u201cThe deepest layers of our assumptive world are probably those where we unreflectingly conceive the nature of time and space\u201d. Assumptions are the hidden architecture but they impact the world around us in ways that are very real.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/00945b05c075888e5fa0b30e71c21f9886f8e59c.png\" width=\"345\" height=\"268\">\n\nIn the Right to Useful Unemployment, Illich describes \u201clanguage as the most fundamental of commons\u201d \u2013 a commons that perhaps requires more of our attention. Like other commons many terms and words have themselves become enclosed or hijacked; \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018resilience\u2019 and \u2018empowerment\u2019 are all cases in point. There are many more we could list that have been co-opted for certain agendas. Some words are simply \u2018hollowed out\u2019 \u2013 words that through mis-use and over extraction lose value and meaning.\n\nWithin the care sector, language subtly defines relationships and power. To reference Illich again; \u201clanguage is about the organisation of power\u201d. Language use informs relationships that either confer agency or create dependency. Perhaps our use of language is the first condition that creates either \u2018power with\u2019 or \u2018power over\u2019 - something to consider in our care services? \n\nThere are clear possibilities that could arise from working consciously with these factors. I\u2019d be curious to hear from others who have intentionally worked with the soft structures that shape our world. My hunch is that this could dramatically increase the scope for radically innovative work that isn\u2019t merely badging new developments with a hollowed out word.", "created_at": "2017-09-05 18:11:30.199650", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:31:44.742723", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 960, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 173.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [854, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5513, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5480, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The European Commission is out to promote a more sophisticated awareness of the interdependencies between the EU and the rest of the world.

It was part of this [XPRIZE](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/global-learning) competition and targeted East Africa. \n   While researching such initiatives, we found that there exists great apps already, but that very few target developing countries. Though smartphones are increasingly common in Africa, there are many hinders for families to start using existing games due to some main factors:\n- the apps are large and require online connection\n- complicated sign up/in processes --> high threshold to start learning.\n- no local adaption of the content\n\nOur solution is a platform and aggregator for learning games, where we team up with content partners such as [Cognition Matters](https://cognitionmatters.org/) and adapt their games to fit our target audience.\nSince we strongly believe in communities and co-creation we've made the platform open source and our vision is to build a flourishing community that translates and adapts the app to more languages and cultures. Most edtech companies target schools, but since the school system is a centralized system for learning it also easily becomes a bottle neck and resources don't reach students as fast as they could do. Therefore we target parents directly and see ourselves as a complement to school.\n\nLet me know if this sounds interesting to you or if you know someone suitable!\nWith love,\nJohanna", "created_at": "2020-06-10 19:16:50.882050", "updated_at": "2020-06-10 19:16:50.882050", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 320, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 219.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4, 8, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45246, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7394, "post_number": 36, "raw": "Submitted as an expense.

Throughout the pandemic this has been highlighted with everyone forced to work remotely. From the UK to the US it seems to be an issue. While, some governments have built infrastructure that supports digital work in cities and neglected rural areas, the divide crosses the class system and geographical location.*  \n\n## Digital Poverty\n\n\u201cI'm interested in the possibilities for coworking in particularly in rural areas. And it's got me thinking a lot about technological challenges for remote rural areas, which is something that some of my colleagues are working on in the context broadly of digital poverty\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sense that I've got is that setting up rural coworking has a particular set of challenges in terms of identifying who to bring together, finding the space appropriate to bring people together. But there's an infrastructural problem which often relies on national infrastructure providers, unless there's a particular set of expertise within that small rural community that can provide the infrastructure for themselves.\u201d\n\n## Access to Broadband and WiFi\n\n\u201cWe have been spoiled in Iran, we have great internet access pretty much everywhere, even in some of the rural areas. 4G also works really well. It's very stable unless you really have a large, big amount of data or video conferencing or files that are emailed, etc. that works really well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there's that other project by Elon Musk. We never know what's going to happen, but he's spreading out a network of satellites, to give internet access to pretty much the whole world, anywhere. I read an interview where he said he didn't really know if it was going to be successful or not, but considering his other success, I want to believe that that's going to happen maybe in five years time.\u201d\n\n## Large interest in more rural locations\n\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of people coming, asking us to move away from the main towns in our region and go to smaller rural towns.For us to do that and go purchase or build or rent a premises or whatever, it's just not feasible or possible for us.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo what we say to people is, if you can find local stakeholders and developers and people with an interest in doing something for their community. So you're talking real kind of stakeholder driven, purpose driven type, initiation of a coworking or a hope project or something in a local town. If you can find something like that and get a space and are willing to give you three, six months rent free and give you a discount thereafter in order to help out their local town or local, and then bring people together.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople from Facebook and Google and different people living in these rural towns are happy to collaborate and work on these projects and then maybe get involved on the board and help out and help run them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had some inquiries pre COVID; post COVID, we've got, 500% more inquiries from people who all of a sudden are working remotely and realising they don't want to go back to the office or drive back into the city, but  don't want to stay working at home, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will bring all the expertise and access to a much bigger network to that to make it more appeasable or professional or whatever it is you want to call it. So now even the bigger companies can look at it and say,\u2019 Oh, that's connected into a local network or a national network.\u2019\u201d\n\n## Digital divide based on geographical location\n\n\u201cIn California there was a strong feeling about the digital divide and that, we should do more to help the rural infrastructure so that everybody can be connected. Then\u2026 things started to shift where the feeling was, well, if you want to live in the country, that's fine but you know, the infrastructure is going to be in the city. Everybody needs to live in the cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the San Francisco Bay area, the energy just kept getting concentrated more and more into the cities. And those of us out here in the country - there are some remote workers out here who need to pay a lot for specifically high bandwidth. I'm essentially using a cable modem and it works well enough, but just not very far down this road, nobody has any access at all. So that's how it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the shift that I'm seeing since COVID is now\u2026 that we've got to build out the infrastructure out into the countryside, because it seems like possibly a really unhealthy thing in the future for everybody to be all closely packed together.\u201d \n...\n## If you feel strongly about any of the issues above, or have any first hand experiences or solutions you would like to share with us, please comment below!\n\n*This summary is from an event was part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

You can write a post about it, but you have no certainty that people have read it. You can write it in your profile, but again people might not visit your profile page. Even if you call your user \"HELLOIAMANANTHROPOLOGIST\" people have an amazing ability to ignore relevant info.\n\nOn the other hand, Edgeryders is clearly characterized as a space for research and collective intelligence, and people need to go through an ethical consent funnel before they post\n[/quote]\n\n\nIn my view, the ethical consent funnel is like the process I go through when I'm interviewing people -- I send a participant information sheet explaining the research and the protections involved, get their consent, and continue. But again this is one of those ethical questions that's ongoing even in offline research: when you're doing participant-observation, you're not going to be running around the city with a sign taped to your back saying I'M AN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCHER. But when you're doing an interview with someone where you could be getting information that, should they be identifiable, could potentially harm them, your ethical commitments are different. More explicit disclosure is necessary. \n\nMost of the time, the ethical procedures required by the university are both too stringent and not stringent enough. Better to have a more robust ethical code that you can assess case by case rather than blanket DO THIS/DON'T DO THAT rules --- it's relatively easy to know when something might be harmful, whether it's out on an online forum or said over a drink. Use your human being common sense, and err on the side of protection. The point is that you as a researcher have ethical commitments, in my view, and those commitments shouldn't be hidden. They should be easily discoverable (whether in post form, through an ethical consent funnel, whatever). And above all you shouldn't be using deception unless you have an extremely compelling reason to do so (not just, 'people are more likely to talk to me if they don't know I'm a researcher'). \n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:7, topic:9005\"]\nthink it raises another ethical issue as to whether the ethnographer participates but shouldn't try to influence the conversation, either consciously or subconsciously, based on whatever biases that person brings to the conversation.\n[/quote]\n\nThe trick here, I think, is to a) realise that there is no contribution free of 'bias' (e.g. there is no view from nowhere-- every intervention you make comes from a place). The goal is to be as reflexive as possible about what that place is. And part of the goal of social research is to tease out things that are of interest to the researcher (whether that researcher is doing, say, an independent project on smart cities, or is doing a H2020 project on populism). For example, it seems clearly beneficial to the research to stop the conversation from becoming about daisy-growing --- but where the skill comes in is being trained enough to know when the conversation about daisy-growing actually IS about populism. \n\nF/e, in Open Care we'd get some really generic posts about happiness. A CM like Noemi might step in and say-- hey, could you tell us specifically what you do? Who you do it with? What kinds of futures you'd like to see? In this way she's acting like an ethnographer--- teasing out the specifics and asking people to think more deeply. She's guiding the conversation, but she's still asking for this person's thoughts and opinions from their own perspective. She's not saying \"We think care is X, do you agree?\" for example, because that really restricts the person's ability to respond freely. There are a lot of nuances to it. \n\nLater on in the research, though,  it might actually be useful to test the social theory you've come up with (this is the part of ethnography that stresses not just theorising about people up in your tower, publishing it, and moving on to the next project). So in Open Care, I might ask everyone in the community: hey, I think from what you all have been collectively articulating in various forms, care is more about bringing people together than inventing a technological fix: I think you're saying that people are the best technology. Is this accurate or am I coming out of left field? And then people can engage in meaningful conversation around that theory before you run off and publish it.", "created_at": "2018-09-07 05:05:18.227038", "updated_at": "2018-09-07 05:06:52.448942", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 775, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 57.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [47138, 47143], "is_reply_to": [47138, 47143], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16489, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6021, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I invited Olga here, lets see what she says. she will use a public space, already found a suitable one, but from what i understood she doesn't want\u00a0to do it in elderly home - this is for independently living individuals rather at this stage, who need a hangout space.\u00a0\n\nI am frustrated enough editing articles on the mobile and ipad;) but maybe i can find a pic, if not, will do it when i am back ib Europe\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-09 23:06:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.378268", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 85, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33968, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 6543, "post_number": 36, "raw": "so it seems that we have a good combination, a beautiful coastal small town near a bigger city.... looking good.

Then the function of the website is to relate the findings of the array of sensors and to allow remote control of electronic devices in the space, for example you could have a temperature notification warning sent to the participants so that a person goes to intervene, or in a more complex set up, you could have a motor listening to the answer from the same temperature sensor and use it to trigger a relay switch, and later a motor, which opens a window to create ventilation. Perhaps a float switch in a water tank can trigger pumps to refill a growing bed. The ambition is to have an early warning system that provokes response to avoid critical failures (eg a really hot day with no windows opened) or ideally a system which then takes a given action itself.\nBy having multiple sites, you could observe the various spaces, then 'put out fires' as you notice that a given community's space is falling into disarray.\nSo I see the use as being something that supplements and adds a structure to the workflow in an existing space. Some people need help regimenting the habits of a garden, so the frontend of the website and relationship to it, interactivity and shared responsibility of the users can form a community.\nSo to go back to the question, I see the workflow as being a group of people which use a communal tool which reminds them of the scheduling of when to plant, when to harvest, forms a space for them to share and delegate the tasks, has the facility for people to join, then all the while can do things to influence the outcome of the produce.\nWe're far from the point of being able to automate it all on a budget, but today we could make an affordable system and platform, which, with the right implementation, could then serve as a vehicle which allows people to take inexperienced gardeners, give them an apprenticeship of sorts with a system that'd help them to learn, not to make the bigger of the mistakes gardening wise and hopefully end up closer to self sufficient.", "created_at": "2017-08-18 12:15:26.577278", "updated_at": "2017-08-18 12:15:26.577278", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 460, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 50.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34476], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77413, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13402, "post_number": 19, "raw": "I have no idea..  :-(", "created_at": "2020-05-26 09:40:39.161831", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 09:40:39.161831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76926], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59621, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10765, "post_number": 19, "raw": "yes but the praxis tells you it is about practical experimentation and learning.

A festival that is happening in many different locations at the same time. \n\nThe festival is presented as a co-created event. The tickets do not cost any money, but they can only be secured by people who contribute towards making it a meaningful, pleasant experience. \n\nFor example, if someone is good at writing - they can help participants to collaboratively produce nice articles sharing what was exchanged or learned in a creative way. If someone is a good cook, they can offer to bring some nice food with them - or even better, to lead the process of people preparing a nice lunch together during the event. \n\nSomeone else might be good at typing fast, they can help to take good notes from the discussion. \n\nWhen people fill in the form, they let us know what their location is so we know which event to connect them with. \n\nThe rest of the registration form is designed to help us match people with the right tasks and events. \n\nBy answering questions in the form, people give us an idea about what they might enjoy or be willing to contribute to the practical organisation of the event. All the responses to the questions in the form are posted on the platform. The edgeryders community managers then draw the attention of the event organisers,  yourself,  to the people who have registered to the festival and are located in Poland. So you can get in touch and discuss with each individual who wishes to participate.\n\nOnce the event organiser and paticipants agree on a task, the participant makes a commitment to their fellow participants of what they will do and they get get a ticket to the event sent to them by email. \n\nThe process might sound complicated but I think it is easier if you can test the process yourself.\n\nYou can see the English version of the website here _(this is not complete and we are still updating the content, it is best to use a computer to view it as as it will only be ready for viewing with a mobile phone in a few days)_: \n\nhttps://festival.edgeryders.eu", "created_at": "2019-09-30 14:32:18.356093", "updated_at": "2019-09-30 14:32:18.356093", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 445, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [60164], "is_reply_to": [60164], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59817, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 10825, "post_number": 15, "raw": "The forms are online now - and buttons link to the above sections.

Also, there was a lot of preparation needed before to find mentors etc- which I did not have time to do.\n\nI wanted to see what others are building, get a sense of how we need to position the work we are and have been doing and build new collaborations to move forward.\n\nFor me the big win was meeting @rowenahen and @Tuukka as well as getting to hang out with @felix.wolfsteller. Also quickly ran into @chiara.certoma : )\n\nRowena is doing a number of really interesting things around remote working and distributed collaboration. She was there generously helping several projects and I very much appreciate her having taken the time to video chat and bounce ideas, share helpful advice and offer to connect us with several people and organisations. You can learn more about here work [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowena-hennigan/).\n\nTuukka 's company builds with community software and they are exploring local economies/local currencies in context of community value creation. He was telling me about their work helping a village in Italy that is suffering the big financial consequences of their food and art festivals being cancelled. Check out their work [here](https://www.mesensei.com/communitydesign).\n\n### Lessons learned\n\n* If you are there \u201calone\u201d, put up a description of you project with the results you already have waay before the submission deadline, first thing that you do, so that you are sure to meet the deadline. For me at least the fast pace does not work well with actually working on stuff - like design or coding. Also, I do not feel it is a healthy way to work, glued in front of a screen for 3 days - especially not now that we are doing this so much in our everyday lives.\n* Use your own introduction to test how your project description resonates with others - if people show up and want to work on it, you may have something worthwhile - if not, maybe go back to the drawing table or think about how you can better frame your work so it fits the context. It is there that you link people to your project description.\n* The slack channels called  *brainmarket*  and *Introduce yourself* are good channels to find and connect with people who have profiles which can be helpful for your project.\n\nBig thanks to @owen who got the app demo up in time for us to submit!

At the top of our visibility, we managed a global community of hundreds of thousands of people. Behind the scene, there was a big (very big) editorial effort. But I have to admit that everything was meant to go on TV, RADIO, Web, offline, in a different format (long-form, ads, transmedia bi-directional interaction and so on...). But this is not the case.  \nI think it is impossible to not consider a big editorial work and a big effort in building and creating the community you want. I mean, it's also something you know very well so I teach you nothing. Communities don't born spontaneously especially now that the \"distractions\" are so much and the offer is huge. \n\nI follow Nadia in the approach. So, first thing first: \n1. Let's start to define the community we are looking for (who are they, where they live, what values they trust, etc..). \n2. Then we understand why this community is called and what is called to do. \n3. Then we build and launch a campaign to engage them using some stories that we need to create attractive and cool enough to distinguish ourself from the noise the world is producing. \n\nAnd this is the simple part.\n\nThe difficult part is to convince them to work on something knowing that only 20% of the people we bring aboard, will be active contributors. So, for sure, the content we use as \"hook\" must be super cool and focused on the right purpose and shared to the right audience. \nWith this I am not saying what you're proposing is wrong, I am actually saying the opposite: what you are proposing is so important that the work we must do anyway to transform the stories that you/we came across is probably the most important one. So, once we know all the things I mentioned before, we need a method. The best method I know when we lack in resources (people and money) is to decide what story is the best to tell, then collect all the material we find without thinking to a distribution channel and then create, build and rebuild the content for all the possible channel/purpose we might need: eg. a long article, a video, an ad, an interview, a webinar, a book and so on...\n\nSorry for the long reply.", "created_at": "2020-04-21 22:18:20.531525", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 22:18:20.531525", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 470, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 43.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44171, "user_id": 4357, "topic_id": 8507, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Let me place here my 2cents ideas (I do hope it's more valuable for you than that)\n\nI guess if back-health issues was main problem last century, burnout is the new problem this century (even if it's not yet finished and I realize soon it could be, with the AI and machines, a \"bore-out\" issues (\"what I'm useful for now, as machines replaced me).\n\nThe main problem is simple, from school (even as a baby/child), we are not prepared to face any situation that could lead in burnout. I don't know how's school new system, but with all the \"homework\" and the \"put all this in your head and try to see if it percolates\", the emphasis is more on the quantity (learn all, master all, be a machine!) than the quality (\"I don't like 70% of the topics, I love litterature > ok, then just learn the basics of all and dive deep in litterature)\n\nIt is also in our society DNA (which is definitely NOT in our human DNA) the fact to \"work hard\", to \"do something valuable\" if you want to exist socially (work, consume, pay, stay on the road - or commute/work/sleep) and do things just because you have to pay your bills, avoid anything that make you passionate and that is \"useless\" to the society\n\nAs someone said, it's not a good sign of health to be adapted to a sick society. I was on burnout last year. Why? Because I allowed it. I say yes, yes, yes to all and I DON'T listen to myself, to my body, my source, ... If I well calculate, from 2016 to 2017, I lost more than two thousand hours (let say + 40% with transport commute, mind out-work thinking...) just because I complied to a job I don't like\n\nSo now I guess it's hard for me to fit again into society, at least for any salary job.\n\nBurn out doesn't come in one shot! It is drops on a glass, and it takes weeks, sometimes months, but the glass is full after a while and if your soul can handle, your body, your inner source Genius will tell you sooner or later \"I can't handle anymore\". I got the chance to listen to it, to go to the doctor, that saw my (shaking depleted) condition and accepted to place me in sickleave time for 2 weeks.... Happily (YESSS.... happily), 6 weeks after it was my 1-year contract end and they didn't decide to renew it. Because of that. Because I was depleted one day on the morning, 13 months ago, and because I quit at 3pm and decided to listen to my body\n\nFor me it's really important, when your plate is full and you can't handle anymore, to say NO\nIt's so easy to get manipulated, to be poisoned by enterprise culture, sorry for the comparison because it may be false, but as generals and soldiers, pharaoh and pyramid-workers, we can compare with managers and employees.\n\nHappily there are some Mg that are not so bossy, and some even decide to change the rules (cf in Germany, some Mg decided to let the whole team decide - agile mode). But mainly we have to change a LOOOOT of things in our society. First the crap \"country-GDP\" competition. It costs and destroy a lot, human-side, nature-side. Also the enterprise DNA (an enterprise is made for one goal, to make profit. So to increase the sell and to reduce the charge.

It's part a regular tradition in my life where I select a new name to symbolize the end of one phase and the beginning of another. The end in this instance is I finished my degree at Minerva Schools in Political Science and Literature.\n\nProfessionally, I'm working at the [Qualcomm Institute at the University of California](https://qi.ucsd.edu/), San Diego as an education consultant. We were running a piolet of how to teach students the basics of complexity research through an online seminar, and concurrently have them work with research at the university on group projects. Ironically, we don't have any students right now because of the crisis, so I am looking for remote contracts to stay afloat.\n\nI'm still involved in mental health initiatives. I volunteer some time with the [Global Consortium for Academic Mental Health](http://academicmentalhealth.com/). Most of the members are current from across the U.S. and Western Europe. Their aim is to \"cultivate excellent mental health in academics worldwide\".\n\nAt the same time, I've been volunteering a bit with the [Emergence Network](http://www.emergencenetwork.org/). I feel like there could be a lot good synergy between the minds moving in that space and this one! They've got an experimental participatory gathering coming up, May 31st - June 4th. It's called [Wilds Beyond Climate Justice](https://www.wildsbeyondclimatejustice.com/) and promises to be a dance into a different kind of space in the climate discussion.\n\nI've also had the chance to join last year's [Science and Non-Duality](https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/) (SAND) gathering in San Jose. I've really been loving the community around SAND. A lot of free thinkers who see the need to take different approaches to how we understand relations between ourselves, each other, and our planet. \n\nI've also been exploring the concept of becoming a death doula. I've gotten to spend some time volunteering with a hospice and I'm very called to end of life work. I'm still beginning to explore this direction and would love any resource people have come across.\n\nPersonally, I've been using the quarantine to connect with my partner.

Part of it revolved around indicators to measure impact. \n\nI have been hoping that ethnography-at-scale via SSNA could integrate, if not replace, the indicator paradigm. Which, frankly, I do not believe in anymore, after being part of the intellectual effort to \"port\" cost-benefit analysis to environmental externalities in the 1990s. This was spearheaded by UCL, who created a whole research center around it (I used to hang around it as a grad student), the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility and others. \n\nIntellectually, experimental psychologists blew us right out of the water. We were trying to get people to assess their own willingness to pay for, say, avoiding the extinction of some type of frog in Madagascar, or lowering the PM10 content by 10%, and they showed us very convincing evidence that we could never trust our results. And anyway, market allocation only reflects social optima under very restrictive assumptions, that are *never* met in practice.\n\nIn terms of impact, CBA had precious little. Environmental taxes and caps-and-trade left the economy running (and polluting) much like before.\n\nLater on, James Scott made a convincing case for *why* we are so fascinated by scalar indicators. According to him, they are propelled by the modernist ideology that was so successful in underpinning the coalescing of modern states. States discovered they became more powerful if they could superimpose administrative ordering to reality. This worked wonders when it came to \"money and men\", levying taxes and conscripting soldiers. But:\n\n1. It worked wonders *for the states*. For the people... not so much. \n1. As soon as it touched more complex systems (with the invention of scientific forestry in the late 1800s, in Germany), the systems pushed back (managed forests collapsed due to lack of biodiversity, etc.). \n\nModern states have created a demand for scalar indicators (GDP, ROI, the modern central bankers' short-term discount rate etc.), which correspond to scalar \"control knobs\" under their control (keynesian state deficit, money supply etc.). But, according to Scott, this has more to do with their in-built thirst for administrative ordering than with their drive to appreciate what is really going on in complex systems like the economy or the global environment. In the worst case scenario (Stalin's collectivization of agriculture), administrative ordering has sought not to _describe_ reality, but to _change_ it, with violence, if needed. \n\nLast year I finalized a rather bleak document, called the Black Briefing, in which I put together these elements into a critical appreciation of government, and the part played by indicators in it. Nadia was curious about it, so here it is. \n\nhttp://www.cottica.net/2018/03/01/the-black-briefing-why-well-intentioned-policies-fail-so-often-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/", "created_at": "2019-09-09 08:35:24.721571", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 13:43:55.431913", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 67.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71453, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12843, "post_number": 6, "raw": "\"Save the flow\" referred to not interfering with somebody's workflow.

Marina and Alberto on it. Documents [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1gAX_d2y3izsTiSaFEe4cpq4U6x9KiUwk).\n\n# Our strategy\n\nSumming up here as well the three scenarios of ways to go: \n1. **We take the lead.** This means that the call fits to an idea we want to pursue: we write the concept note and build the consortium. Taking the lead means in the \u201cscientific investigator\u201d sense (doing the most of writing), but also coordinating with partners, making the budget etc. Edgeryders is NOT the consortium leader in the administrative sense (formally submitting the application) \u2013 we don\u2019t have the capacity for that. \n    - **Example*: PARTENAIRE application this summer with Climate KIC as the official coordinator.*\n    - **Profiles needed**: this scenario requires a researcher for the scientific part (the usual role of Alberto); others from the team contributing with their expertise for specific parts (what Amelia was doing) and the coordinator for helping in managing partners and the whole process (the usual role of Marina). Assistance in outreach (looking for the suitable partners we can trust) would be useful.\n   - **Estimated workload**: dedicated work over 3 months\n\n2.\t**We join as partners having a more prominent role**. This means we join someone else\u2019s concept, integrate our methodology (mostly standard workpackage) and don\u2019t do most of the writing, but we contribute significantly in the bits of the proposal.\n    - *Example: CYCLOPS application last year. There was a principal investigator but Alberto significantly contributed to the writing and the concept.* \n    - **Profiles needed**: a researcher for the scientific part and the coordinator to do most of the communication with the consortium (including adding the standard, more admin-like, parts to the application) and negotiating budgets. Assistance in outreach to find such forming consortia would be useful. \n    - **Estimated workload**: dedicated work over at least 1 month\n\n3.\t**We join as partners.** This means we use the standard workpackage only slightly adapting it to the topic and the requirements and adjusting the targets.\n     - *Example: TREASURE application this summer. The coordinator did most of the work, we integrated our methodology and Alberto wrote a paragraph so that it fits to the topic.* \n    - **Profiles needed**: researcher (to contribute occasionally where needed), the coordinator to do the rest (sit in the calls, negotiate budgets and add bits and pieces). Assistance in outreach to find such forming consortia would be useful.\n    - **Estimated workload**: 2 days per week over 3 months (for the coordinator), a couple of days over 1 month (for the researcher).\n\nAll of these scenarios require the coordinator to reach out to the team leaders (at Edgeryders) usually responsible for different tasks in the standard workpackage (research, community management, outreach and engagement and tech) and check the feasibility, the KPIs and the allocated budget depending on the proposal.\n\nSetting the internal deadline to do a second round of selection of the calls above for the scenarios under (1) and (2): **by the end of the next week, Friday 30th**. Then, scheduling thematic team calls for each.\n\nThe internal deadline to do the outreach campaign and look for the forming consortia for the scenarios under (2) and (3): **it starts now and should go probably sometime until mid November.** This involves publishing the expression of interest on the participants portal; participating in online networking events; launching the Linkedin campaign + reaching out to personal networks; scheduling 1:1 meetings.

You can additionally make a longer one if you want to send it to the press\n* We also need to have a short number of status updates that are good calls to action. And calls to action are not just like, oh, come here and do that. They have to convey something about the content of the event in a way that's exciting\n* The third thing we need to do is to have excerpts we need to have a summary of the interesting conversations that have been happening on the platform already. There's a backlog of super interesting content: it makes people interested in the event and excited to join it. Write one summary, presenting the ideas somehow in a compact way and with some good quotes.\n* This work needs to be done by copywriters that are specialized in doing copy for the web.\n\nTwo different strategies:\n\n* local event: to get people to actually show up, you interact with each person who said they're interested or going, and let them know:\n  * this is how I heard that you're interested.\n  * These are things you need to know.\n  * And this is how you sign up.\n* More broad communication: all about the content.

And I would never propose ER as a general model. It works for some of us. It does have a large advantage: in general, our ethos does not require an alignment of world views for us to be able to work together with others. It only requires an alignment of action (and coordination modes). Alice could be planting  trees to restore the carbon balance of the planet, and Bob could be planting trees because he wants to glorify his god, and Camilla could be planting trees because she is just plain crazy and has a compulsion to do so. Still, they are creating a forest together. There is no need to agree on why.

My personal choices clearly make a lot of difference, to me (and hopefully people close to me). But if I harbored the ambition to \"change the world\", as so many people used to say only ten years ago... well, different story then. As you zoom out, the small islands of sanity, health and beauty that I might be able to create disappear into the bigger picture. In the early days of Edgeryders, we had to reconcile the outstanding smarts, generosity and successes of so many people here with the hard fact that the larger systems were unchanged. The initiatives of Alessia, Matthias, Anthony and many others have left the world fundamentally the same as they had found it. \n\nUnless... \n\n[quote=\"how, post:10, topic:13451\"]\na small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world.\n[/quote]\n\nthis. Unless, that is, what we are individually doing joins in with what others do, and these small islands join with each other. \n\nIn my personal choices, I try to make \"no regret\" moves. These would be moves that work at the local level, with no need for system change, but would *also* work well as part of a fairer, better, more humane system. If system change comes, I win big.

My name is Nadia. I am an engineer and designer. I am also one of the founders of Edgeryders and do a lot of the creative direction for our work.   \n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/0882f48e-b98e-4132-9a8e-e4c2b6eff66b/-/preview/)\n\nThat photo of my sister and I was taken in 1990 in front of our home in Kuwait City.  \n\nA few weeks later we would be in a car racing through a desert as the world burned.\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/e3c32bea-4160-4c96-8b95-1dea806bc06a/-/preview/)\n\nIn different world, Alberto's band, Modena City Ramblers, was working its way into rock history in his native Italy. \n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/189b313e-447c-4721-b77e-e650caa8bae1/-/preview/)\n\nMatt was probably picking apart some machine or the other in his parents' half built house out in a German village. Hugi, was playing with other toddlers in Rejkjavik. Noemi was growing up in a country now on the path away from communism. John was building the world's first online community, the Well. \n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/3ae59ab1-406c-47bb-892d-5b451d4dd64d/-/preview/)\n\nSoon after I dragged Alberto to a hacker unconference, we started working on a research project at the council of Europe where we met Noemi. The three of us were tasked with figuring out how governments could support youth coping with mass unemployment and widespread precarity. This was 2011 - the year of the anti acta protests and occupy.\n\nOn an open online platform we built, hundreds of individuals shared experiences from trying to build lives in the aftermath of the worst financial meltdown in our lifetime. We needed a way to process all this information. So we developed a methodology and some software to help us see what all of these conversations were telling us.\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/9e5f8278-1027-4d85-acf6-f5e7dff71026/-/preview/)\n\nA pattern emerged from these conversations.  What was needed to cope with chaotic environments was not to attain a specific status on the labour market. It was infrastructure on which we could build good lives while doing work that is meaningful to us. Living, emergent infrastructure that weaves together the relational, physical and organisational.\n\nIt needed to be resilient to the shocks that would soon be upon us due to climate crisis, ecosystems collapse and a financial system gone rogue. So we prototyped what such an infrastructure could look like.\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/ae67658a-e949-46f4-b15b-55463981cdb4/-/preview/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/48a7b579-431f-457d-b763-83726013cf31/-/preview/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b1808e14-01fd-49cd-81dd-db6f5a3f933e/-/preview/)\n\n We documented the experience extensively. What we learned is that the best plan for us is no plan. Rather our approach would be to weave together and grow a large and diverse enough collective of talented people. With whom to build and adapt what we need along the way.\n\nThe original software for sensemaking is now part of a stack of digital tools for distributed co-creation, our own messaging apps, virtual coworking rooms etc. And people are using the infrastructure, tools and practices to build new projects and businesses. \n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/56176b27-1924-4dc7-8e2d-3b79f2f8aa0f/-/preview/)\n\n**As I write this countless people are losing their jobs and businesses.**  **We think we can help many people to navigate this and future storms.**\n\nSeen from here, the situation right now is not unlike it was during that fateful year when the world broke (open) for me. This state of immobility in which we find ourselves makes it even clearer: we are one another's best resource in this no man's land between what is no more and what is not yet.\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/fb75473e-944f-411e-ab9f-dbccfa905f7b/-/preview/)\n\n**Right now we have a unique opportunity to better equip people to tackle the current and future crises.** \n\nWe want to:\n\n1. Quickly upskill a critical mass of people to discover and adopt the way we work to build  productive communities. \n\n2. More allies, like yourself, who can kick open a few doors and help us get allies to partner with us and support our work.\n\n**The individuals at the heart of Edgeryders have spent significant parts of our lives navigating the kind of chaos others are now struggling with.** \n\nWe know what needs to be done and how to do it. \n\nWith your support we will make it happen faster and better.\n\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/3425d8fc-2f84-45f4-9532-d60e3675e2a4/-/preview/)\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\nEnquiries: company@edgeryders.eu", "created_at": "2020-05-09 09:48:39.587103", "updated_at": "2020-07-16 06:42:46.197021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 823, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62011, "user_id": 5483, "topic_id": 11224, "post_number": 14, "raw": "@pbihr we (@mrchrisadams) inquired [Supermarkt Kreuzberdg](https://supermarkt-berlin.net/en/) and would just need to send the invoice for the 22nd November to Edgeryders.

On my part, I promise to keep track of how it goes.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m curious as to what were peoples\u2019 reactions when you introduce this programme, and what are those fabulous examples you are showcasing in your discussion and research meetings?\u00a0\n\nAlso, what do you want to achieve at the end of the day with this? Yes, people will better understand the \u00a0possibilities to make smth with their lives, probably boost some confidence, and after that? Is it merely recognizing the real potential of this generation or something in addition to this as well? It\u2019s the same when the Edgeryders team are asked when presenting the project: and so what.. ? what after the Transition Handbook you will present? what will change?..

The practices associated with it have been known to have certain impacts on the environment. The most notable of these effects includes climate change and general environmental degradation.\nOur journey began in Tifelt, a rural region in morocco where we met farmers like Abdelkader. Abdelkader is a mixed farmer, he relies on strawberries, bananas and orange to generate multiple revenue streams for his family. However, Abdelkader was facing serious problems on his farm. First, his crop productivity is below estimations and affected by diseases and pests. Second, the soil degrades and becomes unusable due to intensive use of pesticides, fertilizers.\nAbdelkader is not alone, 7 out of 10 farmers are mixed ones, and they are alongside the X million smallholder farmers across the world urgently need new solutions to increase their productivity without doing harm.\nBecause we believe that there is no problem too big, too daunting or too difficult to solve, we were looking for transformative and radically new business model that rethinks the most deeply-ingrained patterns in farmers\u2019 behaviors. As a result, we launched our project I-TERRA, an introduction to smart agriculture.\n\nto know more about our project click here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_n0w8Y8UtYbzZ4taG7pzAJmS-3sgv5ld?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-11-23 18:59:05.169335", "updated_at": "2019-11-23 18:59:05.169335", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 224, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 53.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73811, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12920, "post_number": 21, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-04-06 17:14:28.065416", "updated_at": "2020-04-06 17:14:28.065416", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44648, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 8582, "post_number": 8, "raw": "I\u2019ve been trying to decide if Robert Heinlein\u2019s \u2018Stranger in a strange land\u2019 would fit into this.

A convening, but not just for talking.\n\nThat sounds fun. If by \"at Woodbine\" you mean in NYC, then with enough advance warning I might be able to attend personally.

C'est-\u00e0-dire que cela pourrait \u00eatre tout aussi d\u00e9cevant dans l'esprit des citoyens.\n\nSi les noms des partis politiques changent, il pourrait arriver qu'ils v\u00e9hiculent plus ou moins les m\u00eame id\u00e9es, et que leurs plate-formes \u00e9lectorales se ressemblent, \u00e0 quelques variantes pr\u00e8s.

Just note that after this change we will report to the European Commission the \"agreed on costs\", not necessarily \"actual costs\". Because we determine costs based on timesheets then, not based on invoices (of which we will no longer know to which work package they belong). The difference is: if somebody tracked worktime for a reporting period but did not invoice it in that reporting period (yet), we still already report it.\n\nIf that's permissible (probably yes, as it's like trade debits / credits in our accounting) then it's even better for us as it allows collaborators to get deferred payouts (like I use to do it at times).\n\nThe purpose of tagging invoices by work package number was to report only the actual costs.\n\nWhen making that change, we also no longer need to collect `entry_date` for invoices, as we will instead collect the information from timesheets. Oh and `h2020_costtype=personnel` could be assumed as a default if the invoice is by a collaborator.

The solution to this problem is taking an altogether new approach: abandoned buildings are not liabilities but <b>assets </b>that need to be made the most of.\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>The web is the natural habitat for [im]possible living, because it represents the only environment where the critical mass needed to face the problem of abandonment as a whole can come together (in Italy only, there are an estimated 2 millions of abandoned buildings).\u00a0</em>\n\n<strong>We started from a simple observation: all over the web there are numerous examples of individuals engaged in similar projects, mapping differently sized areas, aggregating communities and getting public and private associations involved. Each one of these local units have a website, a community that needs to be kept up to date and fostered. The work involved in creating and maintaining online tools takes time and expertise that are not readily available to everyone. In addition to time and expertise constraints, the multiplication of projects makes the world revolving around the topic of abandonment very fragmented, incapable of networking.\u00a0</strong>\n\nWe want to be <b>enablers </b>and simply wipe away the hurdles that make it difficult to carry out rescue projects, from mapping to redevelopment. It is an ambitious goal, but we believe in it and we are investing everything in this dream! \u00a0\n\n<b>The first step ahead is the construction of the biggest, most complete database of abandoned buildings in the world, and to get things started we have developed the beta version of our service.\u00a0</b>\n\n<b>The product </b>is a website designed to be the simplest tool possible to browse the abandoned buildings that have been mapped all around the world and view the descriptive *schede*. In each *scheda* there is a general description of the building and a few important details, such as construction year, abandonment year, floor area, number of floors. For users who want to be <a href=\"http://www.impossibleliving.com/create/step_1/\">proactive</a>, the website makes it possible to add new vacant buildings, rate those already present, and contribute to the completeness of each *scheda* by adding media content (photos and videos).\u00a0\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://blog.impossibleliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/lancio4.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px; \">\n\nIn a few weeks we will release a <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/it/artist/im-possible-living/id430487810\"><b>mobile application </b></a>designed for instantly reporting a new vacant\u00a0building. Once logged in, the app allows to shoot a picture of the building on the spot or pick one from the media library, and add basic information, while automatically capturing the geographical data associated to the building\u2019s position (street, city etc). The geographical info can be edited by the user if incorrect.

That\u2019s an interesting take\n[/quote]\n\nI would take matters differently - to sketch (without dwelling on system-conform absurdities of the current hegemonical social/societal manner to organize \u2018civilisation\u2019 that could be ended without questioning basic system features):\n \nFirst, being 7-11 billion human beings, even when they/we consume and produce (very) differently than today, we will need a global economy to provide goods and commodities needed for (a decent) life. It makes sense to use (=/= exploite) differential advantages to produce a given commodiy / good. Any future economy will be a global.exchange of goods and commodities; although (likely) differently organised as today. \n\nSecond, a market is a process to exchange goods on the basis of their value. That is not stupid, per se, but raises the question of 'what value' and how value is measured (this seems to be a key-question; see Le Monde Diplomatique earlier this year). Simplified: Currently, we express in our economi/ies value through the prize to reproduce a good at a given geographical place and time; that is 'demand & supply thinking'; the cost/prize of a good is (partially) decoupled from its 'value of use'. This is a distortion (to end). Also we produce goods without internalising in its prize the full cost of the good; we operate not in closed but in an open system (example: emissions/pollution, inputs/rawmaterials at extraction cost, etc.). This kind of features leads to very distorted exchanges at the 'market' (whether global or local). These distorted markets are embedded in a culture / thinking that justifies the current way of production and exchange. This kind of an 'open system economy / societal set up' will have to find its end; it is not sustainable at least not for a population of 7-11 billion people. Therefore it has to end, for the fluxes of many substances - carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphate,... water,... biodiversity. \n\nThird, the (European-made) societal construct of the nation-state is a quite recent historical development that emerged in junction with the current (hegeomonial) economic / social model (replacing the 'ancien r\u00e9gime). If that model (to organise big groups of people to produce/consume/...) is modified / replaced then the nation-state may change too. But what  could  come at its place, the 'nation state' is currenly the (THE) means to organize groupings of several 10 / 100 million people?\n\nAll the best and happy to continue the exchange!\nMartin", "created_at": "2019-09-15 17:37:52.561970", "updated_at": "2019-09-15 21:00:58.203237", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 427, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [59283], "is_reply_to": [59283], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63564, "user_id": 5560, "topic_id": 11457, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@Yohka_Anna", "created_at": "2019-11-08 21:41:44.792485", "updated_at": "2019-11-08 21:41:44.792485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13254, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1403, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>\"Work Retail\"</b>\n\nI saw a fantastic piece years ago, I can't find it now, which was called \"Work Retail\" and it was advice to young artists suggesting they get a job they really didn't care about - something not too difficult, in fact - and then work the hell out of their art in a completely disciplined way.\n\nWhat it was suggesting, very carefully, that people avoid was interesting jobs which were more fun and more likely to distract people into thinking that the work mattered or was important in its own right.\n\nIt was about conservation of meaning, keeping one thing in your life meaningful (the art) and letting the job be background, something not worth worrying about or investing in.

Most open data activists push for releasing data under licenses that don't forbid commercial uses, such as Creative Commons Zero (CC0). Many people think that companies should be encouraged to build businesses on top of public sector information and open data. That, in principle, can create a conflict. I remember an example from Norway, in which one company pulled data from the weather service, put it on a website and stuck Adsense on it. They got a lot of visits, and had a small business going: it was literally a matter of building the website, then standing back and watching the money roll in. A year later, the weather service renovated their own website and put up an almost identical looking map of Norway with icons to signify weather conditions, based, of course on the same data - but with no Adsense. The company protested: the weather service was displacing private business! But the weather service claimed that Norwegian taxpayers had purchased those data already, and they had a right to accessing them at no extra cost.\n\nI wrote \"in principle\", because in practice I am not sure this is even\u00a0 a problem. I doubt a sustainable business can be built on the basis of a dataset that is free for all to access. Maybe the only situation in which this can happen is a market that is just large enough to accomodate one firm. This seems what is happening in the USA with the Weather Channel, one of my favourite TV channels ever (24/7/365 weather forecast in all possible flavours!!! I used to watch it all the time when I was on tour in the US). It runs on open data, but apparently there is no market for two 24/7 weather channels, so their business is safe and profitable (and poses a fairness issue in my view: but you can regulate it in principle, so to extract parrt of the positional rent).\n\nAnyway, you can fine-tune the use people make of the data by using the appropriate license, like Creative Commons - Noncommercial. The consensus in the open data movement seems to be you don't want to do that.\u00a0 The problem you raise, in my view, is one of security and accountability of access to the data: you can't stop people using Google from searching gov websites, but what you can do is provide open, well-documented APIs and licenses to your data. Then, if Google turns evil or goes down, access can be rebuilt on top of the existing infrastructure.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-12 15:50:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.297703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 451, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8837], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5554, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5521, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Looks like one for @Nadia.\u00a0\n\nDeadline for registration is gone, but it can probably be hacked.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f3bde66f76ada7e618b195f7b81760404f5bcdae.jpg\" width=\"353\" height=\"500\">\n\nDate: 2016-04-14 11:45:00 - 2016-04-14 11:45:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2016-04-14 09:57:42", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 07:31:03.469419", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 60, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58508, "user_id": 5308, "topic_id": 10623, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hi Natalia and thanks for the welcome.\nThe number of people in Serbia supporting the country's accession to the European Union has been declining for years.

Incidentally, embeddedness in a mass society might be deeper in Europe than in the U.S., that has an individualistic ideology to lean on.

Likewise, any additional resources provided will also be tailored to project needs.\n**Who is eligible?**\nThe Challenge is open to any not-for-profit charity, other not-for-profit organisation, public or private\nacademic or research institution, or for-profit social enterprise company with a charitable project that is\nlocated in one of the following countries: Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nBulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and United Kingdom. Unfortunately, individuals without organisational affiliation are ineligible.\n**Can my organisation submit a joint application with another organisation?**\nOnly one organisation may be the applicant of record, but we welcome and encourage collaboration -\nespecially between technical and social sector experts. The application allows you to specify partners\nwho will be critical to your work. If your application is selected to receive a grant, the applicant\norganisation will be the sole recipient of the grant, but may subgrant or subcontract with other\norganisations to complete the proposed project as long as all organisations comply with the terms of the grant agreement.\n\n**Project info**\n\nA project is your organisation\u2019s proposed concept and implementation plan for how you will use\ntechnology to accelerate progress towards a greener, more resilient future or support others to do so. If\nselected for a grant, grant funds will be supporting the implementation of this project - so we need to\nknow exactly how the grant will help you realise your plan.\n**Can the project be in the idea stage? Does this have to be a new idea for my organisation?**\nYes - we\u2019re happy to consider early-stage ideas with a clear and feasible plan for implementation that will benefit society. Ideas need not be brand new - in fact, they may already be a work in progress. In all cases, we would like to hear exactly how a grant will change the trajectory of your progress toward\nimplementation, scale, and impact.\n**Over what time period should the grant funds be spent?**\nWe expect the grant to be spent over the course of 12 to 36 months.\n**Can the grant be used to fund overhead and staffing costs?**\nYes, but the large majority of the award should be devoted to the implementation of the project. For-profit organisations may only use grant funds for staffing and overhead directly related to the charitable project. For universities and other academic institutions, overhead expenses should be limited to 10% of the total budget or less. This maximum rate applies to the primary grantee, sub-grantees, and sub-contractors.\n**What kind of support will Google provide to help me implement my project?**\nAll selected grantees will be invited to participate in the Google for Startups Accelerator. By submitting\nyour project, you are agreeing to arrange for senior staff members to participate in the Accelerator\nprogramme (either virtually or in-person).\n\nEIT Climate-KIC will be partnering with Google on its Impact Challenge on Climate as well, https://www.climate-kic.org/news/eit-climate-kic-to-work-with-google-on-impact-challenge/.\n\nMore information is available here: https://impactchallenge-app.withgoogle.com/climate-challenge/#!/page/1, https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/site/static/climate2020/downloads/faqs_en.pdf,\nhttps://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/site/static/climate2020/downloads/application.pdf.\nWhat do you think? @nadia, @matthias, @owen", "created_at": "2020-09-21 09:20:35.106245", "updated_at": "2020-09-21 09:23:53.275566", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 920, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 43.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88090, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14253, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-12-03 09:46:51.373994", "updated_at": "2020-12-03 09:46:51.373994", "deleted_at": "2020-12-03 09:46:54.712634", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3488, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3455, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;font-size:13px;font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;border-collapse:collapse;border:1px solid \\#ccc\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"461\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td style=\"padding:2px 3px 2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;\">\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:21px;\">\n\n<td style=\"padding:2px 3px 2px 3px;vertical-align:bottom;font-weight:bold;\">1.

I\u2019ll have schooling for the next 2,5 years mainly on the weekends in Budapest and I\u2019ll have blocks of workshops in the Czech Republic. Beside of this I also have my regular 8-5 job in Brno.\n\nBefore moving to Brno a year ago I worked for 6 years in Vienna as a biologist in an population genetic/conservation genetic laboratory and now I have the opportunity to go back to this pervious job. After considering this for long I decided to take this chance and move back to Vienna.\n\nMy plan is of course to continue my dance therapy studies, but for this transition period it is a better option for me to be in Vienna. It is closer to Budapest, so I need to spend less time with travelling and I can also save more money. And last but not least I will be close to my very good Viennese friends again.\n\nBrno is a really nice and livable city with a lot of events all around the year. I came here after growing up in Budapest and living the last 6 years in Vienna and to be honest I was affraid that life in this \u201esmall\u201d city will be boring. Of course the richness of events is not compairable with Vienna or Budapest, but the city is full of life and there are always programs to choose from, I am never bored.\n\nAlso Brno has a very good location for outdoor activities, which I like a lot. You don\u2019t even need to leave the city and you can find nice woods for small hikes and with only a bit of travelling you can make bigger hikes, bike tours, in winter cross country sky tours or you can skate on a lake.\n\nMany positive expericenses, but with speaking Czech language only on a basic level (and with not drinking beer :-)) it is very difficult for me to make strong connections to people and I have a feeling that I am a bit isolated here.\n\nThe road of my life brings me back to Vienna for a while now, but for sure this won\u2019t be the endstation.

A version of Open Ethnographer that works on Discourse was deployed and is now being used by Amelia. Most annotations made on Drupal were also imported to the new Open Ethnographer; the others will soon follow suit. \n\nMeanwhile, new content continued to flow in, and it was created directly on the new platform. We are now in a position to merge this new content with the pre-existing one, code it, process it with GraphRyder and write our final results. In terms of the new platform's architecture (based on \"categories\", \"topics\" and \"posts\", rather than on groups, posts, and comments), what counts as OpenCare content is:\n\n* Everything in the OpenCare category and all its subcategories, except subcategory \"Open Care Research\"\n* Everything in the OpenVillage Festival category (which is all new content).\n* Individual topics that, though they arose in the context of other projects, are judged to be relevant to OpenCare. Just like with Drupal, we have ways to to tell the platform to funnel those topics into the Open Ethnographer coding queue. There is some new content from mostly Northern African contributors coming through from a different project. This has a different focus, so most projects there are not about care. We will code those that are.\n\nAs of now, we have 297 unique contributors with 997 topics and about 3,500 contributions (but we have not yet corralled the individual topics yet).

Your points are regular points of criticism of PoS algorithms, and as far as I know the PoS chains use some additional mechanisms to mitigate the issues.\n\nFor example, the blockchain nodes (\"computers with cryptotoken values\") which are eligible to confirm the next block are determined with a random element to it, not just by their size of stake. And I think there are always several of them to confirm the next block and they vote, with some mechanism in place to determine what is the right block to choose if there is a disagreement among the nodes.

To give you a brief idea of the project, check out the website (in progress) <a href=\"http://hackingutopia.cre8tives.org/\">HACKING UTOPIA</a>\u00a0for the University project. There I collect inspiring projects, methods and texts to help us get started. The plan so far is to kick-off with an intense workshop week before the semester starts (somewhere between April 4 - 17) where we (@nadia and hopefully Ezio Manzini) introduce Service Design / Design Thinking to the students and jump into the topic. The goal is to have a first concept or idea for a product/service in the context of OpenCare at the beginning of the semester which then can be tested, iterated, improved in the time following. In our case the degree of working on social transformation has to remain rather small because we have the deliverable for the crowdfunding campaign on kickstarter (products/services) which needs to be developed in the same time. I think it is realistic to induce transformation/change by implementing little tweaks and improvements with our ideas, that's at least the goal. I want the students (who study product design - yes, making products, artefacts and things) to get familiar with a wider understanding of design as a transformative skill not limited to stuff but open enough to have social impact (which of course products have always had in a way).\n\nThe term runs from April 18 until July 22, by then we need prototypes and crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nUnfortunately I can't make it to LOTE5 because I will be traveling in February (and as far as I understood Nadia the dates are set, because I could come a week earlier), however I want to start a conversation about how we can cross pollinate and interact with the University project and the bigger goal of the OpenCare Research project. \u00a0So as much as we have some constraints in form of deliverables and a certain content environment due to the faculty the course will be held in (product design) we want to contribute to the bigger picture as well as get input and feedback from you guys. Does this make sense?\u00a0\n\nI saw that you will be running some workshops at the LOTE5, what exactly is your background? Maybe you are interested in collaborating with our project?\n\n<span>best, Susa</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-07 12:59:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.715709", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69575, "user_id": 6272, "topic_id": 12546, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Zdravo @noemi, hvala na lepim re\u010dima dobrodo\u0161lice!\nDobila sam preporuku od prijatelja da se prijavim na platformu.\nZvu\u010di sjajno istra\u017eiti potencijal zelenog urbanog \u017eivota i potpuno u saglasnosti sa onim \u010dime se mi bavimo. \u0160to se ti\u010de projekta Zeleni koncept stanovanja imali smo sre\u0107u da sara\u0111ujemo sa privatnim investitorom koji je kompletan koncept implementirao na svom stambenom objektu, bez da je to na kraju uticalo na cenu kvadrata stana.

But anyway, by now it's apparent that the growth rate is no longer exponential, which means, the interventions have an effect.\n\nThen today I thought, can we predict the total number of cases or deaths in a country then? I look around, and the best model I can find is in a completely under-appreciated paper on a pre-print server: \"[Predicting the ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07912.pdf)\". Its first predictions from March 19 about the Italy situation were not accurate, but of course a model becomes more accurate the more data it can rely on. So I expect its predictions will be better now.\n\nAnd then I find a tweet by the paper's author that says, look, we made [a COVID19 forecasting tool based on live data](https://kooplex-fiek.elte.hu/notebook/report-pkrisz5-covid19dashmodel---/report/):\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vattay/status/1242956634248425474\n\n(Note, you select the country in the bottom-right using the little circles in front of country names.) There *might* be ways to create an even better model, of course. But this one (based on a logistic growth model) is already much, much better than just looking at a graph and visually fitting a curve \u2013 which I used to do so far. It's like the weather forecast but for a pandemic. Logistic growth is simply what happens to an exponential function that runs out of fuel (means, R<1 as they say, the goal of social distancing and lockdown: everyone infected infects less than one more person).\n\nSo for everyone struggling with the uncertainty of how long this first wave of the pandemic will go on and how many people will die, I warmly recommend this tool. It even has a line that says: \"Estimated number of days until it's over: \u2026\". :yellow_heart: :blush: For Italy, the prediction from 2020-03-26 looks like this:\n\n![PredictedCOVID19CasesIntaly|690x352](upload://1ogkZXi8Eqiqa33daVI0kkCkvAD.png)\n\n(@alberto: Not super sure, but I think you will like this modeling.

Each workshop fits up to 100 participants.\n\n### Workshop 1: Discovering alternative paths to resilient local economies for post-covid19 recovery\n\nGoal. Done right, sustained engagement of citizens has far-reaching (and not always obvious) consequences on internal processes, power dynamics, management of the funding cycle and other deep features of the institutional landscape. However \"done right\" entails awareness of how valuable the collective intelligence of citizens is, and the will to engage with them in substantial, not just formal ways.  We aim to reach a shared understanding of the mix of technology, methodology, institutions and ethics underpinning successful efforts to engage citizens in  economic resilience. Output: a collaborative writeup of the theme at hand as understood by the group. Outcome: participants converge on the vision of the problem, priorities and key challenges.\n\nActivities:\n\n* Part 1: Setting up. Listening sessions and deep Q&A about 3 cases of unconventional paths to economic resilience and regeneration in response to crises. \n* Part 2: interactive session. Participants will use a simple web application to interrogate an ethnographic dataset on community responses to care needs. These responses, largely bottom-up, can be read as a particularly active form of citizen engagement. The data reveal the deep motivations and narrative behind the citizens' decision to engage with public issues. Requires laptops. Output: a map of the determinants of participation based on the dataset. Outcome: sophisticated understanding of novel paths to building resilient local economies in response to Covid19, and ahead of future crises (e.g due to climate change).\n\n### Workshop 2: Citizen engagement readiness for post Covid19 economic recovery\n\nGoal. Policy Interventions to revitalise local economies do not exist in a vacuum, nor are they drawn on a blank slate. They are small piece of a large ecosystem with the institutional actors at its centre. The cultural differences between the culture of any large organization and the protagonists of novel paths to economic regeneration on the ground makes it inevitable to navigate tradeoffs, reach compromises, and incorporate constraints. We aim to reach a shared understanding of these in the case at hand, so that the new initiatives to rebuild regional economies can be radical and innovative, while not clashing with its parent organizations.\n\nActivities:\n\nPart 1: Setting up processes and design principles. Output: a collaborative writeup of the theme at hand as understood by the group. Outcome: participants converge on the vision of the problem, priorities and key challenges.\n\nPart 2: Building the specifications for successful engagement of citizens in efforts to build regional conditions for resilient livelihoods in the aftermath of Covid19. This is a whiteboard-and-post-its session intended to map the main points of attention and propose solutions. Its output is a specification document for the team in charge of programs' rollout (for example a prototype flow chart of the process to engage in co-design of the programs). Outcome: awareness of the points of failure of building momentum amongst the citizenry to birth new paths to resilient livelihoods.\n\nExamples of outputs from previous, comparable workshop we held at the World Bank\n\n[Edgeryders Workshop Follow Up report_ Text based.pdf|attachment](upload://zTHkgoJ5KsdIrju6b2q2WjZmmQj.pdf) (1.1 MB) [Edgeryders Workshop Report_ Findings, Insights, Discussions.pdf|attachment](upload://5i8UTCMajyekN5nV5aFHFJa3VvL.pdf) (6.6 MB)\n\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\nEnquiries: company@edgeryders.eu", "created_at": "2020-05-09 13:00:36.554179", "updated_at": "2020-05-22 06:15:28.047707", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84477, "user_id": 6749, "topic_id": 14460, "post_number": 38, "raw": "**Are you interested in exploring speculative futures or have even done so before?

Like everyone else, I engage in social distancing, and stay at home a lot. \n\nBut not *exactly* like everyone else. My life is a little different, because my home is different. I live in [The Reef](https://thereef.brussels), the prototype of a new kind of lived space. Its inhabitants are humans and small businesses. They share a roof to live in harmony with each other, their neighborhood, and the planet.  What we have now is only a prototype, four bedrooms instead of the 15-30 we envision. But still, the pandemic is putting it through an unexpected test. What can we learn from it? How does one live in a co-housing space during a pandemic? \n\nPretty well, it turns out. \n\n### The compound structure creates a natural \"oasis\"\n\nThe Reef prototype consists of two self-standing lofts, facing each other across a courtyard, plus various bits and pieces. The compound squats in what used to be a factory complex. Access to the street is through a long and narrow private hallway. During the lockdown phase, the hallway is a natural \"hot zone\". Deliveries arrive here, where we can disinfect them or simply leave them for a few days, until out-of-host viral DNA breaks down. We also keep masks, rubber gloves and hand sanitizer here for when we go out. \n\n![hallway|690x388](upload://wcM8lyPXjp5HzO7Ph2SB5yPndAP.jpeg) ![masks|690x388](upload://i3OvTDYhNXMHOw2QsB4EcnHKXxB.jpeg) \n\n\nOnce inside the Reef proper, the dweller gets a nice sense of peace and protection. The city seems far away (unless the school next door is giving children a mid-morning break, which of course does not happen in lockdown). The courtyard is a great resource when the weather is sunny. It gets direct sunlight for most of the year, and its high surrounding walls create a sense of quiet and concentration, a little like an oasis. \n\n![garden|690x388](upload://iDyPcWGVKRJRFvt0yq8pEMZLLbS.jpeg) \n\n### Instant neighborhood office\n\nWe reconverted to office one of the living room + kitchen open spaces. Edgeryders rents it as its Brussels office. So, in a normal weekday 2-5 of my colleagues work from here, though I am the only one that also lives in the compound. During lockdown, my colleagues work from home, so I have offered the office to my housemates. No working from the couch for us! We get a proper professional space, clean and minimalistic, with fast Internet, a decent printer, a whiteboard, projectors, external screens and so on. \n![office|690x388](upload://eEmuRZagIhK0zSvTpx5iJEoxZml.jpeg) \n\nThis is especially nice, because it realizes our vision of the \"neighborhood co-working space\". Many people appreciate going to the office, where they can socialize with colleagues and work from a space that is physically and mentally separated from the home and the family.  But there is no reason to dive into traffic: you can get the same things in a remote work-ready facility five minutes walking from your door. No more commuting! \n\nAs I write this, four people use the office of the Reef every day. One works in the IT department of a bookshops chain. Another is a developer for a mobile phone company. Yet another works in a logistics company. And finally, I work for Edgeryders. We work side by side, chat over lunch breaks, and generally do everything you do in any office. It works great, there are no problems that I can see. \n\n### Redundancy brings  resilience\n\nEach of our two lofts is a fully independent unit. We have eliminated some duplication: for example, as I wrote above, one of the two living-kitchen spaces has become the office. But the redundancy is still there, and can be deployed as needed. Last week, for example, we had a brief scare when we found some water on the kitchen floor. We determined it was coming from the dishwasher. During lockdown, it could be problematic to get a plumber to  come over and fix it. But guess what: in the office we have a *second* dishwasher \u2013 in fact we have two full kitchens, two full bathrooms and two toilets. It takes a lot of trouble to take us down. Redundant systems for the win! \n\nWe even have a sketch of a plan for if one of us gets infected. The infected person's room immediately becomes a \"hot room\". We will vacate the floor, and leave it at the disposal of the infected person (only two rooms per floor, so only one room to vacate). This way, the infected person will have a bit of breathing space, and his or her own bathroom. One of us will have to sleep in the living room or the office (we have couches and an inflatable mattrass), which sucks but beats the alternatives. \n\n### Extra spaces for unusual activities \n\nMore people living in the same roof means getting some economies of scale. For example, we only have one washing machine in the whole compound. This means that we are more efficient than nuclear families in using space. We use the extra square meters for unusual, nice-to-have activities, especially in lockdown. For example, we now use one of the landings as a mini-workout space.\n\n![minigym|690x388](upload://oCdB4oynbEukmxxPj8dG0oAQkB7.jpeg) \n\nThe sink of the second kitchen is now the basis for producing DIY hand sanitizer. \n\n![DIY_sanitizer|690x388](upload://wGWWZPRe0DZKkhsLh7NtsNcBa5j.jpeg) \n\nAnd this is nothing. A former housemate had reclaimed our largest closet to use as a sort of biohacking lab, where he grew all sorts of mushrooms and yeasts. I expect even more creativity as we go. \n\n### Social distancing, but not isolation\n\nEven in lockdown, the microcosm of The Reef offers some sociality.  We have small or long chat over the dining table. We play board games. Last Friday we ordered in some Thai food. It beats living alone in a studio apartment. \n\nAnd, even with only four people, we have a bit of social structure. We are four individuals; two of us are a couple, and they spend more time with each other  than with the rest of us. And then there is the collective, everyone together, for activities like planning the groceries or the cleaning. With 15-30 people, I expect to observe a richer structure, much like that you would find in a band of hunters-gatherers. \n\n### In sum, pretty good!\n\nThe prototype Reef is just this: a prototype. If this were the full Reef, we would be twenty instead of four. We would have more skills, manpower, facilities. We would probably be making masks for the whole neighborhood. Hell, we would be making *electricity*.  We would be handing out spare laptops to families in need of extra devices for the kids' remote learning. And so on.\n\nBut, as long as the full Reef lies still in the future, I can't think of a better place to be locked in than this. This is remarkable, because we certainly did not design it with a pandemic in mind! In my book, this shows that the Reef's concept is robust to unknown unknowns.

Tell us what inspires your thought experiments and where your interest originates:** <br /> Yes! I have published science fiction short stories since 2010 and for the past years I have written fictional pieces for companies such as CloudWalk and ArmaSuisse,  both in Portuguese and in English. This year, alongside Envisioning, I have created an interactive narrative called Legaco in which I explore the future of human-machine interaction by tackling technologies and concepts such as mind uploading, robotics, immersive technologies, and biotechnology. I have also written the first drafts of the interactive narrative on the future of privacy for L'Atelier BNP Paribas and helped with the research of emerging technologies in 2019. \nMy inspirations are mostly drawn from my research on emerging technologies but I also like to add philosophical and sociological questions to the narrative. In my PhD thesis, I explore how humans have been trying to achieve immortality through images since the beginning of history till the creation of VR avatars, and for that I have read authors such as Freud, Schopenhauer, Flusser, Bystrina, Belting, Ari\u00e8s, Becker, and many others that address the subject of mortality but then combining with my research and foresight in recent research on consciousness, biotechnology, robotics, immersive technologies, and so on. Finally, I also aim to deliver a story beautifully written and with a rich and complex world building as one can find in the stories of Ursula K Le Guinn, Octavia Butler, Bruce Sterling, or Philip K. Dick, for instance, who are some of my favorite science fiction writers and an inspiration for me. <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-10-09 14:13:14.332763", "updated_at": "2020-10-09 14:13:14.332763", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 278, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 53.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 8, 6752], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48482, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8843, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Ah, that's not the way it works.

My goal was to find out if there is any reliable way to identify posts that are interesting for ethnographers *before* any ethnographer reads them. The payoff of doing so are potentially large, because it turns out that annotations (a proxy of meaning, or semantic density) are very unevenly distributed across posts. We could make coding efficient by showing ethnographers only the ones with the highest predicted semantic density... if we could predict reliably which ones are those. \n\nHere's what I did. \n\n## Data and code \n\nI used the SSNA datasets from three projects:\n\n* OpenCare\n* PopRebel\n* NGI Forward\n\nOnly the first  one was completed. The other two are not as reliable, because coding follows posting at some distance. For this reason, some of the newer posts might be semantically very dense, and still have no annotation yet. In practice, the concatenated dataset with all three projects (8,512 posts, 10,146 annotations) behaves in a very similar way to its subset containing only OpenCare data (3,700 posts, 5,769 annotations).\n\nEdgeryders APIs offer the following information about a post:\n\n* `posts_in_topic`, number of posts in the same topic (or thread).\n* `char_count`, the length of the post.\n* `reply_count`, the number of direct replies that specific post (as opposed to the whole topic) received. \n* `reads`, the number of times that post was read. This is a bit of an estimate: Discourse has infinite scrolling: when you visit a topic your browser loads its first 20 posts, if you keep scrolling it loads 20 more and so on. 'readers_count' is the number of unique visitors that viewed that post. These two metrics are almost perfectly collinear. \n* `incoming_link_count` is the number of links pointing to the post (including those generated by search engines during searches).\n* `quote_count`is the number of times this post is quoted in other posts.\n* `score` is an overall quality score, pre-baked by Discourse. It is [a weighted average](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/score_calculator.rb) of some of the indicators above. \n* The number of `annotations` is of course the number of times each post is annotated. I compute this via some wrangling of data downloaded from the `annotations.json` endpoint.\n\nMy code is [here](https://github.com/edgeryders/explore-ssna-data/blob/master/code/explore_SSNA_data.ipynb). \n\n### Frequency counts  and correlation \n\n`annotations` and several of the quality metrics have exponential-ish behavior: their frequency counts looks more or less like a straight line on a log-linear plot.\n\n![image|375x264](upload://e0nvGfJag1WK7O49df3cR1mltKr.png) \n\n![image|374x264](upload://xt6Bvq5MjfGOtzdJrnsqHvPChFx.png) \n\n![image|375x264](upload://mj8CJPwJpP1gcDru1xOa4TdGDwI.png) \n\nThe correlation matrix looks like this: \n\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>annotations</th>\n      <th>posts_in_topic</th>\n      <th>char_count</th>\n      <th>reply_count</th>\n      <th>reads</th>\n      <th>readers_count</th>\n      <th>incoming_link_count</th>\n      <th>quote_count</th>\n      <th>score</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>annotations</th>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>-0.063251</td>\n      <td>0.314787</td>\n      <td>0.035931</td>\n      <td>0.053185</td>\n      <td>0.053182</td>\n      <td>0.106176</td>\n      <td>-0.022958</td>\n      <td>0.114783</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>posts_in_topic</th>\n      <td>-0.063251</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>-0.112495</td>\n      <td>0.182892</td>\n      <td>0.409954</td>\n      <td>0.409959</td>\n      <td>-0.005901</td>\n      <td>0.120444</td>\n      <td>0.013525</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>char_count</th>\n      <td>0.314787</td>\n      <td>-0.112495</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>-0.017715</td>\n      <td>0.056545</td>\n      <td>0.056542</td>\n      <td>0.178403</td>\n      <td>-0.017490</td>\n      <td>0.191785</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>reply_count</th>\n      <td>0.035931</td>\n      <td>0.182892</td>\n      <td>-0.017715</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>0.167755</td>\n      <td>0.167748</td>\n      <td>0.015386</td>\n      <td>0.091541</td>\n      <td>0.047727</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>reads</th>\n      <td>0.053185</td>\n      <td>0.409954</td>\n      <td>0.056545</td>\n      <td>0.167755</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>0.999999</td>\n      <td>0.240466</td>\n      <td>0.165700</td>\n      <td>0.302308</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>readers_count</th>\n      <td>0.053182</td>\n      <td>0.409959</td>\n      <td>0.056542</td>\n      <td>0.167748</td>\n      <td>0.999999</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>0.240468</td>\n      <td>0.165699</td>\n      <td>0.302310</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>incoming_link_count</th>\n      <td>0.106176</td>\n      <td>-0.005901</td>\n      <td>0.178403</td>\n      <td>0.015386</td>\n      <td>0.240466</td>\n      <td>0.240468</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>-0.009352</td>\n      <td>0.991238</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>quote_count</th>\n      <td>-0.022958</td>\n      <td>0.120444</td>\n      <td>-0.017490</td>\n      <td>0.091541</td>\n      <td>0.165700</td>\n      <td>0.165699</td>\n      <td>-0.009352</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>0.000815</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>score</th>\n      <td>0.114783</td>\n      <td>0.013525</td>\n      <td>0.191785</td>\n      <td>0.047727</td>\n      <td>0.302308</td>\n      <td>0.302310</td>\n      <td>0.991238</td>\n      <td>0.000815</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\nI find this surprising. Correlations go mostly in the expected directions, but they are lower than I expected. It seems that semantic density as perceived by ethnographer is only weakly correlated to measures like `reads` or  `quote_count`, which arguably represent quality as perceived by participants in the conversation. That said `char_count` is far and away the algorithmic indicator with the strongest covariance with `annotations`. \n\n## Regression\n\nI tried two things.\n\n1. Linear regression of `annotations` over all quality measures (except `readers` and `score`, to avoid collinearity issues), plus 272 dummy variables representing the 272 authors.\n2. Logit regression of `annotations > 0` vs.`annotations==0` over the same set of variables as above.\n\n### Results: linear model \n\n* All user dummy variables are highly significant (t-statistics around `|5| -|10|`9: the probability of a post being annotated depends heavily on who the author is.\n* `char_count` very highly significant, t-statistic = 25.\n* `incoming_link_count` also significant, but only few posts have those, so it is not a universally useful indicator.\n* `reply_count` barely significant.\n* All other variables not significant, including the length of the topic (`posts_in_topic`). This comes as a surprise, as @amelia and I had been informally using it as a proxy of quality. I think what's going on is this: a long topic is almost certain to contain some semantically dense posts, but it is also likely to contain several irrelevant ones. So, as the topic lenghtens, it contains more semantics, but it does not become more semantically *dense*.\n* R-square = 0.36: model only explains 36% of the total variance.\n* Heteroskedastic \u2013 in particular, residuals get larger (the model predicts less well) as the number of annotations in a post gets larger. This could be indicative of non-linearities.\n\n### Results: logit model\n\n* All participants with no annotations, and all participants who authored only one post, annotated or not, are discarded. \n* Once that's done, the dummy variables encoding the identities of authors are no longer significant. \n* `char_count` still highly significant. No other variable is significant at the 99% confidence level. \n* Pseudo R-square = 0.13. Not great explanatory power.\n* Proabaly also heteroskedastic. Much more difficult to test for heteroskedasticity in logit/probit models, so I am not going to go into it until someone requests it.\n\n## Conclusions and next steps\n\nThe length of an individual post (but not of the topic that contains it) has a robust and positive correlation with its semantic density. The long form is simply more conducive to coding. By implication, SSNA projects would do well to encourage thoughtful, long-form exchanges over rapid-fire, chat-like ones. \n\nAs a next step, we could\n\n* verify these results with more data. This means either waiting for the current projects are completed, or (better) selecting a subset of posts that were already processed by ethnographers.\n* attempt training a classifier to predict, based on the data, which posts are more likelyh to be codable.", "created_at": "2020-07-31 14:28:22.451586", "updated_at": "2020-07-31 14:28:22.451586", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1345, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73756, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13148, "post_number": 1, "raw": "You will map organisations that are especially relevant in supporting the initiatives that are being promoted in the communication campaigns.

Getting started</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Prerequisites</h3>\n\nBuilding the site requires a local installation of Node.js and NPM. Some basic knowledge of Git and the command line is required.\n\nTo install Node.js on your local machine, please refer to the official [Node.js guide to installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) on your local system.\n\nNPM will be automatically installed with Node.js.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. Cloning the repository</h3>\n\nDownload the latest version of the webkit by performing the following command in your terminal or by downloading it from the [repository page](http://github.com/edgeryders/webkit_components) in your browser.\n\n```plaintext\ngit clone https://github.com/edgeryders/webkit_components.git webkit\n```\n\nChange directory into the new folder titled 'webkit' (this is the folder where the repository has been downloaded) and install local dependencies with the following command:\n\n```plaintext\ncd webkit && npm install\n```\n\n\n### <h3  id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Running the development server </h3>\n\nWhen dependencies have been installed, you can preview the site locally by running a development server:\n\n```plaintext\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nYou can then preview the site in your browser by visiting ```http://localhost:8080``` in your browser.\n\n> The localhost address may be different depending on your setup, the terminal window will show which address to visit in any case.\n\nWhen running on a local server, you will need to disable Cross Origin Restrictions. The Discourse API will not respond to queries from an unknown source. To disable this restriction:\n\n* In Chrome, use an extension such as [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)\n* In Safari, [enable the develop menu](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/safari/sfri20948/mac) and select 'Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions'\n* For other browsers, search for guides online to Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. Preparing Discourse for webkit content</h3>\n\nYou must be careful to guarantee that webkit content does not spam other users of the site with notifications in their digest e-mails from Discourse, and also does not appear in the \"Latest\" lists of topics. The following instructions provide this:\n\n1. Set up a convention that categories contain either no webkit content at all, or only webkit content.\n\n2. Go to setting [\"default categories muted\" list](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=default%20categories%20muted) and add all categories that contain the webkit content. When saving, choose to apply this historically to all users.\n\n3. Reset the setting \"default categories muted\" and save again. This time, choose to only apply this for the future, *not* historically.\n\n4. Install a Discourse plugin that adds the webkit categories to the list of muted categories whenever a new user account is created. It is best when that plugin's settings allow to list the categories to mute so that listing a top-level category will also mute all its sub-categories automatically (which is not implied when telling Discourse to mute a category). (So far, such a plugin does not yet exist. You might instead use a cron job executing a Ruby console command or a SQL command directly in the database.)\n\n5. Whenever you add a new category or subcategory for webkit content, you have to repeat steps 2 and 3 above to mute it for existing users. For that reason, it is best to only use a single top-level category for all webkit content.\n\n**Explanations.** Webkit content must appear in the \"Latest\" list of tags, at least for the anonymous user, because that is how the webkit fetches its content when displaying a website. When adding a category to the [\"default categories muted\" list](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=default%20categories%20muted), Discourse will also remove all topics in that category from the \"Latest\" lists of categories and of tags (!). That setting will also apply to the anonymous user, so it is not an applicable solution or the webkit will not be able to access its own content. However, when using the per-user lists of muted categories, the behavior is the same, but it does not apply to the anonymous user. That's what the above instructions do.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Configuring</h2>\n\nNow the site is locally installed, you will need to configure it.\n\nConfiguration of a webkit site is set up in the file config.json. To get to it, open the ```src``` folder, then the ```data``` folder, and open the ```config.json``` file in your code editor.\n\nA basic configuration will include a title and site description, you can fill these in the \"config\" section of the JSON file.\n\n```\n \"config\": {\n   \"title\": \"Site Title\",\n   \"description\": \"Site description\"\n  }\n```\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Adding Blocks</h3>\n\nThe blocks object will determine the content of your site and the order of the content. Here is an example of the `Header` block:\n\n```\n\"blocks\": [{\n   \"type\": \"Header\",\n   \"views\": [\n    {\n      \"menu\": {  \n          \"config\": {\n             \"links\": \"id\"\n           }\n       },\n       \"hero\": {  \n          \"config\": {\n             \"template\": \"standard\",\n           },\n           \"title\": \"Webkit Sandbox\",\n           \"text\": \"This is some text for the hero.\"\n           \"image\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://erwebkit.netlify.app/edgeryders.svg\",\n              \"width\": [\"100px\", \"160px\"] \n            },\n            \"buttons\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Link #1\",\n                \"url\": \"#join\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Link #2\",\n                \"url\": \"#strategy\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"text\": \"Link #3\",\n                \"url\": \"#about\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n}]\n```\n\nEach block contains one or more `views` to display content. The header block above, displays the `menu` and `hero` views.\n\n| block   | views                    | \n|---------|--------------------------|\n| header  | hero, menu \n| content | text, image, video, form \n| topics  | list, grid, slider               \n| events  | list, grid, slider                \n| footer  | text, image\n\nFor more on configuring each block, please refer to the [site documentation on Blocks](https://erwebkit.netlify.app/guide/blocks.html).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Adding Views to a Block</h3>\n\nViews are responsible for the presentation of the data in a block.\n\nTo add a view to a block, pass it into the `views` array.\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"Content\",\n  \"id\": \"about\",\n  \"views\": [\n     {\n      \"image\": [{ \"url\": \"https://placekitten.com/540/360\", \"size\": 300 }],\n      \"text\": \"<h3 class='font-bold text-xl mb-3'>About this section</h3><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

This means these two views `text` and `image` will appear side by side on the site.  \n\nThe following text view will take up the full width of the container and appear below the above views.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Changing the UI</h3>\n\nEvery block element can be styled differently in the configuration file.\n\nHere is a list of what can be styled and with which properties. Some knowledge of CSS helps in understanding how these properties work, but is not essential.\n\n| object    | property                                  |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------|\n| container | width, padding, background, margin, class\n| wrapper   | width, padding, background, margin, class \n| title     | width, font, weight, class               \n| text      | font, weight, class                \n| button    | color, border, background, class\n\nTo configure a style for a block, use the `style` object inside the block. Here is an example of the content block with a custom `title`, `text` and `wrapper` style:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"Content\",\n  \"id\": \"about\",\n  \"style\": {\n    \"wrapper\": {\n      \"width\": [\"100%\", \"80%\"],\n      \"padding\": [\"0\", \"30px 0px\"],\n      \"class\": [\"border rounded-lg\"]\n    },\n   \"title\": {\n     \"weight\": [\"bold\", \"normal\"],\n     \"color\": [\"red\", \"black\"]\n   },\n   \"text\": {\n     \"font\": [\"Georgia\", \"Helvetica\"],\n     \"color\": [\"orange\"]\n   }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou'll notice each property is inside an `array`. The first value of the array will be applied to the mobile viewport, the second to the desktop viewport.\n\nIn this case the `title` **font weight** will be `bold` on phones, but `normal` on desktop. If there is only one value in the array, the property will be applied to both desktop and mobile. So the text `color` property will be `orange`, regardless of the viewport.\n\nProperties follow the same logic as CSS. If we look at the padding property for the wrapper, it will have **30px of padding horizontally** and **0px of padding vertically**.\n\nThe `class` property will add css classes to the element. This is is useful for applying Tailwind CSS classes. In this case, the wrapper will be rounded (applying a `border-radius` to the element) and have a `border` of 1px. For more on the range of classes available, see the [Tailwind Documentation here](http://tailwindcss.com).\n\nFor more on styling each block, please refer to the [site documentation on Styling](https://erwebkit.netlify.app/guide/styling).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Deployment</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Deployment via live.edgeryders.eu</h3>\n\nIf you want to publish your website with a domain of the form `example.edgeryers.eu`, the following simplified deployment is possible and our preferred way:\n\n1. Make sure your website is accessible for testing purposes with the following URL, where `{id}` is the topic ID of the Discourse topic used to place the site configuration:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    https://live.edgeryders.eu/{id}\n    ```\n\n2. Some configuration needs to be done on the `live.edgeryders.eu` site to make it aware that requests for your future domain `example.edgeryders.eu` need to be served using a configuration file found in the `edgeryders.eu` Discourse topic `{id}`. \n\nTo do this you will need access to the Netlify account, or to ask someone on the team who does.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. Login to Netlify and click on **live.edgeryders.eu** to get to the site overview\n2. Click on **domain settings**, and add the domain as an **alias domain** to the site.\n3. Go to the webkit directory [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-webkit-directory/13671)\n4. Add the domain to the YAML configuration in the following format:\n\n```\n- id: 14686\n  domain: remote.edgeryders.eu\n```\n\n3. Proceed with the [domain setup](#heading--3-3) steps below. After that, your new website should be ready to use.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Deployment as a standalone website</h3>\n\nIf you are not creating a `subdomain.edgeryders.eu` site, you have to deploy it as a standalone website.\n\n\n#### Building the site for production\n\nOnce you have finished configuring the site, you will want to perform a build. Building will bundle the components into a minified Javascript file, making the site ready to deploy on a server.\n\nTo perform a build, make sure you are not running a development server (hit `Control-C` to stop the server if this is the case). Type in the following command into the command line:\n\n```plaintext\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis process will take about a minute, after which the the production ready version of the site will be created in a directory called `dist` at the root of the project. \n\nThis folder contains all the elements of the site, it can be uploaded via FTP to a server that serves HTML or to a service such as Netlify. To deploy to Netlify follow the next steps.\n\n\n#### Deploying to Netlify\n\nLogin to the Edgeryders account on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). If you are a project manager, look for the login credentials in our accounts topic or contact @owen, @hugi or @matthias. \n\nOnce logged in scroll to the bottom of the page where you will see this box:\n\n![49|690x122](upload://6CZpkRM0L1EEgH9sdRlhTBt6706.png) \n\nFrom your file browser drag the `dist` folder to this box. \n\nNetlify will begin the process of publishing the site. You will be redirected to the site information page and a domain will be automatically assigned to the site. You can change the domain by clicking on **Domain Settings**:\n\n![48|390x205](upload://orjL7oTf6Tg8MSdYqgfOGutt25b.png)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Domain setup</h3>\n\nIndependent of how you deployed the site, you will want to give it a proper domain:\n\n1. Point your domain `example.edgeryders.eu` via CNAME to the `something-something.netlify.tld` sub-domain where the site is available right now. That is `erlive.netlify.com` when using the first deployment method described above. For more details, see the instructions on Netlify for [adding a custom domain](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/).\n\n2. Add your domain `example.edgeryders.eu` to the CORS whitelist on the Discourse platform. For edgeryders.eu, contact @hugi or @matthias to add your domain to the [edgeryders.eu CORS whitelist](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=cors%20origins). \n\n    Without this step, queries from this domain's Javascript code would be blocked by Discourse, preventing components from displaying data from Discourse.\n\n3. Wait up to 10 minutes for your DNS hoster to update their nameservers with the new configuration your provided. (Do not try to visit `example.edgeryders.eu` before, as otherwise the failed DNS lookup would be cached by your ISP's DNS and you'd be unable to visit that site for hours or even up to two days even though it is available for others already.)\n\nAt this point, your site should be up and working.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4.

Great majority of the population today cannot afford quality foods (and I am not talking about caviar and truffles).

A couple pays easily 300...and that's budget food. \n\n[quote=\"angelo, post:50, topic:14326\"]\nJust don\u2019t think about that system, think bottom-up. Local farmers organizing is key.

Both need to be done, bottom and the top.\nBig support is needed at the top too, hopefully the new subsidies covering ecological production will create new initiatives.\n\n[quote=\"angelo, post:50, topic:14326\"]\nOne aspect missing in your argument. Decreasing the cost of local and quality food: what is the impact on the farmers\u2019 revenue and livelihood? Just to remind that this aspect must be part of the equation\n[/quote]\nActually it wasn't an argument at all, just a short summary of my thinking...which could be faulty as well :slight_smile:. If I was making an argument I would elaborate much more for sure.\n\nI am well aware of that aspect and the balance needed there Angelo. Croatia specifically is in a weird situation, as prices are way higher than the actual living standard can support (especially on the coast). Kuna is linked to Euro and is kept artificially quite high, not reflecting the real state of the economy. That's way above my pay grade so I will not go into that.\nI wrote [elsewhere](https://edgeryders.eu/t/local-food-will-be-priceless-how-do-we-fight-big-agribusinesses-and-talk-to-farmers-to-produce-in-traditional-ways/14651/5) about that a bit more. \nThere is no one simple solution. We have to reshape our society. Having people migrate back to abandoned rural regions is necessary. There are many places all over Europe where people cannot even have businesses as there are no workers available. I know many municipalities like that in Croatia. Of course, there are solutions. I traveled all over Europe and saw a lot of good practices and I think outside of the box. Most people who grew up there and never went further than the nearby bigger city do not see those solutions or cannot implement them. The fact is also that the population in many EU countries has been losing the buying power. I remember how it was when I just arrived to Brussels...the prices of everything go up every year, new taxes are introduced...and salaries go up by a miserable amount. When I say that quality food needs to be cheap or affordable, I don't mean that everything should be taken on by the producer.\n\nI have spent very long time in people's homes, both in well developed rural communities (those in proximity to bigger cities like Karlovac and Zagreb municipalities) and in Croatia's poorest communities...spent a lot of time talking with those people to figure out how can I really help them. I did also a 3 month market research on the subject. I shared it with some LAGs so the result was they adopted my conclusions to their needs and created their local development strategies. I also started a big project based on it. The project was an answer to real needs of the population. It turned out to be too big for me at that time and, due to my inexperience (made some costly mistakes) and lack of funding, I had to stop it. Actually I had ways to fund it but I did not like that I had to become indebted to a political party to do it...i stayed out of politics and corruption for so many years so that was one compromise I wasn't ready to make. Too bad, as the product was, and still is, much needed.\n\nNext year I will start it again but, this time I will do it in just 1 municipality...keep it small.

People could create rituals to mark the start and end of the workday, and companies could make clear they don\u2019t expect messages to be answered immediately.\n\n### Judge performance, not the schedule\n\nPeople have learned that they\u2019re evaluated in part on the [number of hours they spend](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/upshot/women-long-hours-greedy-professions.html) in the office. To adapt, managers should be very clear about expectations for the work assigned and when it\u2019s due, researchers said \u2014 then leave the \u201chow\u201d up to the workers and not worry about following the traditional 9-to-5 schedule.\n\n### Slash meetings\n\nDecide which meetings you really need, and replace some with Slack conversations. Keep meetings short and small, with breaks in between, and make them optional with detailed notes for those who can\u2019t attend.\n\n### Connect colleagues\n\nPeople miss office friendships, and these often lead to better work. In addition to having video chats to catch up, co-workers have sent letters or packages in the mail or met up for socially distanced walks. Some suggest calling co-workers just to check in.\n\n### Include everyone\n\nRemote work can lead to feeling excluded \u2014 without daily contact, people might reach out only to those they know best, and it can be harder to assert oneself on a video chat or conference call. Forming in-person relationships in the office has been shown to be helpful for expanding opportunities [to women and people of color](https://hbr.org/2018/08/how-women-of-color-get-to-senior-management). It can also be especially helpful for workers new to a company or to the work force.\n\nCompanies can increase the frequency of meetings between mentors and mentees, researchers and executives said, and people should become more conscious about collaborating with people they don\u2019t know well.\n\nIn many ways, companies have found, remote work can be *more* inclusive. A brainstorming session on Slack is easier for many people to join than an in-person meeting. Events or employee group meetings may be less intimidating to some workers when they\u2019re held online. And networking over video chat or the phone is accessible to more people than golf retreats or after-work drinks.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that widespread remote work will last a long time, and many people may never return to the office full time. These tips could improve working from home now and in the future.\n[/quote]\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/upshot/remote-work-tips.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=The%20Upshot", "created_at": "2020-07-31 16:54:12.354945", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 22:39:18.893616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 565, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 45.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3911, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3878, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The Open Ethnography project is <a href=\"/t/the-rockefeller-foundation-to-support-edgeryders-in-building-an-ethnography-of-stewardship/3820\">starting</a>, particularly the software design of which Matthias is currently in charge.\u00a0This will be a brief meeting where those interested can go through a short recap of what the project is about, timeline and what the requirements should be for the software.\n\nLearn more: <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">project group on Edgeryders\u00a0</a>\n\nPinging @Alberto, <a href=\"/u/inga_popovaite\">@Inga_Popovaite</a>, @Matthias, @mariabyck, @ireinga and anyone who is interested..\n\nIf you're coming, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/events/c7jbutaes0egke7am3facmab7os?authkey=CPeQ6KjR6-_t8AE\">join the hangout space</a>\u00a0at 11 AM CET.\n\nDate: 2014-11-07 10:00:00 - 2014-11-07 10:00:00, Europe/Bucharest Time.", "created_at": "2014-11-06 11:39:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.482505", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 147, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76319, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13475, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I think we need good copywriting to convey is that they are not plug and play in their current state.

Advising on processes, trying to ride the coat-tails of top-down theatrics ('so-called' governance) by selling services that advise on 'how to'\u00a0rather than to actually do, while claiming to 'get shit done', will draw interest only in so far as seeing through the fascade, and this is all it is when nothing is actually being done.\n\nWith UnMon there is a chance to change that reality, from the 'process-pushing' to actual output, real social value. Its very easy for a project like Edgeryders to be seen from above (i.e from those to whom you seek to sell services, or in the least by those upper houses\u00a0whom Edgeryders seek to mediate between) \u00a0as a kind of 'Ship of Fools' for the cap-in-hand precariat. In the absence of evidence to the contrary this will remain the case.\u00a0\n\nEdgeryders, and the 15m/Occupy/Las Indignados crew\u00a0(and in general those whose efforts are based at the meta-level, without active substance on the ground, in the field, in the forge, growing or creating actual things) are in dire need of actualization into real organic processes. I don't want to go into the abstractus of organic practical philsophical reasoning as to why this is as it is, but it is definitely the case. Without roots things don't grow. Use material to approach the material, value is representative of exchange of the actual.\u00a0\n\nThings have a definite way. If you approach via meta-interface then things will so remain, no doubt about it. If you can do work at the community level that is productive, starting simply, then the rest can follow from there.\u00a0\n\nI would hope that the plan, Matthias, for your book, would involve the doing of the thing and writing about the doing of\u00a0the thing rather than beginning with the 'how' of the thing.\n\nMy intention here isn't to annoy. You each do great work, (yes 'DO'!) in specific areas, and that counts- for those areas. The rest comes in the doing. UnMon is the place for ER to come to flower, and from there to bare fruit. It will not be by abstract information, meta-level services, or consultancy, but by the organic setting, 'in situ', that people can bare witness to how these things develop from Practice.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-05 18:32:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.519341", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 427, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73070, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13025, "post_number": 2, "raw": "\n[quote=\"martin, post:1, topic:13025\"]\nWhy are the figures that describe them so hard to grasp?

I also believe that small changes, such as minor reductions in carbon emissions, are not the answer. True change is disruptive and often comes from the outside.

Pietro Speroni, an Italian mathematician I know has developed a software called <a href=\"http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php\">Vilfredo </a>(after Vilfredo Pareto). It assists a group of people to converge on the answer on an open question by an iterative process: each person proposes an answer, then everybody \"votes\" to agree or disagree on answers. The algorithm then extracts only the answers that are in the Pareto front of the discussion: the Pareto front contains all answers that are non Pareto-dominated. Answer A dominates answer B if everybody that agrees with B also agrees with A, and at least one more person agrees with A but not with B. In such a situation, the algorithm drops B (dominated) and keeps A as part of the Pareto front... unless there is a proposal C that has the agreement of everybody who agrees with A and at least one more person.\n\nThe algorithm also finds out who the \"key people\" are. Key people are participants that, if they just could agree to some proposal X, would allow the Pareto front to be drastically simplified. The software asks these people to rewrite proposal X, keeping its spirit but in such a way that they can live with it. The trick is to shrink the Pareto front at each iteration.\n\nThe system is quite clever, but it has important limitations. An important one: ideological differences never converge, so \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" proposals would never simplify each other off the Pareto front. Nevertheless, Pietro's intuition of a mathematically fair decision making tool is worth pursuing some more, methinks.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-16 16:03:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.828364", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 295, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17637], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69044, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12309, "post_number": 18, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:14, topic:12309\"]\nif people here think that this is a nice long-term investment to make\n[/quote]\n\n\nI have no idea about that whatsoever. Generally speaking, I like Taleb's \"read the classics\" maxim, and I believe it applies to software too. It works like this: only spend time reading stuff that is at least 300 years old, because it has been selected by evolution so that it is unlikely to disappear. If you know your Seneca or your Plato, you can still pass for a learned person in 2100, whereas investing in, say, Liu Cixin is unlikely to yield the same results. \n\nI know next to nothing about software, but it seems to me that lower level stuff takes longer to go out of fashion. So, a long-term investment makes more sense if it is on lower levels. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:14, topic:12309\"]\nI don\u2019t want to invest *any* precious lifetime or brain capacity into a software that we plan to abandon later\n[/quote]\n\nThat's not how we make progress!

So what I mean is this; while we can do much with only Tulip, we will always need some other database to handle getting data that relates to some selected entity in the graph. While we could often get that straight from Discourse, it is often specific to the loaded dataset \u2013 like listing the posts and comments of that user in this particular SSN. \n\nI'm not completely sure though why the Tulip graphs are built by first building the Neo4j graph and then building Tulip graphs on command, but I suspect that it is something like this: Because each selection of a subset of nodes actually requires a new tulip graph to be built on demand. I suspect that the graph that describes the social interactions of subset B of SSNA A can not be directly inferred from the Tulip graph of A, right? And since Discourse actually does not contain any primary data on wether two users have interacted, the social graph needs to be constructed from scratch for any given subset of the SSN. It is probably prohibitively resource intensive to do this by calling the Discourse API or even relational database every time you want to calculate a new social graph.

We share this goal with many in our global network and have received enthusiastic signs of support.\n\nIn 2019, Edgeryders signed a Memorandum of Understanding with our partners at Blivande, in Stockholm, and Fondazione per l'Innovazione Urbana in Bologna. We called it The Reef Network. It was just meant  to seal our work for that year, but, to our surprise, we received requests from several people and organizations that wanted to be a part of it. So, we decided to open it up, turning it into a formal alliance. Anybody can join it, for the purpose of supporting each other around a common goal: redefining urban living in a low- or net-zero carbon emission world. \n\n# The Reef Network is now open for joining by organisations and companies, and individuals. Sign the Memorandum of Understanding!\n\nWe have set up a Memo of Understanding - a formalised intention to join forces and commit to mutual learning and sharing. No legal obligations are attached to this memorandum. \n\nHere are the relevant sections:\n\n> 2. Purpose and scope \nThe purpose of this MOU for joining The Reef Network is to establish a framework for the parties to coordinate their activities aimed at redefining urban living in a low- or net-zero carbon emission world. \n>3. Background \nAs climate change accelerates, so do policies aimed at facing the challenge it poses. At the time of writing (April 2020), the available evidence indicates that our civilization is not on track to stay within the +1.5\u00b0C limit recommended by the IPCC. \nIndependently of this, the parties have undertaken, in the cities where they operate, projects that reflect on modern urban life, and even attempt to improve it in several dimensions; health, culture, work-life balance, social cohesion. \n>4. Commitment. The parties commit to: \n\u25cf A concerted effort to push their respective projects in the direction of low- or net-zero carbon emission. They acknowledge this will require innovation, both in the sense of new technology for urban living and in the sense of new behavior for inhabitants of cities. They acknowledge \u201ctraditional middle class\u201d lifestyle might be incompatible with a net-zero emission civilization. They acknowledge that new lifestyles might emerge that are no less attractive than traditional middle class, just different. \n\u25cf A continued dialogue to exchange information, explore possible common actions (such as common innovation projects, conferences, exhibitions, or other events), and exploit as many synergies as they can spot. \n\u25cf Full transparency of the above. Information related to technology (such as schematics, instructables, prototypes, software code), content (such as texts, videos, pictures) and action (such as strategic documents, action plans and so on) are to be published with open licenses, and remain in the informational commons. \n>5. Means of coordination\nThe parties agree to coordinate mostly online, through tools such as digital fora, wikis, conference calls, deployed as appropriate. \n>6. Naming\nWhile each space has its own name, the parties agree to use the name \u201cThe Reef\u201d to denote the alliance of spaces. This could be further specified as needed (eg. The Reef Alliance, The Reef Network and so on). \n> 7. Extension to third parties \nThird parties who find themselves in syntony with this MOU\u2019s purpose and scope, and who are willing to take on the same commitments as The Reef, Edgeryders, and other signatories, are in principle welcome to become a part of the network by signing an addendum to the MOU. \n>8. Duration \nThis MOU comes into force at its signing date, and expires on December 31st 2020. It is renewable yearly, by means of a simple communication from each party that wishes to renew it to the other partners. \n>9. Opt-out \nParties can opt out of this MOU at any time, by simply communicating to other parties they wish to do so. \n\n\nSignatories so far (as of 25/06/2020):\n1. The Reef ASBL - association (Belgium) \n2. Edgeryders OU - company limited by guarantee, non-profit (Estonia)\n3. Blivande Id\u00e9er AB - limited company (Sweden)\n4.

Both tasks were completed. The glossary is composed of 27 entries that cover a broad conceptual terrain. The idea was to create a common platform of understanding across the interdisciplinary research team of concepts which may have different meaning in different traditions or which meaning is not sufficiently clear.  \n\nI have not seen the glossary (it is not on the website yet), but I imagine some of our 300 codes relate somehow to one or the other of the 27 glossary terms. So, here's the idea:\n\n* Map ethno codes onto glossary terms. This mapping is of course not based on WP  data, but it would be an authorial effort, based on the expert knowledge of the POPREBEL consortium.\n* This mapping allows us to add glossary terms to the SSN as parent nodes of ethno codes. \n* Ethno codes are already connected to each other by co-occurrence edges.\n* Which means we can easily induce a \"children nodes co-occurrence network\" connecting the glossary terms. \n\nSuch a network can be interpreted as the association pattern across the glossary terms as it emerges in the POPREBEL conversation. More collective intelligence, but now the grounded theory approach is combined with the methods deployed to create the glossary. \n\n* What connection patterns are the people in the conversation seeing? \n* Do they resonate with the POPREBEL team? \n* Are there omissions (important glossary terms that have no children nodes in the conversation \u2013 no one is talking about them)? Why?\n* Are there many important codes that do not map onto any glossary term? Does this imply a divergence between how the conversation vis-a-vis credentialed expert see populism?\n\nFormally, this is the application of a multilayer network approach to semantic social networks.

Equally not the type of experience I expected from year working towards a beautiful idea. \u00a0I will save my thoughts, lessons and mistakes for a time when they can be productively compiled and reflected upon.\n\nThe only way I can recognise such a pledge of responsibility is for a role shift, if you're prepared to take the role of unAbbott in the project I welcome your lead and the opportunity to offer exhortation from a distance.\u00a0\n\nThis is not meant as provocation but rather the desire to seek clarification and what I recognise as a desperate need for the continuation of the unMonastery; that those directing from outside the project to experience the process first hand in order to better put an idea into practice at scale.\n\nOver the course of the last 2 years many of us built an enormous belief around what the unMonastery could and should be, the expectations have been set high and continuously reinforced \u00a0by the PR surrounding the project. When this idea was first proposed we said 2 years at a minimum, we cheated ourselves in agreeing to 4 months in a context where guarantees, resource and clarity are scarce. The pressure of all that work, expectation and PR has fallen in a very meaningful way on each of the people trying their best to produce the best work they are capable - in very few moments has that work been recognised or respected.\u00a0\n\nThere are two things to acknowledge in respect to this, the notion of \"Community First\" and the basis on which individuals submitted themselves to the project: \"Other Monasteries have historically also included <strong>features such as hierarchy</strong>, male only and submission to a fixed religious ideology. These are features that we're not interested in reproducing, which is the reason for the 'un' in unMonastery.\"\n\nI respect and broadly agree with much of what has been stated here, except the fact that the details are interesting and important, because they reflect people's needs and emotions. Whilst I have no interest in the politics, I do have a very real vested interested in ensuring the well being and health of individuals - I didn't sign up to this in order to reanimate in another context the same tyranny and alienation that is present in existing workplaces. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-22 12:09:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:25.244598", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 450, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81067, "user_id": 3456, "topic_id": 13926, "post_number": 30, "raw": "test_post 1", "created_at": "2020-07-27 23:32:07.900715", "updated_at": "2020-07-27 23:32:07.900715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59896, "user_id": 5092, "topic_id": 9878, "post_number": 39, "raw": "I love this from a glance, and I look forward to reading the whole thing.

But in order to see more collaboration happen we need to understand if and how collaboration between people driving projects results in direct benefits for them. Another condition for collaboration to happen is that people have enough insight into one another's work, values, approaches and challenges to see where they have overlapping interests and complimentary strengths. So we build a repository of case studies so people can learn about one another.\u00a0\n\nThe objective of the \"thought pieces\" are to bridge gaps between what institutions are supporting, and what people driving different grassroots/innovative projects outside mainstream are working on (and how they are going about doing it). Gaps we are looking at are not the ones between institutions and grassroots, but also between different projects that currently not living up to their full potential for different reasons. How do we approach this? That is what we need a shared analytical framework: people contribute thought pieces based on applying the analytical framework on submitted case studies.\n\nAsk again/more if anything is still missing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-06 18:19:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.949804", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 270, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2566, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86527, "user_id": 5479, "topic_id": 14632, "post_number": 23, "raw": "Looking ahead, jotting down a few more speakers, esp on issues that are underserved or overlooked by current threads:\n\n* [Sarah Chander](https://edri.org/about-us/our-team/), Senior Policy Advisor @ EDRi: her recent work has been focused on the [decolonising process for digital rights](https://digitalfreedomfund.org/the-first-steps-to-decolonise-digital-rights/) in the EU.

It has almost been a month since I joined Edgeryders. It is wonderful to discuss and connect with like-minded people who together want to make the world a better place to live. I am very much optimistic that we can make a difference and create positive activities.\n\nDoes your work define you? Mine was not. I was trapped inside four office walls along with my frustration and no matter what I did, it was never good enough. I gathered all my courage and decided to quit. Sure, it could have created trouble as courage does not pay my bills, but my family supported me to the most. I also consider myself lucky to be born in a not so economically troubled family. I have met many people who hate their job but have no option than to tolerate it.\n\nDeveloping countries like Nepal have so many distinct problems. The three problems which I want to address the most are: lack of resources, lack of trust in the potential of the young and lack of alternative thinking. Nepal somehow never tried to utilize its local resources and always relied on what it doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s always about the grass being greener on the other side. Trust in young minds is rare, even big organizations seek only big names but not big ideas. According to their own assumptions, \u201cyoung people lack commitment\u201d.\n\nBut as they say, \u201ccrisis creates opportunity\u201d. Coffee Arabica can be grown in most hilly parts of Nepal. Nepal is an agricultural country which has always followed traditional farming. I was born and raised in Kathmandu but my dad is from Arghakachi (a small rural village with very good potential for coffee farming). The land in Arghakachi is mostly used to cultivate rice and barley. I would like to introduce coffee farming to the farmers of this village. Coffee farming tends to require less effort and earn more profit. Due to lack of awareness, farmers just don't know about the possibilities of harvesting coffee.\n\nIt is very hard to find fresh Nepalese coffee in a local market. There are a few brands but it is very expensive for local people to buy it because of unfair trade. Farmers don\u2019t get an appropriate price either, which discourages them from coffee farming.  It is a necessity to create a market for the farmers where they can get a fair price.\n\n## Project Idea \u201cOpenVillage House Kathmandu\u201d\n\nI really liked the concept of \u201cOpenVillage Houses\u201d as it will bring people together. Most of the young people of Kathmandu lack connection with the outer world. I went to Vietnam in July where I decided to stay at hostel rather than a hotel, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The hostel offers a bed and breakfast service, along with their own coffee shop where they sell local Vietnamese coffee, like Coffee Saigon.\n\nThe hostel offers long term stay both for foreign and Vietnamese students on a shared kitchen basis. I really liked the concept of it, as this way Vietnamese people can get connected to foreign people and together they can learn and share their knowledge inclusively and enjoy cultural diversity. I think this is a very practical way of learning.\n\nOpenVillage House Kathmandu will be a co-working and co-housing space along with a coffee shop and an own coffee manufactory. The idea is also to create a connection hub where people from different backgrounds and culture can connect over ideas and build a network for the greater good.\n\n## How it will operate\n\nI want to initiate an idea which incorporates both a co-housing / co-working space along with a coffee roastery and a coffee shop.\n\n- *Co-Housing*\n- *Co-Working*\n- *Coffee Shop*\n- *Coffee Roastery*\n\n### Co-Housing\n\nKathmandu is the capital city of Nepal. Lots of students come to Kathmandu to continue their further studies. As rent in the city area with adequate facilities is expensive, students have a hard time finding a reasonable place to stay for the long term. In Nepal, lots of colleges don\u2019t have student dormitories or hostels. Students have a very hard time finding a space to rent. Nepal is an interesting country to travel if you are an adventurous person. Most tourists are here for trekking to Everest Base Camp, but Nepal also welcomes lots of foreign students from abroad for short / long term research or volunteer purposes. In my own experience, the foreign students also have a hard time finding appropriate housing to stay for the long term. Both problems can be addressed and solved with the OpenVillage House. We could accommodate both types of students by providing a proper place to stay with a shared kitchen. We can charge an appropriate rent along with utility costs for Internet, electricity and drinking water, in an exciting environment. This will help local students build networks with students from all over the world and share their local knowledge.\n\n### Co-Working\n\nCo-working spaces are very new to Nepal. In Kathmandu, there are only a couple co-working spaces. Since start-ups don\u2019t have their own office, co-working spaces are popular among young people. The co-working space can also be ideal for students, and a hub to meet and discuss ideas. \n\n### Coffee Shop\n\nThe Open House will have its own coffee shop which will serve freshly roasted coffee at an affordable price to local people. Coffee culture is getting famous in Nepal. The coffee shop will also be creative about utilizing local food items as snacks alongside the coffee. This can help to market Nepalese coffee that is roasted on-site. Also, the coffee shop can employ local people.\n\n### Coffee Roastery\n\nThe coffee beans will be collected from villages (Palpa, Gulmi) including Arghakachi, using direct trade connections. We will use hulling and sorting machines to process the coffee into clean green beans, which allows us to buy even from very small-scale farmers who can't process it on their own, and relieves other farmers from the work-intensive and low-wage activity of sorting the beans. Afterwards, the coffee beans will be roasted and both sold locally and made export ready on site (Packing, Labeling so on).\n\nExporting roasted coffee is not usually done, but works due to the special circumstances in Nepal: amounts smaller than a full container load can only be transported by air cargo to Europe, which is expensive, but happens to be fast enough for roasted coffee to arrive fresh at consumers (namely, in about a week).\n\nThe coffee will also be exported to European Union countries, utilizing the \"fair and direct\"  marketing scheme and the experience @matthias collected about that (see [here](/t/id/6014)). This needs innovative solutions for marketing and logistics \u2013 because to ensure that, for fairness, more than half of the final sales price goes to the coffee farmers, marketing can't happen in Europe with European wages. Instead, we will experiment with ways to have the marketing activities and nearly all of the packaging and handling done inside Nepal. Our first bright idea for this is to market to caf\u00e9s in European countries. This has several advantages: they value quality over price, they accept commercial communication in English, they need amounts that make national parcel shipment (after air cargo) feasible, and they have a good use for the unique story of fair and direct trade that the coffee comes with. We would include leaflets and info material with the coffee that they can show to their guests, this way acting as a free marketing hub as guests might also start to order the same coffee.\n\nFor logistics, an innovative idea to reduce the price markup is that we will prepare the coffee inside Nepal for national parcel shipment inside Europe \u2013 basically, order, pay and print parcel labels over Internet. This way, the only activity needed by partners in Europe is to pay customs, unpack the air cargo shipment and hand the contained parcels to a national parcel carrier.\n\nFinally, because of the direct trade connection without intermediaries, it will also be possible to sell this Nepali coffee in the attached coffee shop for a price that is affordable for locals in Nepal (ca. 900 NPR/kg instead of 1700-2000 NPR/kg). This should help to quickly become a well-known name here in Kathmandu.\n\nAny Suggestions? :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-09-04 15:59:06.687236", "updated_at": "2018-01-19 15:26:24.593947", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1409, "wiki": false, "reads": 52, "score": 1517.4, "like_count": 12, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 3799, 1935, 3812, 5, 3804, 3613, 3599, 4056, 4040, 3293, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87674, "user_id": 5059, "topic_id": 14632, "post_number": 60, "raw": "Yes, it will be on platform, just like Anton's.

Let me compare notes here. I'll need to say a couple of things about myself. I come from an <em>extremely </em>stable social environment. I, my parents, my grandparents and their parents were all born in the same region of Italy (Emilia Romagna). Of my classmates in high school, I am the only one living more than 30 kms away from the school building. I moved out of town during university; I lived a couple of years in the UK in 1990s; went back to Italy to be in a band, but ended up relocating to Milano in 2001; moved to France last year, and\u00a0 now I am planning my next move - Brussels, two months from now. So, where I come from, I am seen as very restless.\n\nHere is where similarities end. I don't really recognize myself in the attitude of \"oh, well, anything goes\". Adaptation is clearly a big part of it. But for me, in order to live a happy and meaningful life, there is another part, and that is impact: being part of some kind of project that the community where I live has for itself. I like to express this saying that, when I live in a city, ideally I would want to know the mayor personally. \"Knowing the mayor\" stands for being in dialog with the place and its people, recognized as a member of the community (albeit a weird one with a foreign surname) and somebody the community itself can work with. I phantasize of moving to some small town in the south of Italy with a platoon of nerds and tech people and connect it (the town) to flows of conversation, projects, and company-founding that it had not previously been a part of.\n\nIt goes back to the light/heavy dichotomy of Kunderanian fame, I guess. Trouble is, \"heavy\" people like me tend to stay still. Heavy people moving about is somewhat new, and we have not quite figured it out yet.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-10 08:36:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:39.811324", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84000, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14314, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-09-30 11:07:40.088141", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 11:07:40.088141", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83996, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14314, "post_number": 2, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-09-30 11:06:55.441192", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 11:06:55.441192", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76013, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13183, "post_number": 40, "raw": "Hello @schmudde, welcome!

This did not surprised us. Others were naturally more tuned. The dialogue was still interesting.\n\nWith this group, which we imagine could progressively enlarge, we would like to launch a \"working group\" on Opencare with a twofold aim:\n\na) to nurture a city-wide debate about \u201copen\u201d in the welfare provision system of our context from a policy making-perspective;\n\nb) to identify together the \u201csandbox\u201d to test something new, taking in account the experimentation that we are implementing locally, in collaboration with WeMake - @Cristina; @Costantino - and maybe starting from some embryo of existing innovation in the local welfare\n\nFrom September we\u2019ll focus on the streams of work I've mentioned above:\n\na) a working day on OpenCare (January 2017) which should be attended by policy makers and strategic stakeholders dealing with innovation in public policies (among which Fondazione Cariplo and Fondazione Mattei and other key-actors in the milanese network of care)\n\nb) a series of open meetings aimed at discussing a \u201cpolicy prototype\u201d or other concrete outputs of the OpenCare project, which will involve the above mentioned \"working group\" and other interested actors.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you updated!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-01 10:48:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.667518", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74588, "user_id": 1877, "topic_id": 13023, "post_number": 28, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:9, topic:13023\"]\nWhat was needed was a first mover: \u201cI am going to do this, no matter what\u201d.

The government gave 24h for people to relocate, we took advantage and very quickly swapped our city flat for another rented space in a town that has potential for what we were discussing before (rural co-living with some resilience when it come to food and energy). Friends were already first movers in a sense, only they were making their own home here, not focusing on the communal aspect; so now we can explore the possibility to expand on that with them, by being physically on site while still working remotely. Ideally we'll need to attract more families/people for it to work, but for now we can get a better *\"pitch\"* together - as you sort of suggested - by going through the concrete steps of creating our home first.

A lot of the times it is hard for others to know how to find our participate in our projects, let along back them....\n\n<strong>One the more difficult challenges in trying to collaborate with others around addressing a problem is that we seldom have enough time, or opportunities, to explore one anothers perspectives. </strong>This is a huge loss because every one of us has the kind of lived, deep knowledge that is impossible for anyone else to have because, well, every individual is unique. As are his or her perspectives on issues. However it is not enough to just have access to alot of different perspectives. In order to be able to align our work and interests we need a process to connect the dots between these different experiences, and to reach a shared understanding of the space we are trying to navigate.\n\n<strong>So we thought it would be helpful to look at individual projects with a bit of distance, relating them to bigger issues or goals that are relevant to many people. </strong>\n\nLast year, In the context of a post 2015 Development agenda, also known as what comes after the Millenium Goals, UNDP held a global online consultation called World We Want. They asked citizens \u201cWhat would make your future better?\u201d and engaged almost two million worldwide. A number of priority themes were identified, and we think it would be helpful to explore what our experiences and initiatives tell us about those themes.\n\nTo participate, pick the country you are most familiar with, pick one topic that resonates with you and think about how it affects or is affected by your work and life.\n\nWhat questions are you left with and would like to try to answer with the help of others?\n\nSubmit your reflections as a post below, however big or small. Don't be shy about their not being \"complete\", these are hard questions and we are trying to make sense of them together...\n\n[Embed html code with interactive visualisation (click country, then

I've also for the past several years been working on a digital technology project called Jellyswitch, that is a mobile app solution to help manage co-working spaces that's being used at Co-Work Tahoe as well as a few other places.\n\nCo-Work Tahoe was founded in order to allow professionals to work from Lake Tahoe. It's a small mountain town, a ski community and summer vacation spot, but there is a serious need for the economy to be more diverse in order to not be so susceptible to the swings of tourism. And we are seeing that pretty significantly right now during this current pandemic. Six years ago we set out to create a really vibrant space that would allow for that type of community to develop in the Tahoe region. We renovated the building in a district that the local jurisdiction was also trying to revitalize, and so we have brought a lot of great energy and people that spend money at lunches and the local shops.  \n\nPre-pandemic numbers, we were looking at a community of about 150 professionals across a really broad and diverse range of industries. Anything from, the software developer, the typical freelancer that you think of so frequently with co-working, to non-profits, environmental consultants, architects, CPAs, our journalists. It's really neat to see that level of diversity in industries in our small town.\n\nOne of the issues we've seen with the community is that people tend to be transient, but if they can get those really great human connections in their workplace, then we can actually retain them much longer. So we're able to connect them in with people that they may want to go mountain biking with, or skiing with, but also with non-profits they may want to get involved with and support. They may meet other parents that have children in schools, and so they begin building that web and that fabric when they start working at Co-Work Tahoe, and they become very vibrant members of our local South Lake Tahoe community, which is greatly needed.\n\nOne of the great things about co-working is that you can facilitate these connections in a way, professionally, that is different from a traditional corporate structure working on a corporate campus. And t's great to see how people become inspired by one another professionally by learning about each others different fields and contracts of work. I think that helps to create this emergent community that focuses on the entire person, not just their work persona.\n\nWe have very robust firewalls and protective systems in place, and the ability to set up individual networks if people need them. We have the most robust broadband and wifi signal you can get in town, which when you get snowstorms that can drop 10 feet of snow on you, is pretty important. \n\nWe largely closed our physical space during lockdown. There are a small handful of companies that work from our space that are essential, and we have one PPE supplier, and so it was critical for them to be able to continue operations. We made sure that the space was still accessible for them, and that it was safe and cleaned frequently. It was actually fairly simple for us as we are a full-time locked facility as it is, and we use an access control system that all of our members have access to through their mobile apps. \n\nIn the weeks immediately following the shutdown orders, we did jump on and try to make sure that all of our members were participating on Slack, or on our social media channel, and we started hosting a number of Zoom virtual meetings to check in with people and see how they were doing. But after the first few weeks it became pretty clear that most of our members actually weren't asking for more of those coffee breaks or happy hours. I think people got Zoomed-out really quickly, and we didn't want to add to that. The way that we were able to support our community was actually by backing off, and so I think that was actually really interesting to see.\n\nThere's still a lot of anxiety and apprehension. Being a tourist community,\t we are seeing an influx of people, and frankly that does concern me quite a bit as we're hoping that we don't see a surge in cases, particularly serious ones. But again, being a locked co-working space with a highly professional clientele, we've been able to mitigate a lot of the risks. Even before the governor of California mandated face masks in public and in businesses, we already had that implemented as one of our reopening guidelines.\n\nAt the beginning of June, we cut back on about 50% of our open desks. We double checked all of our ventilation systems. We have a lot of windows, we have high ceilings, there's really good airflow throughout all of our systems. A majority of our space is small private offices, and so because of the way that our building was designed to flow people around the building as it was, we've actually been able to feel really good about inviting people back to the space, because they are primarily in private spaces or very, very spread out if they are in the open desk space.\n\nEverybody's wearing face coverings in common spaces and the adoption has been 100%. We have hand sanitizer stations, we've got additional cleaning protocols, and all of our kitchen stuff is now spread way out so there's not the normal clustering around the coffee machine that we used to have. \n\nWe still have quite a few people that are still working from home, or maybe coming in part-time. But again, one of the key things that we did in designing this space and this business model is in providing flexibility. The most interesting development since reopening is we are seeing an influx of new full-time residents to Lake Tahoe. They are actually relocating their families, now that they can work remote, to somewhere with a better quality of life.\n\nThe relationship building is going to take longer than it would before because we're not doing any events. We used to host member's lunches or breakfasts fairly frequently, and we aren't doing those types of things. But we'll spend even more time than we did before making sure that new members feel comfortable and welcome in the space and in the community.\n\nWe run our entire space off of the Jellyswitch mobile app. One of the things that we require right now as part of our new opening guidelines is we're being very strict on using the access control system, so we know how many people have walked in the door each day and I can see who's using the spacing, as well as reserving meeting rooms. We have a protocol where we are leaving a passing period in between meeting rooms to allow for cleaning and for ventilation, and an announcement feature that sends push notifications out to all members, which has been useful in terms of updating everybody on safety policies and procedures around mask wearing. It's been good to see tools like Jellyswitch are being used to even further support not only the safety aspects but the human needs of the space.\n\nThis pandemic has really accelerated the timeline on remote work, as many, many companies have had to quickly adopt work-from-home policies and stick with them for a pretty significant part of their workforce. The thing that I worry about the most is with all of the technological advances, is that if you lose the human interaction that we're so used to both personally and professionally then the remote work experiment will fail. \n\nI would like to see more co-working spaces kind of peppered through cities or communities that are maybe 10 miles apart and only serve about 150 members. \nWe have a growing co-working community around the lake and I expect to see that continue as we do have more people that choose Tahoe as their full time home as a result of this. We have a mountain co-working alliance, that's an alliance of about a dozen ski town co-working spaces, and one of the requirements of that is that you're located in a community with a ski resort, and I\u2019m active in the Global Workspace Association, a Women Who Co-Work group, plus one that's specific to co-working software. I am very optimistic about Co-Work Tahoe and the co-working world overall. I think remote work is the way of the future. I think people want the flexibility, and I am looking forward to more people being able to choose a lifestyle that's true to what they need personally, and it's not driven by where they have to be to work.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n***Meet Jamie at our event on 21/7.** Registration is free of charge.

(2008). Digital Ethnography: An Examination of the Use of New Technologies for Social Research. Sociology, Vol. 42, Iss. 5, pp. 837-855.\n\nThis paper discusses digital social research techniques and recommends combining both \u2018digital\u2019 and \u2018physical\u2019 ethnography. It begins by describing ethnography as telling \u2018social stories\u2019, which remains true in digital ethnography. The paper is from 2008 so while it argues that the use of new digital technologies has been slow in social research methods, this seems less true now. A lot of the technologies discussed are on the visual anthropology side of things (digital cameras, videorecording) but some include things like videoconferencng and webcam. The paper then goes on to encourage the use of four technologies: digital video, social networking websites, blogs, and online questionnaires. \n\nThe relevant parts of this paper have to do with the blogs and social networking sites. Though Murthy does point out the potential of the internet to offer anthropology at scale, the reference is to online questionnaires. People online can provide different, often more personal responses as compared to face-to-face responses (Miller and Slater). Data provided is different from that provided face-to-face, suggesting that a combo of the two methods would be powerful. Digital video, Murthy argues, also gives people who otherwise would be harder to interview a voice (like asthma patients) and also lets people control their own means of communication (instead of the ethnographer holding the recorder). Much like on our own platform, Murthy says that research blogs can be used to collaboratively share research data and results, allowing informants to interact with research as it is ongoing. Murthy calls this \u201ccollaborative ethnography\u201d, where \u201cthe community meaningfully becomes invested in the resaercher\u2019s work through consultation and critique.\u201d The online presence is democratising and holds researchers accountable. They can also chart ethnography in real time and be platforms for methods discussions. \n\nMurthy ends by saying that \u201cthe combination of participant observation with digital research methods into a \u2018multimodal ethnography\u2019 may provide a fuller, more comprehensive account\u2019 of social life. What we also have to do is make sure our analytic categories and capacities develop alongside (Sassen 2002).

It only \"seems like\" sound cryptography (using my words in the article). The problems will arise post-facto. An analyst like [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/) would argue that Apple absolutely must deliver the promises they make in their white paper. For example, they have taken the reputation of iMessage very seriously - it may be their most valuable software asset outside of OSX/iOS. Failing to do so could affect their bottom line and shareholder value.\n\nThe only other thing we have to go on is their inspiration, the open source [D3-PT](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents#apple-and-google-proposal).\n\nSo yeah, the fact it's not open source is a real shame.
