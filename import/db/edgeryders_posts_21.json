It has been developed within me, grown from the seedling of microsolidarity, in the soil of syndicalism and anarchism, over the course of many months now.\n\nTo start of, I want to specify what I believe Microsolidarity is necessary for, in extention to the points provided in the [original article](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/courage-before-hope-a-proposal-to-weave-emotional-and-economic-microsolidarity-87bc81372a09). \n\n## **Microsolidarity is a necessary step to hinder mass-manipulation in contemporary society.**\n\nI have come to strongly believe this. I will attempt to bring you with me on my thought journey. I will also try to include my emotions as I believe one (*thought*) is seldomly without the other (*emotion*) no matter how contemporary scientific paradigms may portray it. This display of emotion and thought in combo is not something I have done before, I guess practice makes.... . . .  So now, to continue my imperfection:\n\n_________________\n\n### 1. Finding the question and the freudian id\n\nWith the points of \"14 billion tons of ice melting just yesterday\", \"a need for people to come together\", \"to shape new ways of society\" and \"to connect and support each other\", all rang true to me, strong enough for Microsolidarity to embed itself within my thought patterns, I had yet to see how it connected, en masse, and why it would even come to happen at all. \n\nIn a dark corner of my mind, a bitter voice was whispering \"Why would this even take off?\". I tried not listening to the voice as best I could but silently started looking for an answer. It seemed too big of a task for humans to re-organize. I would have to see an innate contemporary human need, which microsolidarity could provide for, before I could truly believe Microsolidarity could take off. \n\nAbout two years before I read the article on Microsolidarity I watched a documentary called \"[The Swedish Theory of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyKYeaZcIM)\". Perhaps it spoke to me as a love seeking Swede, but more so it spoke to me in its reflections on the arcitechture of the isolation designed one-room, four-people-families of todays skyrises and white-picket-fence-den societies. A change which has come upon Northern Hemisphere humans in the latest 0,001% of her history. I had seen the need. Could Microsolidarity be a cure of loneliness, the satisfaction to a deep human need, a *desirable* solution?\n\n### 2. Exploring the Need\nI observed todays society to find an answer as to why society had not already collapsed by the architectured societal loneliness, for my inner logus told me it should've. I found that in a timely fashion, internet and the world wide web came to be, creating and comforting with a community for those for whom there were none.\n\nI look at the internet and see a substitution, a band-aid to the loneliness. Corporations feeding endorphines and a sense of belonging to the infected wounds of isolation.\n\nWhat started irking me was who that sense of belonging was to, really? The identites of the communities, ranging from Twitter to Reddit, from Instagram to Tumbler, were rarely through connections to any individual people but to the masse of agreed jargon and inside-jokes, meta-memes, gifs or trends. More musings on this can be [found here](%8+CGdFA7Zj+onCSva39wP2kmKIzEl9FgWvSETHWFLI0=.sha256) yet the bottom line was that these spaces were filled with payed for content, inceptions placed there with corporate incentive, propagand/commercials wearing costumes made up of memes or other relevant community coding to melt into the social settings of the artificial communities.  \n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nSo what had I found so far? \n\n- I had found that there was a need that Microsolidarity could fill: lonliness. \n- I had found that the need was already covered by artificial communities on the www. \n- I had found that these artificial communities were easy to incept with messages if one has money and that it was already happening as there was no real way of differentiating between the \"real\" users and corporate shills.\n\nThe breeding ground for mass-manipulation is close to reaching its final form, setting the tone and delivering messages with disguised messengers. \n\nWhat did I feel? \n\n- Slight desperation\n- An urgency to do something\n- A big \"Ahaaaaaa\" moment\n- An increased personal need for Microsolidarity\n\nMy conclusion is that Microsolidarity is not only a great way to go about reshaping and rebuilding the world, it is a means to avoid the dystopia which inevitably comes with mass-manipulation. \n\nIt allows for this \n\nMicrosolidarity is not only a step for a healthier earth and person, it's a necessary step of rebellion.\n\nEdit: removed an asterics", "created_at": "2019-09-16 08:30:57.866378", "updated_at": "2019-09-27 07:52:21.447537", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 793, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 193.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1856, 4022, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20250, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2403, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Good news, it seems!</b>\n\nWell done!

He was Chief Architect of Barcelona City Council until 2015, and has an architecture studio in Barcelona. He wrote resp. edited two relevant books:\n\n    * [The Self-Sufficient City: Internet has changed our lives but it hasn't changed our cities, yet.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1940291038) (2014), with [excerpts available here](https://issuu.com/actar/docs/selfsufficient).\n\n    * [Self-Sufficient City: Envisioning the Habitat of the Future](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8492861339) (2010), with [excerpts available here](https://issuu.com/actar/docs/selfsufficientcity).\n\n    * [Self-sufficient housing](http://www.guallart.com/books/self-sufficient-housing) (2006)\n\n* Regarding practical examples of self-sufficient city / apartment blocks, the only one I found was eventually not built: in 2009, there was a design competition by the city of Dallas and a design studio called \"Re:Vision Dallas\" about a self-sufficient city block, and [a design called \"Forwarding Dallas\"](https://inhabitat.com/forwarding-dallas-wins-revision-dallas-competition/) by Atelier Data and MOOV (Lisbon, Portugal) won. Construction was meant to start in 2011, but for reasons I could not find out, [the project location](https://www.fiximpactdev.com/urban-revision-central-dallas-community-development-corp/) is [still a parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/5WhqD7Wpary). Can't find the project on [the atelier's website](http://www.atelierdata.com/), either.\n\nIn total, focusing on the renovation of an existing apartment complex or city block seems a much better way in for urban radical self-sufficiency systems than to approach cities directly.

Thank you for you questions.\n1. I would love if governments and municipalities would consult with tech companies and developers in all aspects of city planning. I think some cities have seen the benefit of doing this, however most do not consider how technology can create a better user experience while streamlining the processes internally. Even something as simple as a government website can be extremely difficult for the average person to navigate, and this is usually due to the overwhelming amount of work it would take, as well as the disruption to daily processes in order to modernize outdated systems. This is something that needs to be implemented from the top down with training systems in place that allow for new technologies to be fully understood by gov/munic. employees, because when they buy in for everyone to agree on a way forward. But my answer is a resounding YES!\n\n2. Absolutely. We have even gone as far as restructuring our product to fit the current demand of our users, because things are changing right now on a day-to-day basis. People know they do not need to commute to a headquarters to be able to do it effectively, and the big hurdle we are overcoming right now is that employers are seeing that headquarters aren't necessary. Now that they have the proof that business can continue remotely, they are of course re-approaching physical office locations vs. remote work locations (including hubs). With regards to hiring many companies currently are in a hiring freeze or are in the process of down-sizing their employee base, so that remains to be seen.", "created_at": "2020-07-13 18:06:43.169028", "updated_at": "2020-07-13 18:06:43.169028", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 41.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80308], "is_liked_by": [4934, 6442], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80412, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14068, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Ping @nadia this post can move to the forum as well :)", "created_at": "2020-07-13 18:21:35.578443", "updated_at": "2020-07-13 18:21:35.578443", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60777, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 11038, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_(Originally published [here](/t/10814/13), now moved to its own public topic by @matthias.)_\n\n----\n\nIssues/Bug Fixes: @matthias\n\n1.

My journey started when I enjoyed making \u00a0stuff, using computers and being outdoors as a child. I studied BSc Environment, Economics and Ecology at York University and spent a lot of time there exploring the surrounding countryside by mountain bike, participating in races and mountain bike groups. I started a design business designing and printing <a href=\"http://www.andrewwelch.info/t-shirt-shop/\">t-shirts</a> which promoted sustainable and progressive living. I then worked as a mountain bike guide in Croatia (Korcula). Returning to the UK I worked for a network company as an engineer, web developer and graphic designer. I then prepared to cycle round the world. Between 2007 and 2010 <a href=\"http://weaveoftheride.com/blog\">I cycled from England to Georgia</a>, <a href=\"http://betweenworlds.bike\">then to India, lived in Georgia and travelled to and cycled in Mongolia</a>. I returned to the UK and studied MA Design Critical Practice at Goldsmiths. I wrote two books about my cycle travels (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Weave-The-Ride-Andy-Welch/dp/1477531394\">Weave of the Ride </a>| <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Between-Worlds-The-Promise-Road/dp/1494710854\">Between Worlds</a>). I invented <a href=\"http://www.wandermap.org\">Wandermap</a> which is a theory and project around psychogeography (including a guidebook called '<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Open-Wilderness-Guiding-Book/dp/1492366072\">The Open Wilderness Guiding Book</a>). My dissertation was a skill sharing app called Wequest. I have a <a href=\"http://www.designmethodsandprocesses.co.uk\">website of 'methods'</a> (design, research, etc) that I would like to open up to the Edgeryders community. I worked for a design startup called <a href=\"http://www.stromatolite.com/\">Stromatolite</a> which created the Music Tech Fest Brand and Open Product Licenses.

I'd love to share with you (and anyone!) more reflections on dealing creatively and positively with conflict in any community. The nice thing about online communities is that we can, potentially, put in place some features that may potentially reinforce, through careful design, the kinds of interactions that we see as helpful.\n\nI've been thinking recently, particularly, about some kind of \"safe space\" built in to online fora, staffed by people who are specially good at non-judgemental listening. Relatedly, in the offline world, I have a lot of time for Parker Palmer and his \"Circles of Trust\", and the late Marshall Rosenberg's NVC.\n\nI guess I am trying to say \"giving abundant slack is a skill that we can learn\".

To make them the best they could be we need a few more information and a post about your event to use to reach out to interesting participants and discussion members.\n\nHere a list of the next steps:\n\n1. Please give your event a title and share that with us by filling it in [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/festival-program-overview/10731/8) in the programme overview or simply answering to that thread.\n2. If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, please write a post about your event with information such as [this example](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326) about the AI event in Brussels. We would like to have those posts up by Monday the 7th of October, latest by the 10th. We know all of you are amazing and busy people, but we need to be able to communicate the events as soon as possible to make the best impact for all of us! Once you have written you post we can push your post and include it in the minisite for the festival https://festival.edgeryders.eu/ which you can also use to share with those interested to orient themselves better about the festival and to sign up to join :)\n3. Each of the NGI related event posts needs to have a &ldquo;Frequently asked Questions&rdquo; footer added to them. You can find the template [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/frequently-ask-question-section-to-add-to-festival-event-posts/10982). Just copy it in edit mode, past it under your post and make sure to adjust the second paragraph which names the organisers with your and your collaborator's names.\n4. Please post a short one-paragraph bio of yourself [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/festival-participant-bios/10905) if you are not already in that post\n5. The[ next Community Call](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-festival-going-places/10984) on Tuessday the 8th of October 18:00 Brussels time is for you to discuss how to collaborate with events locally and how to organise and finance travels for those that are not yet there :) (https://zoom.us/j/489971765)\n6. It would be great to also have more 1-1 calls to discuss your events in detail! Please send me some dates and times that would work for you personally :)\n\n7.

Since not all of it can be used for plants, you'd need a way to separate wastewater into different kinds at source. And a way to filter out particles, soap etc. (which can be a simple slow sand filter). And make people use biodegradable soap for handwashing etc..\n\n* Wastewater that cannot go directly on the plants can still benefit the plants by making their microclimate cooler and more humid.

In my experience, institutions take bids from web development companies and make their choice based on their own set of priorities and budget plus, frankly, how good a bidding company is at convincing the institution to go with their plan.  Often people who make large budget decisions are not heavy users of their own sites and have no real training or experience in UX design.  Thus they can be sold more on sizzle than steak so to speak.  If it looks good then it must work well...we here know that is not true.  But many decision makers seemingly do not.\n\nAnd yes, no doubt connecting a new site up to an old database is often a frustrating journey that ends in partial or even total failure.  But so many times I have tried to navigate a large institutional site not having a good sense of the overall design scheme.  And some of it is just a matter of what buttons get put where and what is on a drop down menu. Or how you pay for something, or how effectively or comprehensively the search works.\n\nSo I agree with you that it beneficial for governments and municipalities to consult with tech companies.  I think the earlier the better in a planning process, and outside of a specific contract bidding process.

Many hard questions were asked, one of wish was: **\u201cWhere can and should critical questions regarding data collation and interpretation be directed?\u201d** The answer, of course, is complicated and multilayered, but one place is in the thread bellow which we used to announce and prepare the session and which is still open for concrete as well as meta-methodological questions on the topic:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world-applying-collective-intelligence-to-big-data-3rd-of-june/13537\n\nDisinformation is dangerous, and once it spreads very hard to contain. It is even hard to name. **How can we give specific, true and effective names to the different aspects of the troublesome phenomenon of disinformation and improve upon proposed categories?**\n\nAnd for the next step:\n\n**Are there communities where mis/dis/malinformation is less prevalent and can we use those as models to build a better internet?**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/disinformation-strategies-and-tactics/13702\n\nAt the moment many big tech companies present themselves as saviours in the crisis and are welcomed with open arms and presented as \u201cBenevolent Dictators\u201d. But **\u201cWhat if we would organize the infrastructure development of the Internet in a similar manner to free and open-source software?\u201d** and How?\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766\n\n*This leads also back to the question of how to deal with the effective rise of power on the side of such big tech companies in the wake of COVID:*\n\n[https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-second-coming-of-big-tech-in-the-age-of-covid-19/13564]\n\n### Looking at the whole platform I would also like to bring a few more posts to your attention:\n\nFirst, the newest and most dazzling way to take a step back and see all of Edgeryders unfold is presented here in a**n animated visualisation of the whole network** by @aberto:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-visualized-a-tentative-animation/13751\n\nAnother summary and interpretation of the ongoing conversations can be found here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/is-coronavirus-the-tipping-point-for-our-already-imbalanced-system/13741\n\n### And finally: Two Summits:\n\n1. **Edgeryders \u201cMaking a Living\u201d Summit**\n\n* As you may already know Edgeryders is planning a Summit on the topic of \u201cMaking a Living\u201d asking \u201cHow can we make a livelihood during a time of crisis and while doing good work instead of bullshit jobs?\u201d\n* Edgeryders \u201cMaking a Living\u201d Summit will take place in September and October, however some presummit listening session already take place in June and July. the first one this week: [After covid19: while food businesses are failing, can community oriented food projects be the way forward?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/after-covid19-while-food-businesses-are-failing-can-community-oriented-food-projects-be-the-way-forward/13409/2)\n\n* The next one brings together knowledge workers and policymakers in higher education, also allying with unions and rights defenders, with their histories of mobility, migration and refuge:\n[Session on endangered researchers and precarity in higher education](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414)\n\n**You can follow the developing Summit programme here:**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/summit-program/13402\n\n2. **NGI Policy Summit**\n\nIn September there will also be a summit on NGI policies organised by our partners at NESTA. We have set up a new category in NGI for the development of that summit which opened today.

It requires, most fundamentally, participant-observation. This is why I've theorised before that the Edgeryders team actually does ethnography in a collective, distributed fashion: through community management  + qualitative coding + qualitative data analysis. And as I think about this more, it means a kind of poetic extension of the notion of collective intelligence that is so central to Edgeryders work. From my perspective, we are not only mapping collective intelligence through ethnographic practice: we are using it to undertake that ethnographic practice as well. \n\nIn a sense this means that it may not be the worst idea to have people doing both community management and coding at the same time, as doing both could lead to a more robust total 'ethnographer' role. At the same time, and as I'm sure @noemi and @johncoate would attest, the role of a community manager is actually above and beyond that of an ethnographer in terms of participation --- they aren't just tasked with understanding the community, but also with creating the conditions possible for the community to function in a healthy way. This is ultimately why I think the roles should remain separate, while also closely connected (just as in Open Care). \n\nInstead (and above and beyond) I think it will be important for our ethnographic coding team to be deeply immersed -- interacting with posts and even, if they feel so inclined, contributing their own content to the platform. I got a lot out of the post I made in Open Care: it made me understand the vulnerability one has to feel to post one's experiences, often intimate, and what it felt like to interact back and forth with other community members. This kind of insight is invaluable to an ethnographer trying to understand lived experience. I'd like to participate more this time around, through commenting and engaging in conversation with community members.\n\nBy definition, the kind of qualitative coding we do on the platform requires in-depth engagement with community members' stories: we aren't just coding our own field notes, we are directly coding the interactive contributions of community members, aggregating and theorising as we go to try to map the collective intelligence of the community. This, to me, is the most engaged kind of coding I've ever done, because a) it isn't just coding one person's contributions, whether in interview form or in the form of my own field notes and b) people can actually see and interact with my codes! It was very cool to be talking with @alex_levene and @johncoate (among many other generous community members who gave us their time)   at Open Village not only around the ethnographic findings, but around the actual process of coding itself. Alex got to see the codes associated to his post and give feedback, see how it was visualised (with the help of @jason_vallet and @alberto) , and give coding a go himself, all of which helped me get an even more detailed and nuanced understanding. \n\nIn short -- collective ethnography for collective intelligence has a methodological resonance to me, and I'm looking forward to exploring and furthering it even more.", "created_at": "2018-09-06 05:17:07.289819", "updated_at": "2018-09-06 05:26:49.512364", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 584, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 643.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4, 2915, 4654], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33415, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 1131, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>re: Excellent point</b>\n\nand it would be sad if this was framed as you\u00a0are for/against Facebook.

Home nurses, to be specific.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recession in the NL, it became both public policy and also wildly supported by companies to take folks on as freelancers.  In my town of 50,000 people was located a company which employed home nurses and sent them out all over the region. In one go they changed them all to freelancers, women (mostly women) who had never been nor had they ever wanted to be entrepreneurs.\n\nI call these the accidental entrepreneurs.  People who either are switched from employment to freelance or find themselves with no alternative but to freelance. This happens to women a lot and has for generations: My grandmother was an accidental entrepreneur, my mother was one, and I was one.\n\nSo as a coworking space we mobilized a six week crash course in basic entrepreneurship:  we got a guy from the Tax authority to come tell them how to do their taxes and keep records, we got a lawyer to come tell them that their rights were and to look at their contracts, we brought in several coworkers who were intentional entrepreneurs to come talk to them about the good side of freelancing. We had a guy come talk to them about pensions and about disability insurance.

Doing in this way, the rampette and pulsante are still important but they become one of the service touch points.\n\nIn my view this shift form a product- to a service-based approach has several advantages. I will quote two, quite different ones:\n\n<em>For the sake of this specific OpenRampette project</em>: it permits to better discuss the related relational issues: which are the interactions between disabled persons and shopkeepers? Could the barrier be not only physical but also psychological and cultural? For instance: how does the disabled person know if he/she is really welcomed? (on this point I will come back later).\n\n<em>For the sake of OpenCare research</em>: it permits to use for this specific project a language (interactions, encounters and conversations) that, I think, could help in connecting this OpenRampette project with the overall OpenCare Research. For instance, it permits to focus on care, intended as a human relationship: a care relationship that goes beyond the rampette and the pulsante per se, but nevertheless can give them form and meaning.\n\n<strong>(2) </strong>In my view, the problem the \u201crampette-pulsante system\u201d (or using the proposed service-oriented approach, the \u201cdisabled person-shopkeeper encounter\u201d) should be better characterized: \u00a0\n\nIs it a shop that is visited everyday or frequently (therefore the shopkeeper is well known by the disabled person and vice versa), or not?\n\nIs it a shop where the disabled person plans to go (because he/she needs to buy some precise items) or is it a shop he/she likes to enter just to have a look (because he/she likes shopping and window-shopping)?\n\nDoes the disabled person move around alone, or does a helper accompany him/her?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI think the systems should be designed keeping in account these different possibilities \u2026\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-28 05:26:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.824714", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 375, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3520], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86248, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14712, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@alberto this is POPREBEL not NGI, right?

[See this paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvUw1Ux8Mc-GQmbXAisE2P1cw3l4uZfxBDOn-zYnquc/edit).  \n\nI was contacted by Tibirius to look into what partners could be possibly interested to work on this from Brussels. From a maker perspective I contacted CIN which whom I was already working on a possible[ FabCity Brussels](https://blog.fab.city/the-future-of-fablabs-lays-in-collaboration-from-fabcity-brussels-to-verdun-montreal-for-the-7ed98268febd) earlier this year and where FabLab Mobile emerged thanks to the[ IJV methodology](https://openwall.citizenlab.co/posts/LutoqD2CtKqESkh5r/ijv14-mobile-fablab-collective-proposal). CIN has a lot of interesting pieces of the puzzle to create the NRP. \n\nBut I also thought about Edgeryders because of the decentralized methodology, the global vision and the diversity of topics it wants to tackle through collective work. Standardizing collaborative work through values, affects and resources could solidify a new form of work that is much more organic and fluid (and possibly healthy for everybody). Creating highly trustable collaboration with people from other countries without needing a lack of trust being an issue.\n\n\nSome example without using the block/holo chain technology, just on a human level\n\nResources: You receive as an organization or a collective a contract but you can\u2019t deliver on the contract, find through NRP easily other organizations that have the time and the same capacities to tackle the problem. Share through Fairshare for exemple the parts of the incomes according to the degree implication \n\nValues: knowing that other organization work on the same value level by having a look on how they work in shown thematics. Like having the notion Open Source given to a project that is really open source through a external rating system. \n\n\nAffects (thanks @anique.yael to introduce me to this)  that we can more easily find that some people are fighting personal struggles and that we can relieve them, not point out their failure, but support them in any way possible. Affect theory could help to categories more easily when people are in trouble. Again, not to put them outside of the system, but to rebalance the workload between the organic collective. \n\nThis is a first introduction, \nYou can find on the P2P website a more technical background of the work in progress\nhttp://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Network_Resource_Planning", "created_at": "2017-12-20 15:49:47.001579", "updated_at": "2017-12-20 15:49:47.001579", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 128.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4631], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78895, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13861, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@owen, any news on this?

He was talking about an economy which was 8x his by 2030. We already have a society 8x his, but we are working -- not 3 hr/day, but still much less than they did in his time. In 1930 people worked an average of 69 hours a week; now the average work week in the US (including vacations) is about 33 hours.\n\nThing is that we need more. And by that I don't mean only \"stuff\" -- possessions. Yes, our houses are twice as big -- well, if you lived in the average British hovel in 1930 you'd have wanted more space too. We have hugely better medicine -- yes we spend too much for it in the US, but on the plus side life expectancy at birth has risen from 61 to 79. We have refrigeration -- that deserves a place all to itself -- food storage, air conditioning -- considered to be the most important invention of the industrial age -- maybe excepting the steam engine. We spend the great majority of our incomes on services -- housing, transportation (cars mostly), education, medical, legal & financial -- and far less on food and clothing than in 1930. Keynes did not take into account just how much income would be needed to make the lives of average Britons good -- as it turns out, it needed to increase more than 8x to push hours down to 3/day.\n\nIMO, though, what is needed is not more income as such, but primarily different organizational arrangements -- I think we need more communities, so that people's sense of belonging can be enhanced, and mutual support structures can be strengthened. And I doubt that government can do that. It might be that social media can help with it, but evidence I have seen suggests that rather than creating a sense of community, people who spend more time on social media actually feel LESS integrated into a community. Equality of opportunity is important. Technology can be helpful, but I think the future is people rubbing up against each other and figuring out how to get along.

I've recently received 100k EUR grant from the Swedish Arts Grants Committee fund Kulturbryggan to develop open source web based  software for participatory culture organisations and collaboration between artists working on big projects. Only Swedish residents or organisations are eligible for this fund, so I applied with my own company with Edgeryders as a collaborating partner, and received the grant in full to my own company. However, I will funnel most of these funds into Edgeryders which will be the party responsible for research and development. We're calling the initiative Particip.io, and the plan is to both continue development on a number of ongoing projects and to develop prototypes of new exciting ideas. Development will happen in a community that will hopefully live past this initial funding  and continue development and deployment of the projects we'll develop in a self-sustained fashion. Of course, that community will work and collaborate here on the Edgeryders platform.\n\nSome ongoing projects will be included in Particip.io and the goal is to develop these to a state where they can be readily deployed with ease. [Dreams, a platform to plan and distribute funds to projects at co-created events](http://dreams.theborderland.se/), will be developed to a state where it will be possible to use it for events without having access to a developer for setup and maintenance, and hosted as a service. It's currently at a reasonably mature stage of development and has been used in production at multiple events over the last few years. Much of the development has been done by Gal Bracha, who is a founding partner of the Particip.io project who will also work on Dreams and coordinate development with the existing community tied to that platform. [Realities, a platform to manage and visualise needs and responsibilities in a decentralised organisation](https://github.com/theborderland/realities), will be developed to state where it can be deployed in production for the Borderland, a participatory event and collaborative community in Scandinavia. Two developers who have worked on Realities before will join the Particip.io project \u2013 Erik Frisk and Matt Parsons.\n\nDevelopment of some components of SenseStack (GraphRyder, OpenEthnographer, EdgeSense) might also be included, but since those tools are vital to the newly funded POPREBEL project, it might make more sense to develop the SenseStack suite within that context.\n\nIn addition to working on existing projects, the Particip.io community will dream up, prototype and perhaps develop and deploy other platforms and tools for participatory art and culture. Our primary goal with these explorations is to push the boundaries of how we collaborate and dream together, and a secondary goal is to bring ideas to life that could spinn off into projects that could secure additional funding for the Particip.io community. @nadia will be involved in this part of the project, focusing on exploring what directions it could take.\n\n## How to get involved\n\nWork on Particip.io will be done in four different forms:\n\n1. Open freelance development\n2. Exploratory hackathons\n3. Focused development weeks\n4. Freelance development\n\n### Open freelance development\nYou are more than welcome to contribute to the codebase and start working on an issue whenever you want to. You'll be joining the Particip.io community, and developers who make consistent contributions may be invited to join for a hackathon or  a focused development week or allotted paid hours to do more focused long term work.\n\n### Exploratory hackathons\nA total of three hackathons will be held in 2019. These will be 4 days long, with 8-12 participants. Travel, food and accommodation will be paid for by the project. Each of these hackathons will focus on exploring and prototyping solutions to specific problems collected from participants on the ER platform. Participants in the hackathons are developers, designers, artists and visionaries. Hackathon participants must not be professionals, and it's preferable to have a mix of people from different background. One hackathon will be hosted by Matt Parsons outside of Malm\u00f6, another will be held at Tivedstorp outside of Lax\u00e5 and the location of the third hackathon is yet to be decided.\n\n### Focused development weeks\nMuch of the hands on development of the projects will happen during focused work weeks, where 2-4 developers and designers meet somewhere to design and code functional prototypes or new releases of some Particip.io project. Travel and accommodation is provided by the project, and each participant is also payed 1000 EUR for the week. In 2019, we will host at least 5 of these development weeks in locations decided on by the participants. Participants in these development weeks should be skilled developers or designers.\n\n### Paid freelance development\nWe have a total of 240 hours of freelance developer hours available at a rate of 40 EUR per hour. These hours will only be used by developers have participated in active development, have already contributed quality controlled additions to the code base of a project and want to spend freelance time on developing features or fixing bugs and issues.\n\n## Get involved\nGo to the [Particip.io category](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/participio) to get involved.", "created_at": "2018-08-07 02:22:46.537830", "updated_at": "2018-09-05 15:46:59.883526", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 898, "wiki": false, "reads": 46, "score": 3784.2, "like_count": 13, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4539, 4, 5, 3, 1935, 3791, 3362, 4623, 4566, 4624, 4631, 3904, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25649, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 1777, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>They would be thrilled :-)</b>\n\nCan't wait to have ERs pop up on the community mt2019 website!!!\n\nWelcome, welcome, welcome...\n\nSimply go to\u00a0<a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/\">http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/</a>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>top-right of the home page: ACCEDI | RESISTRATI (click on \"registrati\")</li>\n\n<li>ssername, email address, password, confirm password + question to test if you are a human visitor (I'll write to the webmaster right now and tell him to put the questions in English!)</li>\n\n<li>you will recieve an email to validate the registration</li>\n\n<li>log on and create your profile (picture and brief description)\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>once Noemi will post the mission (this Monday), you will be able to comment on it!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nYou will find some fellow ERs in the community already!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-20 08:40:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.643489", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 149, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25647], "is_liked_by": [3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38400, "user_id": 3595, "topic_id": 7448, "post_number": 1, "raw": "My name is Mar\u00eda Boto and I\u2019m from Spain.

As part of this buildup, it has asked Edgeryders to [help them set up a community](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-and-matera-2019-to-build-a-community-of-creative-and-cultural-projects/7205/1) where creative and cultural projects can be developed in a collaborative way between people in town and anywhere. These projects are mostly meant for the city's own 2019 cultural program, but they can also be taken elsewhere if their creators so wish. The community will kick off on Saturday 2nd and Sunday 3rd of December 2017, with a two-days course on building and maintaining community, held by @noemi and @johncoate.  \n\nAnybody is welcome, from anywhere, and the course is free of charge (though registration is required, and the number of participants is capped at 25). But Matera sees itself as a natural bridge between the north and the south shores of the Mediterranean, and wishes to develop stronger relationships with people on all shores. So, **it is offering to fund the travel and accommodation to the course for up to four people from the southern or eastern Mediterranean**. If you see yourself doing that, and if you would like to connect your community with Matera 2019, consider applying. Fondazione Matera 2019 will also write a letter of invitation that you can show to the Italian consulate in your country. \n\nDeadline: October 31st.

I have had periods where I have studied full time during the day and worked late night shifts.

They are not advertised, but if you are specialised and vocal enough about your personal obsessions/passions, then it\u00b4s more likely the right people and opportunities will find you. But it takes time, years.\u00a0 Is very hard for a while, and exhausting. Especially if you are not excited about having to do self-promotion. And stressful.

And deep NLP is unworkable, because it requires datasets of several orders of magnitude larger than the ones we can reasonably produce. In Masters of Network 6 we tried out a very simple machine learning algorithm for topic extraction on the opencare corpus. To even get the model to run, we had to use a technique called bootstrap. This meant resampling the same corpus 100 times. \n\nLesson learned: for doing machine learning on text analysis by brute force, you need _a lot_ of text. At that point in time the opencare corpus had about 2,500 posts, with about 600K words. It took a year and a lot of money to get it together. And for ML to work, we would have needed at least 250K posts with 60 million words! The whole of Edgeryders at this time (after 6+ years) is a bit less than 40K posts, maybe 9 million words?

Now she is continuing our collaboration by doing translations online, in her spare time. \u00a0It would be great if we could find other ways for people to visit and then continue to collaborate.\n\nMy initial thoughts on what would be useful collaborations with edgeryders who want to visit are:\n\n<strong>Italian</strong> for translations and communications (answering the phone, replying to text messages and emails, writing announcements\u2026)\n\nSkills in facilitation, planning and decision making, and developing sustainable organizational structures.\n\nAdvising on an \u201conboarding process\u201d for new UnMonks plan.\n\nWorkshops or skill shares related to our individual projects or the overall project of UnMon.\n\nWe have a visitor form on the website- so people could start with this.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-26 12:04:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:29.812685", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 213, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80280, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 14062, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:4, topic:14062\"]\nLet us know if and how much you want to charge for client communication / requirement analysis or similar.

Update on latest developments</b>\n\nHi, and sorry for this delay in the reporting back to you.\n\nAs I wrote back in June, I had several meetings with the Egyptian government in Cairo and made the Minister of International cooperation, Dr Amr Darrag, sign an agreement on several projects concerning anti-corruption and public procurement process as well as taxation system. Dr Darrag was also very interested in letting Edgeryders create UnMonastery in Cairo. The ink didn't have the time to dry before General Sisi and his military overthrew the islamist government of Egypt in a coup, that was accompanied by massive popular protests. Saudi and the UAE were the first to welcome the new transitional government, but neither US nor the EU have made strong statements against the coup. Dr Darrag is now no longer in the government, and he refuses to cooperate with the interim rulers of Egypt, even though he has got the question.\n\nSo where does this bring Un Monastery Cairo? Well, Dr Darrag is meeting with the Swedish Ambassador, Mrs K\u00e4rre, tomorrow afternoon to discuss some of these issues. He will ask the Ambassador to inform the new government about the planned cooperation between Sweden and Egypt, concerning anti-corruption and open procurement. In this meeting, he will also talk about the UnMonastery as a project on national dialogue and ask the Swedish Ambassador to push for a continuation of this project, also with the new government. Hopefully the new government will be open to cooperation with Sweden and with Edgeryders in these projects. I will let you know about the outcome of this meeting.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-19 10:28:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.461561", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 281, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30608, "user_id": 3468, "topic_id": 647, "post_number": 24, "raw": "HI\u00a0@noemi, sorry it took me so long to answer you, I've been traveling.

I've had the chance to study and live in the states and in Canada and my experiences in those cultural environments helped me understand other ways to address artistical activities, in a more positive and balanced way.\u00a0While in Boston I had the great luck to find a sumi-e master that introduced me to the practice of Japanese brush painting, yet another approach to art that includes irrational thought without the angst. I have never developed a theory on all this, but my observations on how the individual artist relates to the society in the different cultures, what is expected of the creative role\u00a0and how we teach art\u00a0leads me to think that we in Europe need to overcome this tragical\u00a0tradition.

I played in a reasonably successful band called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FModena_City_Ramblers&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwvnnPtB3IJVRt8UoLF0vOcOD-TQ\">Modena City Ramblers</a> (yup). We were not villa-and-swimmingpool rich, but were doing reasonably well. For a number of reasons, I decided to quit the band, and start over at the age of 34.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.stereodinamica.it/gallerie/ff200908/01b.jpg\" style=\"float: left; height: 299px; width: 200px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\">My main asset was that, before I quit my job to become a full-time musician at the age of 28, I had been working as a private sector researcher in the field of economics. I had degrees, a few publications, and some idea of how to make sense of issues involving people and money. I also had a quite deep, firsthand knowledge of the music business. In the early 2000s there was a lot of talking about creative industries; I was an economist, and I knew at least one of them from the inside. It was a start. So I decided to try to become an economist of music and the creative industries.\n\nIt was hard to come by any paid work in this area, despite the glamour of my recent musical past that made me quite well-known in some circles. I worked with the City of Modena on a string of music-related projects (mostly designing vocational training courses for would-be music entrepreneurs, with some research thrown in), but I would make 8 to 15.000 euro per gig; it was sustainable... just about. We were doing interesting stuff and would even get some media interest, but I was the lowliest of the low in the ecosystem of economic research. Of course, no stability was anywhere in sight.\n\nI tried to structure this activity a bit more: I started a company, and participated in a bid for running an experimental project funded by the European Social Fund. We won, but it was a disaster nevertheless: it turned out the way these projects are often handled in Italy is very bureaucratic, procedure-oriented instead of result-oriented. The amount of red tape was horrible and very expensive, and everybody operated under the assumption that everybody was just out to get a share of public funding, with no commitment to achieving anything of substance. My company (less so the other partners in the consortium) ended up doing a good job, but we also ended up losing money rather than making it. I left this space immediately after, and I'm not planning to be back.\n\n<strong>Fortunately, I had overinvested in these smalltime projects</strong>. They paid my bills, and as long as my bills were payed I worked very hard, going for outputs that were worth several times more than I was getting paid for. It did not make any economic sense at the time, but it did give me a good conceptual arsenal. Also fortunately, the music industry got caught in the digital storm early in the game: Napster reached its peak in 2001. My band had been running websites and experimenting with new media since 1998. So I already had some sense of how to use simple Internet tools (first mailing lists, then blogs, then social networks) to fuel social dynamics.\n\nSo, starting in 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development starting hiring me for consultancy gigs in the creative industries field, that were better paid and more interesting. I deployed Internet tools with everything I did: they cost next to nothing and were very effective, also because they propitiate transparency and trust between public administrations that use them (if they use them well) and citizens. I discovered they are great in enabling collaboration between individual citizens and administrations; this had previously been practically impossible, but now suddenly it was possible, and it had the potential to make public policy more similar to Wikipedia. In one of these gigs I designed and directed <a href=\"http://progettokublai.ning.com\">Kublai</a>, an online network for peer-to-peer editing of business plans in the creative sector. It worked well. There was something there.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/COPERTINA-cottica-front-def-186x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 186px; height: 300px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\">At this point I decided to push my profile from a \u201cvertical\u201d space (creative industries) into an \u201chorizontal\u201d one (online tools for policy). The advantage is obvious: you can and should do online policy in any field, not just in the creativity/culture one. I wanted to be where the momentous decisions are really made, where the best minds are put to work, and that is not cultural policy. As much as I think culture is important, I had to accept that the vast majority of senior decision makers think it is really not a priority. So I wrote some articles and a book called <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia\">Wikicrazia</a>, intended to be a handbook for understanding and making policy through online tools. Once again, overinvestment: 18 months of (not full-time!) work for a book that I expect to sell 1000 copies. It does not make economic sense. But it does, because my few readers tend to be decision makers: one out of five is a potential client. Also, I used the book to push my profile internationally: I got people working for the White House, the World Bank, Cisco and other international institutions to collaborate and endorse me. The book was picked up by the media, and that gave me the standing of \u201cthat Italian guy\u201d that knows about the stuff. Meanwhile I am doing more overinvestment: I started a Ph.D. in network theory, to figure out in a hard science sense why online networks work so well.\n\nI am reasonably satisfied with my transition: I managed not to go bankrupt, even supporting others at time, and reconfigure my life. It does have two problems:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>it is not over: stability is not achieved, and I am not sure it ever will</li>\n\n<li>it required me to compress my standard of living for several years. Live in small, low-quality accommodation, saving on things like holidays and consumption goods.</li>\n\n</ol>And this leads to the second pillar of my strategy, which is <strong>self-motivation</strong>. I was able to do this stuff because I absolutely love it and I think it is important. Otherwise I would never have been able to work so hard for so little money at 40 years of age. My main problem now is how to consolidate and stabilize, as I prepare for my old age. You have suggestions? I'm listening.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-14 15:55:20", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 04:27:45.095305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1177, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2223, 2331, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13356, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1225, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<em>The most entrepreneurial and strategic people, who also were reasonably competent musicians had the most success.</em>\n\nAnd the moral is: <strong>be entrepreneurial and strategic in whatever you do, don't rely solely on talent?</strong>\n\nWhen <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/shine-some-light/mission_case/edgemapper-chosen-alberto\">nominating</a> you as an Edgemapper, I thought about your life choices in the following way:\n\n<em>The greatest risk may be: ok, you change what you do for something else you think you love at one point, but be careful: if it's a totally new thing, you have to catch up in order to really be good at what you do.

Sometimes it feels like if X fails, then everything\u00a0<em>comes to a crashing halt</em>, and that's a terrifying concept. However, it also isn't true: the world keeps turning. What's the worst possible thing that could happen to you? Even if that happens, the world keeps turning, and as long as that worst possible thing isn't \"you died,\" you're going to wake up the next day and find out that the fear of \"everything stops\" is mistaken. There is always <a href=\"http://www.thesmartpolitenerd.com/anylanding.html\">some next step</a>.\n\nIncorporating this into your decision-making, both the rational and emotional parts of it, is one of the keys to making peace with the threat of failure.

In that trade, it is completely evident that *the maker is the product*: people buy not only into the music you make, but into your cultural project, even your persona as an artist. The worker is the work. \n\nSo, my activity would consist of apparently random stuff. Daydream at the piano; read Latin American crime novels; listen to other people's music; do my tax returns; shop for surplus Eastern Germany military clothing, for a long time my signature look onstage an off; build the band's website (late 1990s). Occasionally an idea for a new song would come out. Occasionally that became a full-fledged song, which occasionally would later be recorded, released and performed live. \n\nGood luck finding a notion of \"productivity\" in this.\n\nInstead, what made sense to me is this: my life is a kind of project. The project changes over time, but there is always a project. I use the project to interact with the world, meet people, fall in love, make friends and sometimes enemies. Everything I do is part of this; some activities are monetized, others are not. I don't care, as long as the project is going well and I am not starving (which would make the project go very badly indeed). \n\nProductivity is not a major concern for me, and I only track my time if I have to or if I suspect I am doing things wrong. My concern, instead, is integration and coherence: I resent activities that are not advancing me on my project. This is where my aversion to bureaucracy and management techniques comes from. \n\nOf course, remote work is a great match for this. Like Matt says, when you are pursuing a fairly broad life project, you need a lot of freedom in mapping it onto a whole range of idiosyncratic activities, some of which will result in false starts, etc.  \nMost of these buildup activities are best done alone, on your own time. If you try to do them in group, you are going to spend most of your time waiting for others. This was very clear in music. For a band of 6-7 people to rehearse together a 4 minutes song, you would normally need 10 or  more minutes, between coordinating to start, giving each other feedback, toilet breaks etc. This work is still necessary, but it will flow best if people have already learned how to play their parts at home. \n\nConclusion: I like to work remotely, with high-energy, highly coordinated in-person sprints every now and then. And the money comes from whatever direction. It's worked well enough so far, and this amount of freedom would be *very* hard to give up.", "created_at": "2020-09-25 09:25:25.782485", "updated_at": "2020-09-25 09:25:25.782485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 557, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 88.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [83716], "is_reply_to": [83716], "is_liked_by": [3, 5, 3206, 2915, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88566, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 15075, "post_number": 8, "raw": "@Vismay, this seems to be a commodities exchange. \n\n* **magic convertor**. Given the usual (but that need close scrutiny!) assumptions of unhindered competition and reasonably available information, this is simply the the job of any commodity market. Market operators know what makes commodities useful, and have ideas as to how such usefulness will evolve in the future. driving demand. Market interaction aggregate all their ideas into an equilibrium price, that, in neoclassical economics, is equivalent to the marginal value of that commodity into the economy. \n* **stocks**. Stock exchanges exchange stocks. Human labor is not stockpilable as a raw material (it is when you incorporate it into an artifact: a craftsman puts a month of her time in building a grand piano). Nor is it transportable. Moving labor around *en masse* is what Polanyi called \"dislocation\", and had Very Bad Effects in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.  By the way, @jolwalton knows much about this stuff: check out [this post](/t/8582/54?u=alberto).

[...] Brand would stop being a differential for price.\n[/quote]\n\n* **brand**. That's one of the cruces of the matter. In order to make intellectual sense, neoclassical economics assumes that preferences are exogenous. Demand for steel or iPhones is \"out there\", and companies serve it. Once you introduce the ability for companies to create desires, they operate both on the demand and on the supply side of the market. Equilibria vanish, as both sides of the market push to sell more and more. Equilibrium price lose meaning. \n\n[quote=\"VismayHarani, post:1, topic:15075\"]\nIn absence of competition or driving force of greed to earn more, it would, in the end, kill innovation. New technologies would stop being developed. Such a society would perfect the art of making round wheels in the cheapest and fastest way possible, but they would never take off to the air.\n[/quote]\n\nAre you sure? It seems to me that humans have started innovating millennia before capitalism showed up, and never stopped developing new technologies. And it's not just me. Mariana Mazzucato has written [a definitive reality check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrepreneurial_State) on \"private innovation\". It contains the famous slide of the iPhone, showing how everything that makes the iPhone smart was invented in public labs, by taxpayer-funded researchers. The Internet; the GPS; the touch screen; the world wide web, and so on.  And Eric von Hippel [has shown](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/26044) that the majority of product innovation is done by ordinary people, mostly non-professionals.

One such tool is already being built, and its purpose is to be a sort of mix between an organisational chart, a task manager and a stakeholder mapping tool for those wanting to make a decision in a decentralised organisation or participatory event. It is called [Realities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/realities-project-white-paper/9064), and it will be used to scale participation in governance and infrastructure work for the participatory event The Borderland in 2019. It's [live on a staging server in unfinished form here](https://realities-staging.herokuapp.com). Eventually [it will share data with other systems](https://edgeryders.eu/t/grand-visions-how-do-we-tie-things-together/9071/12?u=hugi) used by the Borderland, including a web app called [Dreams](http://dreams.theborderland.se/) which we will also develop further in the Particip.io project.\n\nWe have a few other projects um the pipes this year. One is a guide to mobile AR development by @jakobskote, detailing how he developed a [digital mobile exhibition on hybrid animals for the Swedish Museum of National History](http://www.nrm.se/en/besokmuseet/utstallningar/nyadjuriar.9005778.html). \n\nMore will be added.

I am a double citizen, but in this post I will consider \"my country\" to mean Italy, the country where I was born. \n\nItaly has created an [AI Task Force](https://ia.italia.it) as part of the [Agenzia per l'Italia Digitale](http://www.agid.gov.it/). It consists of academics, practitioners and a few free thinkers, rather than civil servants (I know and respect several of them), and seems to be tasked mostly with providing a vision and principles. In March 2018, the Task Force released a white paper which makes all the right noises (human-centric! bias-free! inequalities reducing!), but it's hard to know how credible these noises are. In the past, the Italian state has not always been a good purchaser of ICT services. Vendors have had a lot of torque in pushing through proprietary solutions; and even when the government-side buyers had a clear idea of what they wanted, they have tended to be motivated by cost and staff reduction. For example, as in other countries, staffed counters to serve citizens trying to access public services are disappearing everywhere, replaced by websites and phone apps. This makes sense (especially if you do not to question the administrative ordering underneath, but this is another story that [James Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State) and [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) have already told very well), but it raises major inequalities problems. Senior civil servants know this, but they are under pressure to reduce their workforce and save costs.\n\nThe Task Force is also trying to inventory government projects that use AI, as well as simple needs that could be met by deploying AI tools.

This ambiguity is a result of my note-taking style, so apologies for that.\n\nBy way of example of what I mean - In the summer of 2007, I spent a couple of months learning MFC for Windows programming. Having gained much experience since then, I have come to consider that time not to have been particularly well spent. If I had a time machine and could place myself (knowing what I know now) in a mentorship role for my younger self, then I probably would advise my younger self to investigate WPF rather than MFC. This would have helped my younger self to achieve my goal at that time (\"I want to develop this Windows application\") but also have set me up with a skill that would be more useful in future.\n\nThis is what is meant in the notes by teaching 'the right thing', it does not mean that the teacher/mentor decides what should be learned and that their decision is carved in stone - but it does recognise the value of their experience. The learner may well question \"Why should I learn WPF when there is so much material on MFC?\" - The learner/mentor will need to answer those questions and answer them honestly. It is at this point that the learner must trust the teacher/mentor to speak honestly (not to misrepresent or use rhetoric to strongarm the learner) and correctly (in this example, to describe accurately the ups and downs of both MFC and WPF).\n\nBasically, to help the learner navigate through an informational overload. The main reason that I started to learn MFC at that time was only because there was such a quantity of material on it which drowned out alternative approaches to Windows programming.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot sure why I felt that I had to mix timetravel into my example, but these things happen. :s\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-28 14:28:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.975530", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 386, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58896, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10601, "post_number": 5, "raw": "\"If you are coming from silicon valley, don't bother applying - we already know you have no ethics\"- overheard in a conversation where someone was recruiting an ethical advisor for their tech company.", "created_at": "2019-09-07 07:46:52.701950", "updated_at": "2019-09-07 07:46:52.701950", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 41.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58840], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60458, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10961, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Dzi\u0119ki wielkie @Barbio - permakultura i ogrody by\u0142yby super, ale mo\u017ce lepiej na wiosn\u0119, kiedy mo\u017cemy zrobi\u0107 to w ogrodzie.

But, even we have to continuously improve our own practices and support others to do the same.\n\nIn 2019 we conducted in depth research on effective practices for distributed and remote work in collaboration with EIT Climate Kic, Europe\u2019s leading Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) working to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon economy. We are currently pulling it all together into an extensive [manual for running distributed teams and organisations](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263).\n\n**During this 20-minute event, Edgeryders will present our research insights around five key areas of good practice: communication, collaboration, socializing, tools and organization building.**\n\nThis event is a friendly space to share and discuss your findings, experiences and good practices with distributed collaboration.

Yes, there are places where you can go in Italy to seek support as a start-up, from the Chamber of Commerce to specific business incubators, but the truth is that most are really difficult to access and in the end offer little real support.

Activities related to the use of speedy vehicles by <i>many </i>people in a society occupy an increasing percentage of the time budget of <i>most </i><font face=\"Xerox Serif Narrow,Times\">members of that society, as the speed of the vehicles increases beyond a certain point. Beyond this point the competition of transportation activities with stationary activities becomes fierce, especially competition for the allocation of limited real estate and available energy. This competition seems to grow exponentially with the rise of speed. The time reserved for commuting displaces both work and leisure time. Hence, the speedier vehicles are, the more it becomes important to keep them filled at all times. If they are individual capsules, they tend to become disproportionately costly and scarce. If they are public vehicles, they tend to be large, and run at infrequent intervals or along only a few routes.</font>\n\n<font face=\"Xerox Serif Narrow,Times\">As speed increases, the adaptation of life patterns to vehicles becomes more tyrannical. It becomes necessary to make constant corrections and amendments to the allocation of shorter periods. It becomes necessary to make appointments and commitments </font>months or even years ahead. Since some of these commitments, which have been made at great cost, cannot be kept, there is a sense of constant failure which produces a sense of constant tension. Man has only a limited ability to submit to programming. When speed increases beyond a certain point, the transportation system vies with other systems in exhausting human tolerance for social controls.\n\nMachines turn against men at a much lower level of power than would be ruled out by the first five criteria. But while these criteria identify necessary safeguards for life and liberty, the <i>balance of purpose </i>depends on a different kind of value. Conceptual rather than empirical criteria can be set for the constitutional limitation of power. It ought to be relatively easy for a majority to rule what abuse it will take from any minority, or what damage it will not expose its offspring to. The recognition of the most socially desirable power of a tool is of a different nature; it can only be the outcome of political procedure. The value obtained for time wasted on speed transportation is conditioned by the consensus in a community about the level of its freedom as a concrete option of its civilization.\n\nTransportation beyond bicycle speeds demands power inputs from the environment. Velocity translates directly into power, and soon power needs increase exponentially. In the United States, 22 percent of the energy converted drives vehicles, and another 10 percent keeps roads open for them. The amount of energy is comparable to the total energy--except for domestic heating-required for the combined economies of India and China. The energy used up in the United States for the sole purpose of driving vehicles built to accelerate beyond bicycle speed would suffice to add auxiliary motors to about twenty times that many vehicles for people all over the world who want to move at bicycle speeds and do not or cannot push the pedals because they are sick or old, or because they want to transport a heavy load or move over a great distance, or because they just want to relax. Simply on the basis of equal distribution on a world-wide scale, speeds above those attained by bicycles could be ruled out. It is of course mere fantasy to assume an egalitarian consensus sufficiently strong to accept such a proposal. At closer inspection though, many com<font face=\"Xerox Serif Narrow,Times\">munities will find that the very same speed limit necessary for equal distribution of mobility is also very close to the optimum velocity giving maximum value to community life. At 20 mph constant speed Phileas Fogg could have made his trip around the world in half of eighty days. Simulation studies would be useful for exploring imaginative policies that seek optimal liberty with convivial power tools. To whose advantage would Calcutta's traffic flow stabilize if speeds were limited to 10 mph? What price would Peru's military pay for limiting the nation's speed to </font>20<b> </b>mph? What gains in equality, activity, health, and freedom would result from limiting all other vehicles to the speed of bicycles and sailing ships?\n\n<small>_(timestamp is wrong due to a Discourse issue when moving posts; correct timestamp is 2014-11-02 12:30pm \u2013 @matthias)_</small>", "created_at": "2017-10-08 22:03:00.293620", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 22:04:21.990020", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 804, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2160], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8423, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1241, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Zero conflicts here!</b>\n\nCiao Andrea, thanks for sharing.\n\nWell, this does seem a story with a happy ending.

I like social systems with an engine of variation (like mutation or sex in biology), and an engine of selection among the variants (like natural selection in biology). In the right conditions, these systems converge: some variants are superior to others, so they outcompete them, and suddenly the species has evolved. I am aware of the problems posed by taking Darwinian evolution as a blueprint for social processes (for one, the variation and selection processes are not independent from each other in most social processes). But still, there is something very appealing in this schema. \n\nBack in the days of the unMonastery, I tried to apply it to [Protocol](/t/4748), a set of low-level rules of interaction for working together.

I am simply chewing it at a higher level of abstraction: collective intelligence is best achieved not by recruiting the smartest people, but by investing in collaboration *practices*. This is absolutely not the same thing as investing in groupware: the world is littered with orgs who spend lots of money tooling up with one or the other project management suites, but when push comes to shove default to unstructured email with heavily formatted MS-Word attachments. Or, even, meetings. No, collaboration practices are really social rules, and require quite some social engineering.

You focus on tools, because your group already has an unspoken agreement that each member is going to make some extra effort to achieve better group-level efficiency. Most groups do not have that.

This world of ours is nearly consumed by hatred which eventually results in conflicts and wars. The prospect of the nation has always remained in the hands of the growing children and youths. \u201cChildren are the nation builders of tomorrow\u201d, this quote clearly defines the importance of children. So we as a part of this project, have to take a step in protecting the children in Nepal after this big Earthquake. Uncountable number of children have been dead and\u00a0badly affected by the past disaster. And we also have seen many groups and individuals helping the. I who had witnessed the disaster in my home have seen some very great and some very cowardly events. So, to have a better and a shining future for Nepal a small solution could be just stopping child labor and to be honest around no child has been getting their right what they should be getting.\u00a0As\u00a0said, 'a small step a big leap for mankind', one small task of just sending children to school and giving them good health and rights might turn out to be a great idea in a way of helping the country in the future. Most of the schools have been damaged in the country and this gives a shock to the education field. therefore we must try our best in helping them. Not long before, a band named 'kutumba' were performing in places and collectiong stationery items for the schools. Now see being on the bright sight, we can see the opportunity that it has given us. It has given us the opportunity to unite again and get back up. To see a ray of right clearly there should be a dark room. So, as this has made the room black. The personalities of the bright people become more brighter as they unite together and the bright future of children becomes the window letting the bright rays come in.\n\n\\#FMC\n\n<span>SXG \u2013 St. Xaviers Godavari school</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-15 13:48:04", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:49:09.941365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 405, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2554, 2851], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15861, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1245, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Is mass action still a source of hope?</b>\n\nHi T (are you the T I know?),\n\ninteresting story.

It seems that there is a belief that important goals can be accomplished by showing up in a public square in large numbers (and certainly the Tahrir experience seems to confirm that). I come from a generation (and a country, Italy) that did that a lot: demonstrations with half a million, even a million people were not that rare. But that did not get us very far: a former Prime Minister, Bettino Craxi, pointed out that one million people in a country with 60 million inhabitants are a minority, and he refused to adjust his policies as a result of protest demonstrations. He promptly got re-elected.\n\nSo what is your perception? At least some young people believe in showing up and occupy stuff. How would this bring about the change they want? Is it good for any kind of change or only for some?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-02 12:46:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:29.035346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 195, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82023, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14245, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-08-18 16:37:07.228654", "updated_at": "2020-08-18 16:37:07.228654", "deleted_at": "2020-08-18 16:37:15.161233", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37908, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 7379, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Last week, the Republican Party here in the U.S. failed in its last attempt to repeal Obamacare\u2014though that isn\u2019t stopping the Trump administration from trying to systematically undo ACA\u2019s provisions.  Meanwhile, last month Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill for universal, single-payer health insurance that has drawn unprecedented levels of support from a broad coalition of democrats. \n\nThere are those enduring acute crises\u2014citizens of Puerto Rico facing an immediate future without electricity and clean water, those suddenly robbed of a loved one in Las Vegas\u2014but for many, life toggles between the perpetual reminders of how bad things are on the news and some more mundane reality.  Even for those for whom the everyday is an enduring state of crisis\u2014the undocumented mother, the uninsured person with a grave illness, the opioid addict, the trans person living in the wrong city\u2014life takes on its daily, unspectacular rhythms, settles into its stabilities. \n\nThere is a lot of doomsday sentiment floating around these days that transcends class and political affiliation.  A devout state policeman who engaged us in conversation when our car ran out of gas on a Virginia freeway said standing by as white nationalists clashed with Antifa in Charlottesville bolstered his belief that the prophecies of Revelations were underway.  Silicon Valley billionaires are designing their post-apocalyptic contingency plans.  The \u201cprepper\u201d industry is thriving.  But, while some live in immediate anticipation of societal collapse, Sanders\u2019 bill reminds us that there is also the capacity for major reform.  The barrage of monster storms and renewed nuclear brinksmanship under the reign of a \u201c[sentient bathroom swastika with the personality of a yeast infection](https://twitter.com/jaboukie/status/911650241832656896)\u201d has snapped even the complacent into some new level of alertness, yet for many, fear and discontent organizes itself around to the liberal horizon of the 2020 presidential elections. \n\nLike others on the radical left, we at Woodbine probably fall closer to the doomsday camp.  Yet, as we take pains to build and broaden our vision, we should imagine not only some Murphy\u2019s Law future of hegemonic fascism or imminent disintegration, but also what the best-case scenarios might be within the present system.  Doing so will help us better delineate the strategic nature of our struggle, and to better articulate the imperative for a truly alternative future.  We should ask ourselves the question: is there a difference between futures that some of us could live with and a universally livable future?     \n\nArmchair radicals are quick to distance themselves from anything that smells of the dreaded _reform_, rather than _revolution_.  Yet, that these radicals tend to be single, white men with limited care duties should make us skeptical of snide, wholesale dismissals.  Expanded state welfare is a good thing.  Yet it is also far from the be all end all of our struggle.  In order to understand why, it helps to turn to the devastating critiques leveled by those who have always been systematically abjected from capitalist society in all its iterations, such as Afropessimists who know that Blackness is what is structurally negated, or Marxist feminists who understand that capitalism will always relegate aspects of care or social reproduction to the realm of the unwaged or onto the shoulders of the most marginalized.  Likewise, health is not simply denied by any one lobby or administration; it is what is negated by capitalist society.  This negation may not be a structural condition in the same way as the extermination of blackness and the subordination of women; in industrial society, capitalism had to take ensure the body of the worker had enough of what it needed to keep returning daily to work.  Within late capitalism, it is the body of the consumer that must be maintained (or the body of the potential angry horde that must be assuaged).  Yet the negation of health has always been one of capitalism\u2019s de facto effects.  The body it preserves is one robbed from us and remade in all its parts according to the profit motive, one pumped full of industrial poisons, one fashioned according to a productive, compliant, white heterocissexist ideal.  \n\nWe can\u2019t let the embattling of our rights defensively delimit our terms.  Take, for instance, the relentless attack on reproductive rights currently underway in this country.  This week, the Trump administration put forth rules that would expand the rights of employers to deny women coverage for birth control.  But should we simply fight to restore the universal coverage mandate for contraceptives under Obama?  If we want women to truly have control over their bodies, we must acknowledge that hormonal birth control\u2014designed to suppress naturally-occurring androgens and so to reduce body hair and acne, often given to teenagers without their full understanding of its effects\u2014is part of a regime that regulates gender and functions within a provider-consumer model of care that robs people of agency over their bodies (as [Luiza Prado de O. Martins](https://www.academia.edu/24586798/Pills_genders_and_design_Speculations_on_Queer_Materialities) explains, these \u201csexopolitical\u201d medications can also be \u201c(mis)used to articulate new ways of doing gender,\u201d but these ways deviate from the medicalized norm).  We need to do more than argue for the restoration or the expansion of a system that has enabled liberation for some (with liberation being the freedom to join the workforce), while cruelly oppressing others\u2014think of the eugenicist policies U.S. institutions have carried out against Native, Latin, and Black Americans.      \n\nIn August, my gig as a graduate student will be up and I will lose my health insurance.

I am running a well positionned space in Medenine, I was able to overcome so many diffuculties and I am going to sum up my first year in numbers:\n- More than 30 events were organized.\n- More than 1000 persons were touched through those events.\n- +/- 20 persons come to our space daily, and what I am proud of is that more than 70% from them are women, knowing that Medenine is a \"conservative region\" and it is not an easy thing to gain the trust of Girls, and their parents to go to a public, \"mixed\" place on a daily basis! Super proud of that! if I did that myslef, but then what if ourghema gets bigger and I don't do that only myself but with the support of a greater community? \n\nSo my plans are currently:\n-  starting the **hackerspace** that I started working on already, and it is going to be through a partnership with someone from Medenine ([3D Protoksi](https://www.facebook.com/3dprotoksi/)) , as he is an expert in 3D priniting, (Currently, I am thinking of reaching more people, so I believe that with this partnership, and the support / partnership with Ibtakiroo association, we will be able to reach more people and have a greater impact, more than when ourghema works by itself) \n- Focusing on the high school students in this year, and this is a strategic decision as I do believe that they will be the ones who will be making change in Medenine in the coming ten years, so investing in them is quite a great idea! for instance, I am going to make an **Ideas Camp** which is a big event and this event is funded by **l'institut Fran\u00e7ais** and supported by the incubator **Labe'ess** and, since we already have the  **Oci Lab** incubator doing great job in Tunisia, I thought that they should be part of the Ideas Camp, through having sohayeb and Zmorda as trainers / supervisors, ( Ideas Camp is an event that will work on the tools of processing ideas and how to turn them into impactful actions, after this event, we will continue on working with the participants, whom will be divided into three groups, eachgroup will come up with a social idea after the camp, and work on it in the next three months, with the incubation of the space ! But since we already have OCI LAB, I believe it will be a great thing that they incubate these participants and include them in their program as well :slight_smile:\n\nso back to my question, What is next? my answer is that Ourghema will launch a fablab, and then launch an incubator, we will be incubating the young change makers of the south of Tunisia, in a continuing process, and through reaching a larger community, our first incubation experience will be in the coming months and I am excited about it! \n\n @nadia, we have had a discussion in Washington one year ago, about linking different social spaces like ourghema in the MENA  region and each space support the other,  @alberto  suggested something similar as well in the Hackathon, and @matthias suggested the same in this [post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/proposal-for-a-network-of-openvillage-houses/6785/3)  ! can we go further with these suggestions? \nAlso, a great coinsidence, I met Mr. Mahmoud Mohieldin VP of the world bank for the 2030 development agenda, in the World Forum Convergences held in Paris, and  both of him and his colleague were impressed by the work ourghema is doing and we are currently discussing if the IFC can help in anyway the space (I hope  it will work!)  \nSo many things are happening, and I wanted to see if Ourghema, and Edgeryders can go further together! \n\nPing @Sohayeb

It's the most petty one of all. Apt for those who want to profit from eymployees in a mechanical way which does not have to imply any generosity, care or adherence to society as a whole. This petty joy-based accounting of course also binds much resources just for accounting itself ... and for checking that the employees work ...\n\nBut now that \"we\" as Western society have taken hundreds of years to develop and refine this accounting based system of paid jobs, and all of us got raised in it, I doubt it could easily change on large scale to something like the communal work found in some African tribes. Or just to basic income - we have that discussion again in Germany, but it's stuck in its infancy. We're infected with a renitent meme and have no quick way out (as a whole society, not as individuals).\n\nBut the first step is unlearning this mindset and these values that ties us to organize work in jobs.

progressives/Democrats have a 2/3 majority in both houses and every elected statewide official including the Governor. \u00a0And an economy bigger than France. \u00a0I see some Trumpsters from time to time around\u00a0here, but not much. \u00a0In Oakland Trump only got 4% of the vote.\n\nI also agree that climate change is driving much of this, exacerbated by overpopulation, loss of topsoil, good water and other resources. \u00a0In other words, the environmnet - the earth itself - is driving much of the angst, whether some know it or not, or admit it.\n\nI get the feeling this \"collaborative politicvs\" is a kind of \"think globally, act locally\" idea you are putting forth, but with the addition of \"be networked.\" \u00a0If so, I like it. \u00a0And an interesting sort of koan when it goes along with, \"we<b>\u00a0</b>propose<b>\u00a0</b>building a political terrain that is so<b>\u00a0</b>hyperlocal and fragmented...\"\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-30 19:11:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.864624", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 327, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81646, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 14240, "post_number": 1, "raw": "```\n{\n\t\"data\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Alberto Cottica\",\n\t\t\t\"subtitle\": \"<a href='http://live.edgeryders.eu/13896' target='_blank'>Founder, Science Fiction Economics Lab</a>\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e81cd9a856559dc926253b81838a244b0c1d8f59.jpeg\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Gaetano Giunta\",\n\t\t\t\"subtitle\": \"<a href='http://fdcmessina.org/' target='_blank'>Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 di Messina</a>\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7bb2f63c7fc406ca95f31b51a5530ef47d716459.jpeg\"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```", "created_at": "2020-08-11 20:59:36.955611", "updated_at": "2020-08-11 21:00:31.989160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45379, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8648, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Setting as dropped.", "created_at": "2018-06-04 22:18:37.971959", "updated_at": "2018-06-04 22:18:37.971959", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81647, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 14240, "post_number": 2, "raw": "![speaker_1|690x389](upload://x7mAeGAv6lQyLjW1QsgdIUN97cd.jpeg) ![speaker_2|689x386](upload://hEi9tGnqieGJn4qSRculVKlWP4l.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-08-11 21:00:06.916269", "updated_at": "2020-08-11 21:00:06.916269", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62186, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 11253, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_To bring SciFi Econ Lab in front of as many eyeballs as possible, we need the help of our frenemy, Facebook._\n\n_Here are some copy ideas for an ad campaign that is set to be launched to Brussels and surrounding cities, adjust and amend as necessary:_ \n\n<hr>\n\n**Ad #1: Target audience is people who already are familiar with ER**\n<hr>\n\nToday's economy has lost the radicalism of Marx and Keynes, the audacity of the Fourier, Owens and Olivetti.\n\nTo create a new economy, that will contribute to a more humane, green and fair world; we're inviting science fiction writers to Brussels on November 11th to bring ideas from their 'fictional economies' to life, so together we can create a new economy.\n\nTo make this happen, we started a crowdfunding campaign where everyone can get involved in creating a new economy (and those who cannot join us in Brussels, there will be live-stream available!): \n\n<hr>\n\n**Ad #2: Target audience is Cory Doctorow fans**\n<hr>\n\n\"We're not doing nations anymore.

Allowing that some people do not matter, as things are turning out, allows that other people do not matter and those cracks are widening to swallow up more and more people.

He does a lot of gardening. I mean a lot. He grows everything from seeds. He has about 10 varieties of rasberries and blackberries, even yellow rasberries and black rasperries. I had never seen anything like it! He grows kiwis in a zone 3 climate (he managed to find a variety that supports cold temperatures). He knows about every new garden plant that exists. He spends hours on the Internet learning about garden plants.\n\nHe makes his own yogourt. He bakes muffins for his family.

Ja na primjer mogu biti u samo dvije situacije: Kad puno radim, imam para ali nemam vremena i onda placam za usluge koje ne mogu sam odraditi. Ako malo radim ja nemam para ali imam puno vremena, i onda to vreme kao najvrijedniji resurs ulazem na najbolji moguci nacin.

Ovo su vrlo konkretne stvari, jer ja nemam vremena za gluposti. Zasto mislis da ce se ti ljudi aktivirati kad budu dobijali minimalni dohodak kad CAK I SAD KAD IM TREBAJU PARE, oni ih odbijaju to jest ne zele uci u vrata koja su im otvorena i provjeriti kakve su mogucnosti na drugoj strani?

Simple reasons: no / intermittent / slow mobile data connections, data connections are expensive, literacy limitations, difficulties typing in non-Lating characters on smartphones etc..\n\nFor inspiration, I share with you the best approach for a rural social network that I have found so far: <span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.gramvaani.org/\">Gramvaani</a>.

Back in old times of paper phonebooks, businesses would pay 20-40 USD equiv. per year to be listedin the \"Yellow Pages\". A digital equivalent embedded into a rural social network could be both useful and (on scale) profitable. Maybe? Just, I'd stay away from anything pay-per-click. It's so dead.

His professional experience enabled him to understand the needs of citizens and the constraints of a public system.\n\nHe is worried about the lack of public confidence in their representatives and civic disengagement. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and his family witnessed a coup in Haiti in September 1990. Two weeks of constant gun shots around his house in this country opened his eyes. He knows how we too easily take democracy for granted, how precious it really is.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois believes in leveraging technology to render public services more efficient. During a strategic consulting assignment at the Treasury Board of the government of Quebec, he became aware of the potential of open government. An \"awesome discovery\", he said. He realized that technology tools available today can be integrated to a government within a structured approach, something useful to increase public confidence. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois sees how transparency and information flow increases public trust, improve policy makers accountability, and can increase the level of performance of public agencies. He likes how open government brings a unifying vision of business that can help meet the challenges of government budget constraints.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois also has a keen interest in developing multilateral partnerships that will support development of open government initiatives in the French speaking countries. He's a founding member of recently launched <a href=\"http://www.democratieouverte.org/\">Democratieouverte.org</a>.\n\n<strong>Read more about Jean-Fran\u00e7ois</strong>\n\n\u2015 Mon cheminement vers le gouvernement ouvert <a href=\"/t/mon-cheminement-vers-le-gouvernement-ouvert/1259\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/mon-cheminement-vers-le-gouvernement-ouvert</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-05 19:38:24", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:48:46.410155", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37723, "user_id": 3595, "topic_id": 7170, "post_number": 44, "raw": "@natalia_skoczylas  I could help you the 19th with the cooking", "created_at": "2017-10-06 13:01:29.480525", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 13:01:29.480525", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58669, "user_id": 5277, "topic_id": 10640, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Whoa, I am surprised but happy :blush: actually i didn't thought at all bout any price because it was just nice and enriching to speak with interviewer and to try to look at own way of thinging about social problems in Poland from bigger perspective.", "created_at": "2019-09-02 11:36:06.085118", "updated_at": "2019-09-02 11:36:06.085118", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58557], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60863, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11041, "post_number": 3, "raw": "ping @anon82932460 and @MariaEuler and @inge", "created_at": "2019-10-08 06:03:36.420591", "updated_at": "2019-10-08 06:03:36.420591", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 38.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4986], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79813, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 13939, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Useful article: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/opinion-broadnax-afrofuturism-black-panther_n_5a85f1b9e4b004fc31903b95\n\nAfrofuturism is built around the idea of authenticity.

We don't have that yet, but we could do so before the application deadline.\n\n* **Registering a branch office in Nepal.** According to the startup support company (lawyers, accountants etc.) that Anu talked to, registering Edgeryders in Nepal is easily possible and can be done (in expedited form) within one week by that startup support company. We can opt to either register a dependent or independent branch office \u2013 both is fine and the admin complexity it entails on the Nepal side is similar. The difference seems to be if the branch office receives payments from clients directly or via the main office. **EDIT:** Though the startup support company did not mention it, I am pretty sure we will have to sign some paper documents and deliver them to Nepal as originals. Still possible by courier service, but will add to the cost and make keeping the deadline more difficult.\n\n* **Paying taxes in Nepal.** We'd have to pay taxes in Nepal for profits generated by the branch office in Nepal. There might be discounts / tax-exemptions for us because the Edgeryders branch office would be registered as an INGO type organization inside Nepal \u2013 this applies, because we are a not-for-profit company in our home country. Tax formalities in Nepal are said to be \"simple\" and can be handled by that startup support company for us.\n\n* **Cost of registration.** The cost for the expedited branch office registration is 60,000 NPR (450 EUR). This includes everything incl. the required translation and notarization of Edgeryders' company documents in Nepali.\n\n**My take:** This tender is strange because it has a tight time between publication and deadline (one month) and extreme formal requirements that I don't know from other UN tenders: local presence, local registration certificate, two years of audited accounts etc.. So it _might_ be one of these public procurements that are somehow already decided or nearly decided internally. Means, it does not make much sense to invest long hours and 450 EUR and to accept permanent liabilities for making tax statements etc. in Nepal just to apply here. Esp. given these costs, it's a bit much of effort for an application \u2026\n\nHowever, it's great that now we know how we can register in Nepal once we want to.

Unlike some European languages that distinguish between \"formal/informal\" personal pronouns, such as Spanish: tu/usted, English no longer makes those distinctions. So, it's interesting that a machine-learning powered translation tool would default to the formal (though, in this case, DeepL offers alternative translations at the bottom of the screen using the second person singular, \"du\"). The interesting thing about DeepL is that, in contrast to Linguee, it *generates* text for proposed translations, but like Linguee, it reflects cultural norms of politeness.\n\nI tried a few different translations and found that the only time DeepL defaulted to \"du\" instead of \"Sie\" is when there was very explicit intimacy between the subject and the object of the sentence, for example: \"I love *you*\", translated to \"Ich liebe *dich*\", or \"*you* are my eldest child\" translated to \"*du* bist mein \u00e4ltestes Kind\". But that did not work every time: \"*you* are my wife\" translated to \"*Sie* sind meine Frau\", \"*you* are my favourite niece\", translated to \"*Sie* sind meine lieblings Nichte\". It also translated this expert from a T.S. Eliot poem, with the formal pronoun: ![34|689x147](upload://k1zyW7P1EKK055VBAQSJop3y3ZI.png)\n\nIt would be interesting to learn more about how DeepL learns; if it learns for example from a social *context* in which polite/formal forms of address are used more frequently, or if it responds to the *content* of a sentence and suggests formal and informal forms of address depending on that, or if it learns from individual *users* using certain forms of address more frequently than others.", "created_at": "2020-05-09 12:14:15.368399", "updated_at": "2020-05-09 12:14:15.368399", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 62.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4934, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14219, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1131, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Simon, thanks so much!</b>\n\nMy fault.

It takes some time to figure out.\u00a0\n\nMatt has\u00a0now implemented an auto-follow feature: when you comment something, by default you follow it too (users can always unfollow follow anything).

A la suite de cela, j'ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une profession davantage en conformit\u00e9 avec mes valeurs.\n## Quelle est ton exp\u00e9rience du co-housing?\nJ\u2019ai v\u00e9cu \u00e0 Forest (Bruxelles) chez  mes parents jusqu\u2019\u00e0 mes 20 ans.\n\nJ\u2019ai aussi v\u00e9cu en colocation et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t positive. Par exemple, lorsqu\u2019on rentre chez soi, on n\u2019est pas seul, on peut retrouver un ou l\u2019autre colocataire dans la partie commune. La possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer des repas en commun me plaisait \u00e9galement. J\u2019en garde de bons souvenirs.\n\nEnsuite, j'ai eu la chance d'avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un logement social, seule avec ma fille.\n\nActuellement, j\u2019habite avec mon enfant dans un logement social \u00e0 Namur. Mais la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de gestion du logement social  n'est pas forc\u00e9ment championne en termes de gestion et de m\u00e9diation entre les voisins. Si un groupe de voisins d\u00e9cide de s\u2019organiser entre eux, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re le voit d\u2019un mauvais oeil. \n\n## Qu'est-ce qu\u2019il te manque dans ta situation actuelle?\nPrincipalement les liens sociaux au quotidien. A mon avis, il faudrait construire plus de \u201cmaisons de quartier\u201d. Des espaces o\u00f9 les voisins peuvent se rencontrer, passer plus de moments ensemble. Apprendre \u00e0 se conna\u00eetre. Mener des actions pour am\u00e9liorer le quartier ou simplement se lier et faire connaissance, en jouant \u00e0 des jeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par exemple ou encore en organisant une sortie ensemble, etc.\n\nEt, comme on est quand m\u00eame en 2019, ne faisons pas l\u2019impasse sur le num\u00e9rique ! Pour cr\u00e9er des liens dans mon quartier, j\u2019utilise [Hoplr](https://www.hoplr.com/), une app qui voudrait devenir un r\u00e9seau social local pour chaque quartier en Belgique.\n\nUne autre solution serait de cr\u00e9er un \u00e9change de services ou d\u2019objets \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 disposition d\u2019autres colocataires ou habitants: par exemple, le pr\u00eat d\u2019une  visseuse. D\u2019ailleurs, j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment un chouette gar\u00e7on qui s\u2019appelle Guillaume Dupont qui est en train de cr\u00e9er une app pour \u00e7a qui s\u2019appelle [Lendland.](https://lendland.be/)\n\n## Quelles limites fixes-tu au partage d\u2019un habitat group\u00e9?\nMa coloc Caro \u00e9tait une artiste un peu folle, et souvent elle invitait des amies artistes pour dormir chez nous. Au d\u00e9but, c\u2019est rigolo mais apr\u00e8s, \u00e7a devient un peu lourd parce que je ne trouvais plus d\u2019espace pour moi m\u00eame, pour \u00eatre toute seule dans mon univers particulier. \n\nMon copain \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque n'habitait pas dans l'appart. Il venait aussi dormir de temps en temps car venant de l'ext\u00e9rieur. Ca aussi, \u00e7a a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 des tensions parfois.\n\nDans une autre coloc, ma chambre \u00e9tait au-dessous d'une cuisine. Pas id\u00e9al, \u00e0 cause des odeurs. \n## Que ferais-tu pour am\u00e9liorer ton logement aujourd\u2019hui?\nOn pourrait \u00e9largir l\u2019id\u00e9e du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail dans diff\u00e9rents lieux. Il y des espaces qui ne sont occup\u00e9s que la journ\u00e9e de 9 \u00e0 17h mais qui sont vides le soir et aussi \u00e0 l\u2019inverse. Comment faire pour mettre en relation et synchroniser les propri\u00e9taires d\u2019espaces et les coworkers? Je connais Vincent de Waele qui a lanc\u00e9 l\u2019initiative [Hoffice.](https://www.meetup.com/Hoffice-Brussels/) Avec \u00e7a, tu peux ouvrir ta maison pour la transformer en espace de coworking pour 6 heures de 9h \u00e0 17h. \n\n## Comment con\u00e7ois-tu un habitat partag\u00e9 id\u00e9al \u00e0 Bruxelles?\n\nL\u2019habitat group\u00e9 c'est la formule qui r\u00e9pond le mieux \u00e0 mes attentes. Par ailleurs, je vois que ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne fait de plus en plus d\u2019\u00e9mules de nos jours. J\u2019ai visit\u00e9 pas mal d'habitats group\u00e9s et des communaut\u00e9s ces derniers temps.\n\nIl faut \u00e9galement prendre en compte l'environnement, le d\u00e9veloppement durable et la mobilit\u00e9. C\u2019est le nouveau paradigme de vivre ensemble en respectant l'environnement. \nJe m'int\u00e9resse aussi aux mod\u00e8les d\u2019entreprises alternatifs : inclure dans l\u2019habitat des acteurs \u00e0 but lucratif pourrait faciliter un apport de fonds additionnels au projet qui pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour subventionner des membres d\u2019un habitat ayant moins de ressources. \n\nIl faut faire confiance au temps. D\u00e8s qu\u2019on s\u00e8me des graines, quelque chose est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se produire.\n\n## Quel est ton exp\u00e9rience de connection avec la ville ?\nMoi, j'ai eu la chance de participer \u00e0 une des premi\u00e8res exp\u00e9riences de d\u00e9mocratie participative. Cet projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en 2004, \u00e0 Forest et St Gilles autour du parc Duden. C\u2019\u00e9tait un travail collectif avec les habitants. Des assembl\u00e9es citoyennes proposaient aux pouvoirs publics les points \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer dans l\u2019espace public. Et les autorit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ravies du r\u00e9sultat.\n\n## Tu te vois en train d'habiter un lieu comme The Reef?\n\nTout \u00e0 fait. En fait, moi j'habite \u00e0 Namur mais ma prochaine \u00e9tape de vie va se passer dans le projet Calico de CLBT. Je pense que \u00e7a va \u00eatre un niveau sup\u00e9rieur par rapport au logement social actuel. \n\nMais pour que l\u2019entreprise soit couronn\u00e9e de succ\u00e8s, on va devoir se retrousser les manches sur la gouvernance, notamment avec une charte de fonctionnement \u00e9volutive. Comment on va vivre ensemble? Le r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateur-facilitateur est primordial pour \u00e9laborer cette charte. \n\n## Qui d\u2019autre pourrait s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 ce projet ?\n\nTout personne soucieuse de vivre quelque chose de plus harmonieux avec plus de vie, plus de nature dans la ville. Aujourd'hui, on en a tellement besoin.\n\n## Ateliers en cours \nLa communaute de The Reef est active en Novembre. Il y a 2 ateliers qui vont discuter different aspects du logement a Bruxelles. Welcom! \n\n[Living Green (14 Nov)](https://www.facebook.com/events/373242303584830/)\nL\u2019atelier rassemble des personnes qui habitent Bruxelles et qui aspirent \u00e0 vivre de mani\u00e8re abordable, \u00e9cologique et en interaction sociale avec d\u2019autres, des personnes qui tentent de d\u00e9velopper des modes de vies durables et qui souhaitent partager, des personnes qui veulent apprendre des autres.\n[Sprint to the Reef (28 Nov)](https://www.facebook.com/events/2348921238692004/)\nNombre d\u2019entre nous partagent de l\u2019espace avec d\u2019autres que ce soit pour vivre ou pour travailler.

I just want to add a small, still very relevant detail: during the conversation with the Dionisos one of the participants asked G and L how important was the relationship not just between Dioniso and the shopkeeper but also between Dioniso and the other citizens, the neighborhood for instance... This question addressed specifically the thesis that it would be cool to create awareness around the accessibility issue, involving more people in the process, resulting in a more helpful environment. Well, the answer was, somehow suprisingly, that this process of awareness creation is not a priority, the priority is accessing places, feeling the freedom to go wherever I want to. For instance, a place like a supermarket or a big chain retail shop (they usually have concrete ramps) where I can enter without even anyone noticing is always a preferred solution!\n\nNow, to reply to your question, this last insight and the ones you have listed above slightly changed our perspective on the problem, and for sure they\u00a0did change design parameters. How? One thing that came out early during the conversation\u00a0is that Dioniso would like to know in advance if a place is accessible or not. This is something Dioniso is already doing with existing tools (Google street map was given as an example), but can be highly improved. This kick started a topic around mapping and tools like wheelmap (which our Dionisos didn't even know existed...) and around seamless not-in-person communication between Dioniso and the shopkeeper.\n\nWhat next? @lorenzo just started drawing scenarios and in the next days will work on rough prototyping 2/3 of these scenarios that will be showcased and tested during the meeting on June 21st.\n\nHe'll be the person to go to for everything related to the \"call\" experience from now on :)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-05 09:13:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.774073", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30403], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75425, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 13309, "post_number": 28, "raw": "[quote=\"Alessandro, post:25, topic:13309\"]\nAlright, thanks.

They are a tool to complement current actions on procurement and local agency as in this kind of SLA it does not matter that the original data sets and analytical platforms are not under your control.

Until I met artist Sophia Brueckner, who taught me that the problem was more complicated than I had assumed. My concern deepened as I learned more about ethical problems in AI. Our policies could not possibly keep pace with technological advancements and would lead to greater inequality in society. I grew critical. Why were regulatory and other societal institutions not doing anything? Later, I met the CASBS director Margaret Levi, who informed me that many institutions were working on this \u2013 I just did not know them.\n> \n> The following map is an attempt to document and clarify my learning through a compositional research process.

No words are ever changed, nor is anything eliminated that alters the intent of the speaker, regardless of who it is.\n- Send the edited text through the otter.ai transcribing machine and save it as raw text (not Word).\n- Match the text up with the audio to clean up Otter's errors.\n- Post it on the platform as audio and text, bringing it to the attention of the participants, ethnographer coders and general ER members.\n\nThis came up in a discussion about how to make the process more efficient if possible. But Alberto brought up the point that in some ethnography the coders prefer the text to be raw, including all vocal tics.  I have been making these edits to something closer to a radio-ready standard, although given that most of the speakers are not native English speakers, the text invariably reflects this to some degree (which I think is acceptable).  So I have not sought perfect, but acceptable to an average listener. Again, with the intent of having something that works for coders and adds worthwhile content to the platform and perhaps gives us something worth telling the outside world about.\n\nAnd, importantly, I considered it a courtesy to the coders to not make them suffer through too much difficulty trying to read an unedited, or shall I say not cleaned-up, text. And Amelia made it clear that they prefer dealing with the text.

Not sharing the same language can be difficult too, but I've helped many people talking in a language that is neither their not my mother language. Also, communication is larger than words: expression, visual support, eye contact and even touch can be means of understanding and helping too. When their is no common language, I work with a translator sometimes too.\n\nAs for Medecins sans fronti\u00e8res, I applied for a position in the field - but was not accepted. Like many 'traditional' NGO's they have quite rigid and out-of-date conditions of admission - like requiring a master degree in psychology. I have a master in philosophy, 4 years of study in psychotherapy and a specialisation in psychotraumatalogy plus 10 years of experience. Nevertheless I do not meet the 'official' requirements. The recognition of psychotherapy as a valid profession is a complex issue and one that is colonized in Belgium by the medical professions, which is the mean reason why people like me, highly skilled psychotherapists,\u00a0 are not recognized as such.

Furthermore, any smart city project must be carbon-neutral, or at the very least have a carbon footprint an order of magnitude smaller than the existing systems it replaces or augments.\n\n<hr>\n\n# Frequently asked questions\n###  How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?\n**Fill in this form: https://register.edgeryders.eu/**\n\n_Please note: This event is bringing together people who are currently directly involved in building, researching, regulating, monetising and or providing meaningful input into the wider debate around the technologies in question.

If price tags, values, quantifications are created to commoditize nature and enrich the private sector, then it is a danger more than a progress. But if a commons sector is created along side the public and private sector with new types of institutions based on cooperative stewardhip or trusteeship, then putting tags and values is a way to ensure that those who use these resources for commercial purposes don't deplete them and take care of replenishing them. It's using the financial metrics and accounting systems to rein in on abuse and overexploitation of the commons and reverse the destruction. On an epistemological and ideological point of view the issue may be controversatial, I agree...\u00a0 I see this as a transtion to change behaviors an move towards totally new paradigms.

It is not a single organization, rather a set of interconnected cooperatives, working closely together.\n\nI am not going to try to summarize the report here. Yet again, the model it outlines is so different from run-of-the-mill late-stage capitalism that it might as well be describing  some alien planet in a work of SF. I just want to note what seem to be the highlights of their economic model:\n\n1. ***Very* militant attitude**. Its one-time charismatic leader, Enric Duran, came to the fore for tricking Spanish banks into lending him half a million euro which he promptly gave away to various anti-globalization activist projects, in a kind of Robin Hood gesture. In 2013 he had to go to ground in order to avoid prison. It does not seem, however, that this money was directly used to capitalize CIC.\n2. **Legal orgs as infrastructure for people's businesses and projects**. CIC has spawned a series of companies that act as legal vehicles for about 600 people to issue invoices. This is, to the people in question, cheaper than setting themselves up as independent workers under the Spanish system. They do pay a fee to these companies.\n3. **CIC itself has no legal status**. Despite this, it is very much real: a set of committees, which meet weekly, run the show. Committee members are paid \u2013 they call their monies \"basic income\". There are about 10 full-time jobs equivalent in running CIC.\n4. **Decentralized by design**: CIC is constantly spawning new cooperatives, that initially rely on CIC's support to get by. The successful ones, like [Calafou](/t/2409) have become fully autonomous. \n5. **Two currencies**. CIC operates both in EUR and in ECO, Catalonia's local currency. There is also a system of mutual credit, which is similar to [PayCoupons](/t/8417), though not as sophisticated.\n6. **Real estate excess capacity**. Many of the central features in CIC's economic landscape have developed around the availability of cheap buildings ([AureaSocial](http://www.aureasocial.org/), [Som Pujarnol](https://www.facebook.com/people/Som-Pujarnol/100010861595073)) or even entire villages (Calafou). Physical spaces appear to be like bioreactors for innovative social dynamics and bnusiness models.  \n7. **Focus on public/common goods**. CIC puts a lot of effort in making things that then can serve as an enabling platform for whatever the people in it might want to do. They have companies as a legal shell for freelance work, two-sided markets for labor and products, a logistic system for food products, a cooperative for mutual and self-financing, a science and technology networks, and some real-estate based projects. \n8. **Dyson sphere**. The system of small businesses surrounding CIC attempts to \"capture\" all the revenue that might come from the outside of the system. For example, suppose I had a client asking me to organize a workshop on network science.  As I do that, I am going to try to send some business the way of other people in the system. Perhaps my client needs a venue: does anyone in the CIC space have one? What about the catering service? Etc. \n\nThe list above is interesting, because we in the Sci-Fi Economics Lab have seen some of its items before. 4, 7 and 8 are also part of the model in Messina's social district. Edgeryders itself also does 7, in a fashion limited to software and knowledge so far. We also do 2, though not nearly as successful as CIC. \n\nI hope that, as we continue the exploration of alt-economies, a convergence will emerge. By this I mean a set of strategies that several initiatives have independently hit upon, and work reasonably well under a variety of circumstances. These might be some of the building blocks for the new economic systems we are longing for. \n\nIf you know any interesting initiative that attempts to build an alternative economic system, I would be grateful for pointers. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-06-15 10:13:46.747816", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 07:48:46.339177", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 692, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 1710.2, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5268, 8, 2915, 428, 6679, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77581, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13691, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@hugi renamed 'sections' to 'blocks' fyi  :)\n```\nblocks:\n  - type: Content\n    id: about\n    views:\n      text:\n      - Some custom text\n      - Another section of text\n```\n\nIs the correct form. see the example here for reference: https://edgeryders.eu/t/webkit-sandbox-yaml/13668", "created_at": "2020-05-28 00:13:03.116049", "updated_at": "2020-05-28 02:33:34.602424", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72276, "user_id": 3782, "topic_id": 12945, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Our aim to start Didi Asks was to enhance communication that we believe nurture social connection that has the potential to become your support network.

while this approach is easy to measure and manage, it's also a very blunt instrument, especially when within industry, we know that our knowledge about how to do _almost anything in a measurably low carbon way_ is so poor.\n\n### What can we use to explore the impacts of service design to highlight unintended consuquences and risks early?\n\nSo, one goal is workshop is partly to explore what _is_ out there, to come up with a vocabulary to talk about service design, so we can talk about reducing carbon emissions in how we work, so we have names for patterns the same way when we talk about _channel shifting_, we know it entails.\n\nBut there is also a second goal of being able to talk about the trade-offs we make when doing so, so we can avoid the unintended consequences of how we might work.\n\nFinally, there is a need to help share knowledge about what kinds of tools or probes are effective in reaching these first two goals\n \n## Prior work we might discuss, or share experiences of using \n\n### Inspiration from industrial product design\n\nThere are tools and frameworks for product design, to help us understand the non-monetary impacts of what we build.\n\nBelow is a _Materials, Energy, People Matrix_, proposed by [Dr Isabel Ordonez](https://research.chalmers.se/en/person/imaria), as a tool based on the more common [MET (Material, Energy Toxicity) matrix](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MET_Matrix) used in industrial design education.\n\nIt's designed to help guide a systematic review of the impacts of a making a product, in each use-phase of it's existence, and can be used for a very quick [life cycle analysis/assessment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment).\n\n\n![02|690x398](upload://7jOBKZvZ1zSlz6o8EbZe3A818HF.jpeg) \n\nIt's a useful framework for thinking about the impact of products, and it share the same approach of splitting the use of a product that journey maps, and experience maps like below, that we have for service design.\n\n### Comparable tools in service design\n\nWe already have some tools that help us talk about phases of use or experience when we think about designing services.\n\nBut if there are few tools to support discussion of the environmental or social impacts the way a MEP matrix might, discourse and experience reports are even rarer.\n\n![05|690x517](upload://6Qiv87irNoAbkqwjcwgK0XAMPKG.jpeg) \n\nAlso, while user-centred design is increasingly common, we have few tools for designing for people who are not the _primary_ users of services, a key consideration when designing for the wider environment.\n\nFor example, Airbnb is a great example of user-centred design for the end user.\n\nIt's a less successful example of design for the neighbour of a person hosting an apartment, or less visible people, like the cleaners and other workers who are also part of the supply chain. \n\nOne possible way to frame this has been the citizen - city continuum proposed by Dan Hill when describing how we design services in future.\n\n![11|690x299](upload://ewPvucnh9asn8cH7fFsd3ek1O4k.png) \n\nAnother visual model, is is Stewart Brand's pace layers, initially used for architecture, to help architects think about the changes they might make to a building, to make the space better suited for it intended purpose.\n\n![01|690x372](upload://fJlPpvPKWB5d8FKhsTieytqownR.jpeg) \n\nSimilar to how you might design with these pace layers in mind  when designing an architectural intervention in a space, you might do something similar when designing services.\n\nYou might deliberately, and explicitly make changes to a service in ways that refer to different layers, given a finite budget of financial and social capital.\n\n\n## Possible outputs from the workshop\n\n#### 1. A greater understanding where we need to describe and create patterns, so we have the words to talk about service design in the context of carbon reductions.\n\nA gap analysis informed by experience reports from practitioners, about what are the key issues needed to explore - this might confirm the initial ideas in this workshop, or bring up other key ideas related to service design in a climate emergency.\n\n_**Workshop note:** An activity like [1-2-4-All][] from Liberating structures would be a tried and tested, well documented way to get rich feedback from a mixed group of participatants when looking to answer a specific question_\n\n[1-2-4-All]: http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/\n\n_1-2-4-All can be run very quickly, but often around 40mins to an hour is set aside to explore a single question_\n\n#### 2. A survey of the existing activities, frameworks and tools available to designers, and where they are useful.\n\nThis would help understand which questions the tools and frameworks we have available are suited to answering, which ones they aren't. Being able to check these common tools we know against the key challenges identified in the first output would let give us an idea of what new tools might look like.\n\n_**Workshop note:** you might use an activity like [post-up] in groups to generate a list of the tools and frameworks, represented by sticky-notes, before removing duplicates in a shared list created by combining the groups._\n\n_You might then plot these on some kind of visual axis, or diagram for where they are effective, like the ones presented above from user - city continuum from Dan Hill, or the pace layers Steward Brand, or another relevant model._\n\n_This would provide the basis for creating the next output._\n\n_Depending on how much time you might allow for discussion, how many groups you work in, and how large a shared list is, this might take between 30-90 minutes_\n\n#### 3. Some visual representation of the issues and which tools described might be useful.\n\nEarlier designers and thinkers have explored questions like this before - their diagrams or visual models are useful tools, and spending time to sketching out some ideas during the day, that might build on this may be similarly useful.\n\nThis will highlight directions for future research, or development of prototype tools to aid in discussions.\n\n_**Workshop note:** Once the groups have had a chance to explore the issues, and try using some existing visual models or diagrams, using an approach like design studio, or crazy 8's to come up with a large number low fidelity visual models or diagrams, before refining and reducing these to a smaller number of higher quality diagrams would help create with the creation of future tools, mental models or frameworks, to share, and try out in future projects._\n\n_A design studio exercise like this might typically take between 30-60 mins_\n\n### Related projects:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@cassierobinson/beyond-human-centred-design-to-501a994f3123\n\n\nhttps://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/welcome-sharetown/\n\nhttps://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/the-city-is-my-homescreen-317673e0f57a\n\n# Wishlist\n\n_Which skills would we like to have in the room?_\n\n- Service design skills, particularly working in public sector in Europe, and private sector\n- Policy design and experience, particularly for delivering carbon reductions in government services\n- Digital skills, for implementing digitally mediated aspects of a service, like building digital platforms designed to support a channel shift away from manual ones that relied on paper\n- Skills and experience at working with vulnerable groups (or people from those groups themselves), often impacted by the unintended consequences of people taking steps to 'green' a service.\n\n_Are there specific organisations whose contributions would be helpful?_\n\n- The folks behind the Global Design Jam Series have experience facilitating events, and are often staffed by professional service designers\n- There is a unit at TU Berlin focussed on \u201csustainable digitalisation\u201d - their contributions would be useful\n- Groups like Tactical tech or Engine Room, have experience working with groups who are often vulnerable, and marginalised, and have put work into helping organisations understand how their efforts might unintentionally harm the people they are trying to help\n- In Berlin, groups who are working to build digital services that displace more polluting alternatives would be useful to have present, as they can talk about the trade-offs they need to make, when operating commercially. Examples might be mobility services companies like the ones running Coup, Emmy, and so on\n\n# Questions to explore\n\n- What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ?\n \n- How do we avoid the unintended consequences in a world of binding legal carbon reduction targets?\n\n- What can we use to explore the impacts of service design to highlight unintended consequences and risks early?\n\n<hr>\n\n# Frequently asked questions\n\n### How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?\n\n**Complete the registration form: https://register.edgeryders.eu/**\n\n### How is this event being organised?\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls.

Later different unMonasterians had different opinions about those challenges and what we might want to do or not to do with them.\n\nPersonally I see a major failure in accepting <strong>orphaned challenges</strong>. I mean by that - challenges which no one from local community <strong>committed</strong> to work on with us, I would say at least for one full day each week.

With swathes of employees asked to work from home, large tech companies like Amazon have benefited from an uptick in online retail. The company reported a [$33 billion ](https://observer.com/2020/04/amazon-q1-earning-coronavirus-impact-jeff-bezos-net-worth/)increase in profits.\n\nWhile the rich get richer, our community has been discussing the imbalances that Covid 19 has brought to society.

I followed the link &ndash; fascinating article quoting Pirenne as calling fraternity \"the most democratic system that ever existed in the Netherlands\". \n\nAnd I can well imagine how Edgeryders core team feel like a \"Fraternitas\". What interests me is what you, @nadia, see as the distinction (whether or not it is in Pirenne or in David de Ugarte who quotes Pirenne) between a Fraternitas and a democracy/community. It makes complete sense that when people have been working, and even living together for months or years, they develop the kind of knowledge, understanding (and as you indeed mention) trust and respect and sensitivity that is the basis for this \"Fraternitas\". For the record, I'm not a great fan of \"democracy\" understood in current terms. For several years, and in several different contexts, I have enjoyed the kind of governance motivated by consensus, but not constrained or held back by technicalities of theoretical \"consensus\".\n\nWhat exercised me at the Festival, and what continues to engage me as a real challenge, are the ways in which we can start off down the path of developing trust, towards, if we choose, enlarging the Fraternitas.

A mix of introductions, short talks and breakout sessions will enable us to 'dive deep' into each other's work and look at challenges from new angles, as well as explore new ways of working together to drive innovation in the near future.     \n\n**Everyone is a contributor.** All of those attending are asked to prepare in advance by reading about the others and their work. On site, everyone engages in constructive conversation by listening, asking questions, and offering advice and network connections to others.\n\n**Generative process:** We will be departing from key contributors' critical challenges to create a 'Wild Ideas' space where those challenges are reflected back with new questions which focus on revealing hidden opportuntities. The final sessions in particular are designed to map out collaboration activities and new networks to involve in maritime hubs transformations, as put forward by the entire group of participants.\n\n**The outcome of the event is a shared understanding of new, alternative, inclusive approaches** to building environmentally sustainable ecosystems. \n\n **Shared documentation for network learning.** All sessions will be documented thoroughly in order to ensure that both the EIT Climate KIC partners and event contributors can benefit and build upon in the near future. Online documents for note-naking will be shared with all participants for real time capturing of insights.\n\n\n## For latest version check with @Ilaria. An open-ended program.

They propose to \"talk about open source solutions for the port systems. Also, we could go an extra stage ask the port stakeholders what are there biggest issues / challenges and how we could craft an incubator program to find solutions for them.\"\nAttending: @William_COACT \n\n[Blivande House](https://blivande-site.herokuapp.com/). A 1000 m2 house and center for participatory art, culture and organisations situated in the Stockholm harbour. It hosts a co-working space, a makers space, artists studios and residencies. It started out in 2018 as a partnership between the community and the local authorities, and its vision is to build a creative ecosystem and experimentation space i.e. building modular container art galleries and workspaces, or miniature Swedish pine forest in the top container of the tower, as well as other projecfts for urban gardening and greening.\nAttending: @hugi.\n \nMore to come, stay tuned!\n\n## Organisers\n\n**Edgeryders:** Facilitator.

I believe that information and inspiration are key tools to empower youth and to encourage them to be active citizens.

It is amazing when people tell me that my initiative inspires them, that they are becoming active, and most importantly engaged in social change.\n\nAs a person coming from a small town in the north-west of Tunisia I encountered many challenges while coming to the capital city for studying and I had to do extra efforts to be as qualified as the others. Simply all of this because of regional disparities and the absence of access to information in my town. I noticed the huge difference between the two places as well as the gap of skills between a young person in Tunis and another one living in a rural place. I become engaged and I active and I have been participating in national and international initiatives to boost my skills so I can make an impact and be a change maker. After being a mentee with TMC the program gave me motivation to achieve.

This only works when using SignRequest templates, though. Without a single dedicated tool for time tracking, there will always be some form filling, so the question becomes who has to do it.

Our life goes from chair to chair. This was certainly not always like this and it doesn't have to.\n \nLooking at the well-known chairs like a foreigner (or an alien) would do, serves to visualize and evidence the current neocolonial context in which we find ourselves. The image of a person sitting on a chair can be understood as a symbol of the domestication of the body and the imposition of a foreign culture.\n\nNot only are chairs dangerous to the human spinal cord, pelvic area and colon, but they\u2019ve always have had an important role in processes of acculturation and colonization of the imaginary.\n \nThe word \u2018Chair\u2019 and the word cathedral share etymology, via Greek: kata (down) hedra (seat). Cathedrals were the most authoritative form church could invent. So somewhere in every chair there\u2019s a cathedral, or a ceremonial throne.\n\nThe english word \u2018Squat\u00b4 means to crouch with one's knees bent and one's heels close to one's buttocks, but it also means to occupy, to settle in an uninhabited building or a piece of land. The way these two meanings are related to each other is our object of study.\n\nIn many ways, squatting is occupying uninhabited sites of ourselves. When you squat, your balls hang loose, your uterus descends freely. You start to acknowledge the smell of your own sex. When you become a regular squatter, you find a lot of new places to hang out, realize how unnecessary and harmful toilets are and experience a funny feeling each time urban furniture \u201ctells\u201d you where and how to seat.\n\nThrough a series of group exercises, we will intend to denaturalize the figure of the chair and reclaim the ancestral posture of the squatting to eat, defecate, study, give birth or recreate.\nYou can watch some of our activities in our YouTube Chanel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxg9BqyYEK0ixsz7HkOCmwg", "created_at": "2017-10-09 07:08:23.793086", "updated_at": "2018-05-09 16:09:58.890666", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 333, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 274.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37629, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 7255, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@tneh Welcome to the platform!

They were primarily a live band, and for those who \"got it\" they were the best band in the world, if you like rock music to be more like jazz in the sense that no two shows are exactly the same with a lot of jamming and free-form playing.  So fans went to the concerts way more than they bought the records.  The Dead allowed their fans to openly tape record the shows and share them afterwards.  This encouraged more people to go see them live. This process led eventually to the late 80s when the Dead sold more live show tickets than any other band.  This was right when the Internet was getting started and a lot of early Netheads were also Deadheads.  How do you think JP Barlow got so much early traction for his statements?

We could run into tax implications (taxes to be paid in money on barter value income, which is quite impossible to do). So how to organize the collaborations to route around such issues?\n\nIn my understanding so far, barter trade has to be accounted for like any other income, which creates two issues and one non-issue:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>The non-issue: income tax for the company.</strong>\u00a0Edgeryders as a company would spend all turnover from ticket sales on business expenses for realizing LOTE4, by buying corresponing services on Makerfox. So it's income tax neutral.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Issue: VAT on ticket sales.</strong>\u00a0Edgeryders is registered for VAT now, so we have to include the UK VAT rate into ticket sales, and forward it to the UK government in legal tender currency. VAT would be tax-neutral like income tax if we'd sell all tickets to companies, but we sell them to individuals ...</li>\n\n<li><strong>Issue: income tax for participants.</strong>\u00a0Participants providing a service to make LOTE4 happen are rewarded with a ticket, and both service and ticket have a price tag. So the service is taxable income, although participants usually have no company registered.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo what do we do to solve this mess? We have a long list of workarounds for tax stuff in Makerfox, but the cases here (trade between businesses and private individuals) are the most difficult. The only idea I have so far is framing it as internal collaboration to build the event. It would be equivalent to a ticket discount or free ticket when volunteering as helping hand at the event, which is done by many festivals, the CCC conference and such. Would financial authorities accept that, and do we need any steps to make sure they do?\n\nObviously I'm looking for the knowledge of @ArthurD here ;-)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-29 19:01:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:19.978707", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 356, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85748, "user_id": 6331, "topic_id": 14472, "post_number": 10, "raw": "while i feel for your pain. \nthe only lessons that comes from your ignorance, \nis to allow the ignorant their bliss. \n\nenjoy the self righteousness \nseems like you need to win this argument \nmore than i care to explain", "created_at": "2020-10-25 18:49:53.974550", "updated_at": "2020-10-25 18:50:13.512831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85746], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85975, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14480, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:1, topic:14480\"]\nMatthew is a recognized voice for leadership teams, public investors, and media.

Of course the statistical studies would be by economists and/or sociologists; the ethnography by anthropologists.

The best study of a population with respect to most questions is to do the statistical study to get overall information about the structure of the population, and then to dive in to the why and how it works using ethnographies. Neither gives as good a view as both together. It is not hard to suppose that an ethnography can expose that two correlated phenomena that at first seemed to have a flow of causation from A to B actually have causation that flows from B to A, or both are caused by C, or there is no \"cause\" as such because actually the phenomenon could not exist without the interaction of A and B.This is base-level obvious analysis, but it is almost always ignored by major researchers, and so a good deal of research is bunk as a result.\n\nSo YES!

I am no linguist, but AFAIK:\n\n* languages are mostly codified \"after the fact\", typically in conjunction with political events. Some geopolitical quake happens, suddenly you have, let's say, an Albanian state, which promptly summons a convention to release an Albanian grammar and dictionary 1.0. But the basis for that codified language was a pre-existing linguistic community made up of several dialects related to varying degrees. In that community, like BS says, frequency of use matters. Words used more frequently are more likely to end up in the codified version of the language. \n* In the digital society, an average person is exposed to many more instances of using the language, because we now have social media, and have occasional interactions with many, many people who are not necessarily physically and socially close to us. \n\nSo, if you model the adoption of language patterns as a diffusion process along a network, social media means adding to that network a lot of long-distance edges. This accelerates dramatically diffusion. Networks scholars speak of *percolation*, because the impact of adding long distance edges to a network that starts with none (\"lattice network\") is highly nonlinear. \n\nLet's now complicate the model, and assume that adoption of language patterns depends on exposure, but also on an exogenous \"authority\" that tells you what is right and what is not (Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Accademia della Crusca etc.). We can imagine an initial situation where exposure is limited and local, and the authority can keep it in check, preventing the adoption of the pattern. As you add long-distance edges (social media), adoption gains momentum, and overwhelms the authority's braking effect. \n\nWhy invoke Alexa at all? It seems you do not need it to explain the phenomenon you are looking at.

News is what got it into the current mess. What we need is journalism, in the sense of researching, explaining, categorizing, reminding, and so on.\n\nAlas, that is a lot of work, and the result is a lot of work to consume too - you have to read in-depth articles to fully grok a given topic, and given our increasingly complex world, things are only getting more complicated, not less.\n\nThe other side of the problem is _time_. We can only spend so much time per day consuming media. And while the global audience is pretty big, the \"media consumption per day\" is a finite resource. And journalism competes with music, games, movies, tv shows, books, theater, individual conversations & gossip, lack of time because people need to have three jobs, and so on.\n\nAnd as now basically everyone can crank out content (watch me doing it _right now, right here!_), the competition for attention is getting even fiercer! Book authors not only compete with all the other media for attention, but they also compete with fanfiction, hobby authors, the giant backlog of already published books available for free on Project Gutenberg, and so on...\n\nSo even if you create top-notch content, entertainment, education or information, you need to get it out to people to see it. And then, yes, make money from it in some way too. And on both of these fronts, the competition is _fierce_.\n\nRight now, the solution seems to be to make the content as tantalizing, attention-grabbing and as a result even controversial as possible, while at the same time attaching the ideal price tag of \"free\" to it.\n\nThe latter means that we finance through ads, and the former means that the content choices err on the side of flashy and/or controversial. And the ad-financing then reinforces the second choice, because more attention means more ad-money too!\n\nLong story short: **Ad-financing content is the worst!** Really, it's the original sin of the internet, and we should push it away as far as possible.", "created_at": "2019-05-29 09:10:07.240867", "updated_at": "2019-05-29 09:10:07.240867", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 78.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [52969], "is_reply_to": [52969], "is_liked_by": [5, 2915, 1856, 5191], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84058, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 14487, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:4, topic:14487\"]\nWas so sad when their first space was destroyed (was it Nazis that burned it down?

Because interoperable they have to be: in a DIY / low resource economy, resource differentiation is even higher than in the money-based consumer economy. For example, I often need used spare parts for specific power tools, computers etc. and even with large marketplaces of used stuff (such as eBay in Germany), it can take weeks to get the right part. If this would be split over several economic exchange modes and possibly hundreds of mutually incompatible complementarry currencies, this severely limits the usefulness of what we can do in the alternative economy ...\n\nYour thoughts on this are welcome :) I have no clear idea for a solution yet, just that maybe a barter transaction could be the least common denominator of several systems (for example, no debt or deposists involved, so no currency needed as a net result).\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-31 00:13:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:40.410264", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 246, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15515], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77931, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13474, "post_number": 14, "raw": "# Fellowship Alumni as of 1/06/2020:\n\n### Peter Bihr\nPeter Bihr explores how emerging technologies can have a positive social impact.

Is it any wonder that accelerators sometimes seek new, creative reasons for you to raise more early investment?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-26 17:24:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.299819", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 121, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35796, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6996, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Wait: we are talking here about the data ON DRUPAL.

The Problem is that ethnography is very far indeed from being a collaborative discipline. \n\nAs @alex_levene mentions, @amelia and I are now talking of something called an [open codebook](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-notebook-science-for-ethnographic-coding-open-codebooks/8869). This maps perfectly onto my idea of a \"coding wiki\", with the great advantage that ethnographers relate to it: they know what a codebook is. The paper codebook serves as a metaphor for my wiki idea, just as the paper address book we used to have pre-computers serves as a metaphor for the piece of software called \"address book\" or similar.\n\nThe difficulty with that stuff is the obviously non-open culture of the discipline: \n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:1, topic:8869\"]\nBut this codebook is usually kept private, often on pen and paper, and doesn\u2019t get published alongside the final product. Asking an anthropologist for her field notes or codebook, in usual disciplinary practice, would be strange. Further, as ethnography is usually a solo pursuit, the ethnographer only has to make the codebook make sense to herself.\n[/quote]\n\nI found exactly the same thing among archaeologists. They also have a problem of \"what exactly constitutes evidence\"; they also have developed their own private repositories of knowledge that precede the writing of a paper (\"field notes\", \"gray literature\", etc.).

The \"Learning on the Edge\" report also makes it surprisingly clear how an education system has this factory paradigm of \"producing\" human assets for the economy, rather than autonomous, critically thinking persons. I liked these provocative stances and would like them to be read by the Handbook's addressees\u00a0 ...\n\nSo instead of policy reforms, I expect the state-supported education system to wither away (for anything but elementary school) by just being plain unnecessary. It is, when even companies start to hire people not based on formal certificates but on their <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=reputation&amp;filter=all\">StackOverflow profile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openbadges.org/en-US/\">Mozilla OpenBadges</a>, own tests or whatever. Personally I am at a point where I won't go back to being \"schooled\" ever because of all the inefficiencies experienced there. (Example: Because my university education wasn't apt for time saving self-determined learning styles, I ended up creating <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/documents/cs-studies\">lots of pages</a> of open content docs to fix that for myself ... . And with the new \"schoolish\" BSc / MSc system here in Germany, even this kind of self-determined learning got impossible.)\n\nOn the other hand, the alternatives (esp. free and open ones) are not totally ready yet. But sufficient for everybody who is willig to navigate some chaos and collect the material like mosaic pieces. I did that for learning Spanish myself lately, and lo and behold, I found <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/free-and-open-spanish\">near verything I need for free</a> on the web in high quality form. (Only frequency based vocabulary file and a good grammar cheatsheet were missing, so I created these as open content).\n\nSorry for the little rant, folks. I also had to get rid of some steam. It built up during my interactions with the school and university system ... .

I agree with your approach to carefully unpicking the different factors that play out in making Keynes's prophecy incorrect. We could even go further, and break down the 1930-2020 period into sub-periods: maybe some of the objective betterments that you note (longer lifespans, larger homes etc.) were mostly in place in, say, 1975, and after that the prosperity engine stalled. Or maybe not. \n\n[quote=\"petussing, post:83, topic:8582\"]\nIn 1930 people worked an average of 69 hours a week; now the average work week in the US (including vacations) is about 33 hours.\n[/quote]\n\nIs this contractual hours or actual timekeeping?

Going vegan, or running, or giving up flying, or zero-waste grocery become easier when done as groups. After all, we are an eusocial species, and good collaboration is our superpower. \n\nIn economic terms, this *should* mean we must be potentially quite good at \"managing the commons\", as Ostrom says. This would allow us to build an economy centered on public and common goods, which would be way more efficient than one based on private goods. \n\nWe have an economic theory that matches poorly our biology: it would work much better if we were evolved from lone predator species, like hawks or sharks, instead of from pack scavengers.

The companies buying the ads see the Net as a targeting machine and they want more value for the money they spend.

For the same reason, public registration is not possible yet (Error message: \"We cannot detect if your account was created, \u2026\"). And even if it were, an admin user would have to approve the account. So instead, use the process with invitation links above. Invitation links have to be copied and pasted, since our test installation intentionally cannot send e-mails (to prevent accidents of spamming people \u2026).

It's going to be a very complex problem to solve. Its tentacles go so far into other domains that are even more fundamental to our society.\n\nWhen we\u00a0set out to solve a complex problem in our organisation, we\u00a0start with small actions that change the context a little. Small experiments that can fail, but the lessons of which can scale big. A great example in government is a challenge this month of my own city where they will distribute 1,300,000 euros among civilian projects that aim to have a positive impact on the city. Citizen vote will account for 70% in the decision where the money goes. I don't think popularity contests are the best way to do this either, but it's a beginning and will change the playing field.\n\nYet this is already at the interface with the public, at the policy level. Most\u00a0possible small experiments I can think of\u00a0would all very likely fail at another point: the government itself. The\u00a0processes, people, time perception, incentive structures, ... Seperately these things\u00a0are not huge problems, but together they form a problem where there are little starting points to start solving it. I'd say the most important problem for\u00a0the government to solve today, is the government itself, not the policies\u00a0it produces. So we need small actions in that aspect, eg. hiring a few recruiters that recognise the skills needed to implement change. And then you can sustainably keep producing\u00a0good policy, even parallel while changing the internals.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-29 22:10:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.990228", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29961], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23533, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1265, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Interesting thinking (but wrong campaign?)</b>\n\nVinay, it says a lot about you that you would bring up global governance issues in a mission of the \"Making a living\" campaign! I would see this truly biblical \"cry in the desert\" more on other campaigns: given the nature of climate, one about common resources springs to mind. The point is legitimate, and we might want to bring it back with some force later into Edgeryders.\n\nMe? I had in mind the individual scale; I still do. Allies are people (or non-human entities, such as institutions) that we can turn to for help as we angle for making a living with reasonable integrity. Maybe I am just petty; on the other hand, maybe not. One thing that I like to say in collective action debates - I would certainly use it if I were sitting in a conference and you were to deliver a speech like this:\n\n<strong>there is no \"we\"</strong>\n\nThat is to say, there is no entity called \"we\" that acts in a coherent way in pursuit of its goals. \"We did not do it for poverty\" implies that this guy \"we\" has agency, and chose not to do it. But of course \"we\" has no agency, it is an emergent property of several things lower-level entities (people and organizations) do in a tightly interrelated world.\n\nSo, to figure out why the world looks the way it does, it makes sense to start at the lower level. Who can help you, or me, or any of the other Edgeryders in our quests (plural) for making a liing with integrity?

Invitation\n2. Follow up #1\n3. Follow up #2\n4. Follow up #3\n4. Social Media status updates\n5. Summary post\n\n\n## 1. Invitation\nI'm one of Edgeryders co-founders and I couldn't tell you what Edgeryders is because it is constantly evolving.. Only offer a rough description of how we operate.\nWe find people are doing work we believe is important and whose values align with our own= try to do some good in the world + science is important + don't be a jerk/creep/gaslighter.  And to build dense-networks between/around them. Why/how: https://festival.edgeryders.eu/#mission\n\nIn practice this means we try to cut down the investment of time and effort needed for people to discover, understand and build on one another\u2019s work. This involved posting a personal introduction to oneself and ones work on an online platform. Then our community managers draw the attention of others who have complimentary interests, needs, skills and or access to people who might: and the other way around. People read one another's stories/intros and post questions and answers through comments. Our community managers and research team reads/processes the conversations that develop, to find common ground between people having many separate conversations happening in parallel. We also have hired staff to scouting relevant opportunities to support people\u2019s work. These includes proposing joint applications to specific research grants or building financially viable projects to support long term work on issues.\n\nTo make it easy we schedule a one-on-one call to do an in depth interview that is more in conversation form. Then transcribe and do a first edit into a skeleton post for the interviewee to edit till they are happy, and when they are ready they post it under their own name. It takes a bit of an upfront investment to really get going (i'd say 2.5 hrs including interview time, responding to comments with questions from other participants, and a bit of prep ahead of the workshop).\n\nWe have been doing this work since 2013. Over time we have grown into a community, stewarded by a group of nice, fairly bright people. At present the community of people who are connecting this way on and offline is around 5000 people in +80 countries. It is an open, self-selecting network of people and diverse in the true sense of the word - but people who participate tend to be bright, curious, friendly and committed to the common good.\n\n\n## Follow up #1\nHi, The draft version of your interview is up in our closed workspace.

I <em>hope</em> that the old system dies out, at least when its proponents will have died out and the Edgeryders generation will own all the policy maker positions because there's nobody else left.\n\nBut yes, even that might not work out, like it did not with the 68ish student movements, and much for the same reasons. Many of which you listed already, and one might add a mechanisms of individual behavior that could also affect this generation: widespread opportunism. Because of economic necessities, students and teachers conform to \"the system\" that they basically oppose. And the \"doing nothing\" policy of policy makers is just another form of opportunism: the easiest way to go for them personally.\n\nSo, unless you can show me \"the way\" how societies can evolve in this matter fast, the only solution I found is to ignore and replace the education system for me personally and in my personal area of influence.

Many people might agree with me when I say friends are important while growing up, which is absolutely true! By travelling all my life and changing contexts, schools, friends, it struck me once I was older, how important the role of the family was. Who needs more friends when your best friends are your parents and sister? So what usually people think is the most important factor, is not. These are values that once were part of our society and are now endangered.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I would say the most important ingredient I missed in my upbringing was the absence of reasoning.\n\n2. The most important element was definitely a consequence of the first one. The absence of reasoning made me absorb unconsciously all the different aspects of a culture.

I went to live in Milan for an year,\u00a0and when I\u00a0finished,\u00a0in 1998 i start to work for a public\u00a0social agency in the town where i live now (Mantova), as indipendent consultant.\n\nBut at the time\u00a0i lived in another city, near Parma the one where i did civil service, and there i was engaged as public administrator since 1995 when i was 23, till 2004.\n\nSummarizing about the experience of mine in working:\n\nWhen i was young i started to work during the summer (since i was 14, till 23) in some factories. At 23 i started my experience in public administration as assessor and counselor (i don't know if my english is right).\n\nAt 26 i started to work as indipendent consultant. Since 1998 i choosed \"monitoring and evaluation\" as the field in which i wanted to go deep. In 2003 at Nomisma (Bologna) where i worked in that period i met the two persons that became my \"workmate\" till now and we founded our little little company named Sinopsis Lab, a private agency (<a href=\"http://www.sinopsislab.it/\">www.sinopsislab.it</a>).\n\nI confirm that you understood\u00a0that the experience i named in my post, are the result of a long time of different working experience. This was what push me to approach Edgeryders. I think Edgeryders challenge\u00a0is the real challenge for the future, about new kind of working life, very very different from tha ones i've lived and the ones my parent generation lived.\n\nI think school is not the one experience that a young person must do, since 14 to 23/24, eve if the school in which he/she goes is the best, or one of the best. I think practice and theory make a better person if they cross each other.\n\nI will try what you reccomend.\n\nCiao.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-04 08:31:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.059155", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 438, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22637, "user_id": 131, "topic_id": 1135, "post_number": 10, "raw": "How do we manage? Good question! It's only a \"big\" European festival if you aggregate the number of activities across the cities. We had <a href=\"http://www.wedowhatwesee.org/a-tale-of-twelve-cities/\">250 activities</a> across 12 cities last year, but many of them are micro activities, while some are programmes that we celebrate during the festival. We start, then we try and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/uuE4Dz\">join up the dots </a>between the ideas that each city has come up with - in terms of types of activity\u00a0(like living libraries) or issues they have in common. From all these ideas, we come up with <a href=\"http://bit.ly/vrkUbr\">design principles</a>\u00a0and capture the essence of all the ideas\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/s7VojL\">keywords</a>\u00a0that represent their diversity &amp; messiness. We then bring these into the process of developing ideas in our cities so that they're infused of the discussions going on in other cities taking part. It also helps link people from different cities who're working on similar \"keywords\" together to develop connections between their activities or even organise / fundraise for joint projects - and that's really important, to make the collaboration / transnationality meaningful both to people helping organise, taking part and fund/resource!\u00a0Here's a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/sSlm43\">summary</a> of the methods we've used.Here's an example of where several cities have used the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/vt4577\">design principle</a> around how people can use all their senses to express they way they feel about public space. In this example, the resources were artists / designers within our network and lots of paper &amp; string...When we do organise activities that do cost significant resource, like our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/17OTxcr\">caravan of the commons</a>, the festival is only one stop on that project's journey (literally in this case), so you're not putting all your eggs in one event's basket.\n\nFor Edgeryders, you have \\#LOTE which seems to be\u00a0a well understood &amp; practiced concept across the community. People could then organise within or alongside \\#LOTE mini\u00a0pop-up activities, some which could be\u00a0really thought through and others which are just playful and really lightweight (we had someone rockup at our festival co-design meetup and she came up with this idea of plastering stickers that looked like <a href=\"http://bit.ly/uvQNVU\">smiles</a> across the market, the fact that no-one found all the smiles is less important than the fun she had creating the activity!)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-23 20:31:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.874589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 467, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22164], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81332, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 86, "raw": "Awesome news, @Wojt.

What is the purpose of this research?**\n\nPOPREBEL focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The community research is hosted on Edgeryders, an online community of 5000 people in more than 80 countries who share experiences. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. As a consequence of getting to know people from around the world, we connect one another to important information, new ideas and new opportunities.\n\nThe research analysis considers content collected through [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/), subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.. More info: [https://populism-europe.com/poprebel/](https://populism-europe.com/poprebel/)\n\n**2. Do I have to take part?**\n\nNo. You can ask questions about the study before deciding whether or not to participate. If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself and the data you have provided from the study at any time during the event, without giving a reason and without penalty, by advising the researchers of this decision. If after the interview/call you choose to withdraw, please contact noemi@edgeryders.eu.\n\n**3. What will happen if I take part in the research?**\n\nThe event takes place digitally. It consists of an open discussion, moderated by Edgeryders staff and partners, or workshops provided by community members.\n\nIf you take part in the event you will be able to listen and contribute to the discussion.\n\nThe call will be recorded for reference purposes for the POPREBEL research described above and the facilitator to improve similar webinars.\n\nEdgeryders staff will write a report of the call to be published in the platform to share all outcomes.\n\n**4. Are there any potential risks in taking part?**\n\nThe risks of participation are minimal and include for example involuntary data breach leading to sharing beyond the original intention. We are prepared and committed to prevent any of this. We are using a third party service as a facility for video conferencing. So, we are subject to the features and security issues that come with that software. In particular, be aware that they may record your IP, even if you connect with a pseudonym via a browser.\n\n**5. Are there any benefits in taking part?**\n\nThere are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study. As a result it may have indirect benefit to participants. As a benefit of participating in the event you will learn new skills and you will make new connections that you will be able to use for your own projects and benefits.\n\nThere will be no payment for taking part in this study. The events are free of charge.\n\n**6. How is the event documented?**\n\nWe record the call, transcribe the recording, and post parts of it on our forum. We only mention you by the Edgeryders username you have selected. If you prefer not to be mentioned by username, please let us know in advance of the call.\nThe chat will be saved temporarily, for the purposes of completing the writeups.\n\n**7. Will the research be published?**\n\nOne or more writeups will appear on the edgeryders.eu forum - [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing). Writeups will be attributed to their authors, not the participants. That is an open forum, so participants are welcome to use it to comment, respond, or contribute their own writeups.\n\nThe whole content of the https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing forum (including the mentioned writeup, and any discussion about them) will then become the basis for at least one research report. We also hope to publish one or more journal article.\n\n**8. Who is organising and funding the research?**\n\nThe research is organised by Edgeryders and funded by the European Union via a research project called [POPREBEL](https://populism-europe.com/poprebel/).\n\n**9. Who do I contact if I have a concern about the study or I wish to complain?**\n\nIf at any point you\u2019d like your contributions removed from the online forum, just ask one of the admins (@noemi) and they will happily take it down.\n\nYou can contact Noemi Salantiu, Community Manager at Edgeryders via a direct message [here](https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi) or ping @Noemi or via email at [noemi@edgeryders.eu](mailto:noemi@edgeryders.eu).", "created_at": "2020-08-31 11:03:31.123009", "updated_at": "2020-10-28 07:52:27.069565", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 735, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53728, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 58, "raw": "I think that does not have much to do with the financing model.

My name is Alberto, one of the old hands here at Edgeryders. Your space looks beautiful and inspiring!\n\nI have a question, and my apologies if it sounds a bit thorny. I have the impression that a lot of the innovation really worth doing tends to *destroy* GDP, not increase it, and in general to be bad for capitalism (not to put too fine a point on it). Environmental innovation is not the only type of innovation where I see this, but it is where this effect seems strongest. I write this under the influence of the [Deep Adaptation paper](/t/10726), where Bendell essentially says  that sustainability is over. We are now in the age of adaptation, and the three directions of work for adaptation are resilience, relinquishment and restoration. Relinquishment is particularly important: maybe the most impactful environmental innovation is going to come from *giving up* stuff (private cars, commercial aviation, most meat). \n\n*Not buying things* is infinitely scalable, but it generates economic benefit from public goods (like the natural environment) instead of market transactions. Public goods are famously difficult to monetize, which adds further efficiency because just letting people enjoy them is very cheap and (again) scalable, but, in my experience, they are not a direction that incubators, VCs etc. like to take. They like \"sustainable\", which is mostly business as usual.\n\nI am curious: how does this tension play out at COACT?

It's designed to help people find solutions at every level of society. We have already planned to adapt it to our lab's project to organise the life in every aspect. It could be used for a family, a community, a farm, a village, a town, a school, or the world. It's just about avoiding speaking about important matters in front of each others, but to take the time to think about the problem, search for solutions, and discuss about it.\n\nTo be honest, it's hard to describe it because atm it's just words and a place for them.

I think that knowledge is power and that a lot of people just don't know what is happening because they don't look for the truth or don't know where and how to get it. There's a lot of websites that are doing a fantastic job to inform people, show them, alert them. I thought it could be cool to use these datas or informations to start discussions, to debate about finding solutions.\n\nThe website and the concept behind have evolved a lot since this first idea, but it's mainly about it. Changing the conditions of a debate to make it accessible and transparent, like actual politics are not. It turned out that while looking for a hostname, we tried, my bro' and myself during an hour to find a name no one took. Believe me, we tried loooad of things. D\u00e9mopolitique was available and it made sense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nD\u00e9mopolitique is not a solution. It's a tool that could help people find solutions collaboratively.

Now, you have these inner city shops that do the same, like Au Bout Du Champ (they have 4 frontshops in Paris..), and also start-ups like La Ruche Qui Dit Oui, wich is also distributing directly the bags of vegetables to their customers, but also launched a partnership with the SNCF (national unique train company in France) to make.every station a local food distribution spot...\nAnd now it's not even only just about the vegetables, since a former teacher of mine during my cheesemongery course, has now launched what he calls La Laiterie de Paris. It's a place where he both transforms and sells milks from local producers. It's absolutely unique and completely exploding right now under the press coverage following the business success.\n\nAnyway, thank you very much for the follow up story.

Some of these have dubious track records on the respect of human rights online. In the words of one participant:\n> In the last week, it\u2019s been reported that around a dozen governments are using Palantir software and that the company is in talks with several more. They include agencies in Austria, Canada, Greece and Spain, the US, and the UK.\n\n* The public is scared, so willing to accept almost anything.\n[/quote]\n\nLook for \"solutionist\" language (solution, effective, efficient, real-time, scalable etc.). See if it trends (but do we have a counterfactual?); see if it co-occurs with epidemics language (COVID, Coronavirus, pandemic) and tech solutions thereto (contact tracing app), especially linked to surveillance companies (Palantir, others?). See if the sentiment is positive. If none of these occur, the hypothesis is not supported.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:13183\"]\n## Result 2. Contact tracing apps are ineffective against COVID-19, but may help in the next pandemic\n[...] Among failure modes, people cited:\n\n* Data governance issues: possible breaches, difficulty to anonymize the data, and so on. More on this below.\n* Lock-in effects: for these app to work, they need 50-60% of the population to take them on. It\u2019s a \u201cwinner-take-it-all\u201d service. There is potential for companies to lock authorities into long term contracts, invoke all kinds of confidentiality to protect their business models, and so on. This situation could prevent better solutions from emerging.\n* Loss of confidence: if the authorities roll out an app, and it does not deliver, the public may lose confidence in *any* app. This could happen as new cases rise again after lockdown is loosened, as is happening currently across Asia. This might burn an opportunity to help contain the next pandemic at an early stage.\n[/quote]\n\nRepeat the game: identify a batch of words related to  anonymity (anonymize, breach, locational) and another linked to the possible issues identified by the Surveillance Pandemic focus group (takeup, adoption, lock-in, credibility, confidence), then look at occurrence, co-occurrence and sentiment. \n\nYou get the idea.

Allow open discussion about the subject (ANY SUBJECT), consider all FACTS and transparently make decisions.\n\nWe have neither transparency nor open  discussion, I never saw such censorship...not even in war times!\n\nThen I would make a decision based on the outcome of those discussions, had by relevant people obviously. The only thing I could do is listen to them and try logically to find the best solution. Relevant meaning people with knowledge and experience in the field...media sites Bill Gates, Fauci and some random highly paid monkeys but silences and ridicules professionals with decades of experience and incredible accomplishments in the field...that by itself is a travesty and should never be allowed in any country aspiring to be or calling itself democracy.\n\nBased on the info I have and the way I understand it:\n\nIt's hard to say as there is too much manipulation right now...and I can't understand their agenda.\nIn some cases it's clear, as there are big financial incentives for hospitals. If you combine that with the fact that A LOT LESS people go to hospitals, they are very much encouraged by the policy put in place to report as much COVID cases as they can. Autopsy is done on how many cases? 5% max? How do they know who died of COVID? Practitioners will tell you that great majority of time it is a best guess they are making...\nSame thing with PCR tests, they are incredibly inaccurate and cannot distinguish between different corona viruses...it cannot even distinguish between lime disease and covid 19. My aunt has to have a paper proving she has lime disease as it will show up positive every time.\nIncredibly, we see flu diagnoses down by a huge number but corona cases growing big time as soon as schools opened...and a very low number of those actually end up as severe cases (just like flu).\n\n1. **I would certainly not introduce any kind of lockdowns** but rather establish systems for helping those who most need it. Elderly and in general people from high risk groups.\nSo far policies have just made them more vulnerable, as they interrupted completely or modified the existing systems.\nConsidering the average age of those who died of COVID and the mortality rate of infected in general, I cannot justify paralyzing the world.\n\n2. I would also make sure to **educate people** about how to keep their **immune system at maximum**. Which means eating healthy, sleeping properly, physical activity, spending the time with people we love etc...\nI certainly wouldn't create an atmosphere of fear and paranoia we have.\n\n3. I would allow practitioners to share their experiences, not censor or silence them if they go against my decisions/narrative. That is what is done now, best example being America's Frontline Doctors, Dr. Didier Raoult, German, Dutch, French initiatives, Serbian doctors who also spoke about data manipulation...The Barrington Declaration...there are examples of that all over the world.\nThe amazing example of manipulation there is the hydroxychloroquine \"research\". I wrote about it previously, with link to Lancet's article with huge RETRACTED letters over it. All media wrote about the research originally, but the fact it did not pass peer review and was retracted after a week was quickly buried under a pile of rubbish.\n\nMy logic behind it would be what Sweden did, but combined with my first point...it seems they failed there big time. That way the stronger part of the population would get the virus, their immune systems fighting it each time, making it weaker as it spreads but making our immune systems stronger. \nThat way, after some time, even those with higher risk would have much greater chance of getting through it. \n\nRight now we are being served a story the only solution is a vaccine. That is a pile of shit, just like vaccine against flu is a pile of shit. Pardon my French but that's me saying it mildly...\nI have 0 trust towards people making billions out of that. I have 0 trust towards people who have already **misused hundreds of millions of public money** given to them for specific purpose of common good.\nBefore anyone starts with \"conspiracy theories\", that is **public information**, in shape of a recent **European Commission report** after their investigation into how big pharma used the grants they were given.\nThey basically used them for more profitable projects.\nI have also 0 trust in people known for their horrible business practices over decades, like Bill Gates. Suddenly the guys is the world's authority on health, public policy and the biggest philanthropist. \nI have 0 trust in the philanthropist who invested a lot into weapons manufacturers, GMO and vaccines...basically the most profitable industries and certainly not considering the common good.\nI also have 0 trust in companies which have little accountability and are **lobbying for even less accountability**. Vaccines are already exempt of tougher regulation regular medicine has to go through, but now they want absolute 0 accountability and a creation in EU of a fund like the US **National Vaccine**  Injury  **Compensation Program**.", "created_at": "2020-10-18 18:23:08.885341", "updated_at": "2020-10-18 18:23:08.885341", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 875, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 12.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85285], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61121, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10731, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Also: regarding the copy and images to send to me to get your visuals, here are the examples from the AI workshop so you can choose and image and copy accordingly :) :slight_smile:\n\n![Edgeryders-Fest-FB-1200x628-AI-other%20colour-01|690x361](upload://lzwcq5pNWbX1llVrLTdO1COq3jr.png)\n\nwould be great to have a \"talk/hacking/discussing\" in action image of you or something that represents your topic :)", "created_at": "2019-10-10 13:25:51.275803", "updated_at": "2019-10-10 13:27:26.736733", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 64, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 39.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5025, 1856, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61576, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 11168, "post_number": 1, "raw": "[ArtSakhFest]\n\nIn an abandoned theatre, in an internationally unrecognised territory Nagorno Karabakh, an art festival took place focused on rebuilding the cultural community, support the local economy, and contribute to world culture.

As you know all, Zmorda and I, with the supervision of Nadia and the support of the Edgeryders Team, have started working on implementing OCI Lab, the first P2P online incubator in the MENA region. The program which was co-designed collaboratively comes as continuity for the OPEN VILLAGE program. It has taken into account all the lessons learned during the its first phase that included the community calls, the festival, the reef house in Morocco and the Social innovation camps organized in OurGhema.\n\nWe have started OCI Lab in last May. We have adopted a strategy pretty similar to \u201cLean Startup Strategy\u201d, in order to make sure that what OCI Lab has to offer, answer the real needs of social entrepreneurs in the targeted countries. This will not only encourage them to adhere at a later stage but also it will effectively support them start and grow their social ventures and so achieve the desired outcomes.\n\nWe have started interviewing and discussing with young entrepreneurs since the month of June. Zmorda and I have participated in several events, like \u201cCloture du programme Safir Lab\u201d, \u201cForum Convergences\u201d, \u201cEnactus Tunisia national closing ceremony\u201d, \u201cStartupgateX\u201d etc. where we had the chance to chat with these young entrepreneurs, and briefly pitch the idea of OCI Lab to collect feedback and enhance our offer. Flexibility and accessibility, international exposure, belonging to a multinational community that can provide continuous support and the simplicity of the processes were quite attractive to these young entrepreneurs. They believe that these dimensions could bring them valuable support to develop their ventures locally, but with a perspective to go globally. The online community part was also an exciting idea, but they would need a little bit of assistance to navigate through it.   \n\nThese discussions helped us refine our offer and the processes of OCI Lab, and how it can support social entrepreneurs in the MENA region. They were very helpful also to develop our branding, our communication plans, and our outreach strategy. Accordingly, we have elaborated our first logo and branding, and the first version of the website went online in June.\n\nAfter our first info session organized on the 13th of August, (you can check it [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/1st-info-session-at-ourghema-space-follow-up/10568)), we have worked on refining further our branding and the design of our website, to end up with the final version of the logo more colorful which reflects the how enriching collective intelligence can be. We have also developed with Owen, much more attractive website that is available in three languages: (English, French, and Arabic).  \n\nThanks to these efforts, we have launched last Friday the call for applications, and a communication campaign to thrive more people to our Facebook page, and eventually to the platform. So far, the communication campaign is having really good results thanks to our cool branding, the strategy we have adopted in our social media communication, where we have started with animating the facebook page before going to sponsoring, and last to focus on the key added values of OCI Lab that would attract active social entrepreneurs in the targeted countries. So far, the number of fans jumped from 400likes to 2150likes in only 3 days with, 35k people reached in the 5 countries in the same period and over 515 clicks to our OCI Lab website. All of this proves that people are getting really curious about OCI Lab, and our project is getting interest from a lot of people, including potential partners who have started to follow our Facebook page.\n\nThat is being said, but there is still a lot of work to do. It is true that OCI Lab has started to gain notoriety in a very limited period, thanks to our effective communication campaign, and to reach our network in Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt where Zmorda and I have contacts. However, now our main challenge is to gain the trust of participants to start applying massively to OCI Lab. In order to achieve this, we are planning to organize:\n\n1. Outreach events  \n2. Info sessions in community spaces (coworking spaces, incubators, fablabs, universities etc.), \n3. Sending emails to almost 100 young people whom we have talked to during the Artificial Intelligence Hack and AfricUp events which happened lately in Tunisa, and who might be interested to apply, and finally \n4. we will go and meet potential partners starting next week, for sourcing project leaders and contributors, but also to explore how OCI Lab and Edgeryders can collaborate with them. We will start with Tunisia for now. \n\nTo conclude, I think we are on the right track, we have started to make noise around the project, now it is time to build a network of partners, and work on driving more young social entrepreneurs and contributors to apply by showing them the team and the organization behind it, and how this might be one of the most exciting experiences can ever have in their journeys :)", "created_at": "2019-09-26 09:51:59.408306", "updated_at": "2019-11-13 13:01:51.678993", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 853, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 263.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 2915, 3812], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3451, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3418, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">I will inquire about prices and discounts at B&amp;Bs, hostels and locals.</h3>\n\nAhead of Lote4 we are looking for cheap accommodation options to offer participants.

Or is it simply that until a couple of decades ago, during the Cold War, traditional politics were different? Young people will, on average, tend to be slightly more \"extreme\", so to speak; in my opinion until some 20 years ago, at least in western Europe which is the reality I know directly, traditional parties covered a wider political spectrum. One could be quite close to the extremes of the spectrum and still be represented, at least in part, by a political party. Only really, really extreme fringes were completely outside of the political organisations. Since the end of the Cold War, the political spectrum has immensely narrowed following (consciously or not) the American model, where both parties who contest the elections with a chance of winning them are slightly right of centre, one more so than the other. Thus more and more chunks of people - not only the young, I think - do not feel represented. Participation will be and very clearly is stronger when there is something concrete to fight for that can reasonably be achieved through the standard political means - just look at how participations in party politics is growing today in Scotland, where a drive towards a referendum for independence from the United Kingdom has started. Unless there is something \"big\" to work towards on a national basis, younger people usually get involved in politics on a local basis, often in order to reach a specific target, and once such target is reached several will drop out. Some will keep working in a party or a political organisation, others will end up running for office. It is a matter of wanting something. Also (and finally), probably because of the conversion towards the centre of party politics I mentioned above, politics are growing more and more \"serious\". A young person who comes from a family of little or no political culture, even though they don't encourage him/her to refuse politics out of principle, will hardly feel compelled to take up an interest. I guess it might be a cycle.

I\u2019ve recently developed customary electronic devices, using also Arduino board.\nAfter playing around with various accessories, I thought to give them a voice to ensure that they can be used without having to look at the display.\n\nMost Smart Devices have visual interaction systems, rich in menus and symbols. Interacting with them without the use of sight can be uncomfortable if not impossible. This is one of the reasons why, at times, I prefer to create devices developed ad hoc.\n\nWhen I started my research on electronic components that I could connect to Arduino, I noticed WTV020, and by reading the settings I realized that it would have been perfect for this project.\n\nAfter developing experimental electrical circuitry, I worked to give a shape to these objects, while my friends led me to WeMake Makerspace Fablab, the place of my dreams.\nAt the fablab I met wonderful people who expressed real interest in my projects and, since the very first day, provided me with necessary support, in order to finalize the product.\n\nAt the beginning of the Agile Planning activity we have structured the work defining the goals. Afterwards we have matched makers and tasks, according to their skills.\n\n**01_Why are we here**\n\n* Find a place where I could materialize my projects\n\n* Find people that could carry out those tasks that at the moment are impossible for me: such as producing items with laser cutter and 3D printers\n\n* Give visibility to my thoughts\n\n* Spread, confront and enhance my ideas\n\n* Market new solutions\n\n**02_Create an elevator pitch**\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/80f718895aace468fedd19b57f28190622a7a46b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n**THE** Voice Instruments project **IS AN** open source software / function **THAT** gives voice to electronic devices **FOR** blind people or, more generally, people unable to read **THAT** otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to readily use weather stations, thermostats, multimeters.\n\n**UNLIKE** products / solutions currently available on the market, **MY PRODUCT** is more versatile, cheaper and adaptable to different needs.\n\n**03_Create a NOT list**\n\n* Instruct and guide the designer in order to design the case until the lasercutting or 3D printing moment\n\n* Create the Bill of Materials (BOM)\n\n* Specify to PCB designer the necessary electrical components and their connections in order to produce and print the circuit\n\n* Write the library and guidelines related to the audio modules: WTV020 and MINI DF Player\n\n**04_Size it up**\n\n_Saturday, September 2_\n\n* (GIANNI) Formalize BOM and design PCB\n\n* (GIULIO) Update library for WTV020 module\n\n_Monday, September 4_\n\n* (GIULIO) Write library for MINI DF Player\n\n* (ANDREA) Design and produce the case\n\n_Tuesday, September 5_\n\n* (GIULIO) Write guidelines about the voice interface\u2019s use\n\n* (ANDREA) Design and produce the case\n\n* (CHIARA) Subscribe Maker membership\n\n_Wednesday, September 6_\n\n* (PAOLO) Create audio files for both modules\n\n_Thursday, September 7_\n\n* (GIULIO) Test library functionalities\n\n_Friday, September 8_\n\n* (COSTANTINO and ALESSIA) Carry out the interview\n\n* (COSTANTINO) Wrap up and next steps planning\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\nAt the end of this Maker in Residence we produced the first prototype of the speaking pH-meter, according to the requirements that we defined at the beginning of this journey. In addition we developed two complete guideline libraries to manage the enunciation of the numerical values and service messages, functioning with the most common audio modules, that can be used with the majority of sensors and devices available on the market.\n\nIn order to develop the first prototype of the speaking pH meter we analysed the test project and, subsequently, we conducted market researches in order to select the most suitable components to the final aim and finally, according to them, we designed the PCB.\n\nAfter defining the PCB specifications we designed a case that could contain the PCB itself and the components.\n\nThe current version of the case was realized in lasercut plywood. This material has been chosen mainly because of its cheap price and it\u2019s acoustic affinity.\n\nThe libraries have been conceived in order to read numeric values and service messages, and in order to function with two of the most common audio modules. The algorithm that has been used to read the values, however, could function with any other module.\n\nCurrently these numeric values are read by this interface in Italian language. Future developments of this project, however, involve using innovative components, adding support for foreign languages and, possibly, realizing a real speech synthesis system, based on a micro controller.", "created_at": "2017-10-09 13:43:52.213669", "updated_at": "2018-05-09 16:04:08.696425", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 744, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 127.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3002, 3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55020, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8582, "post_number": 77, "raw": "[quote=\"GrahamCaswell, post:67, topic:8582\"]\nMaybe it would only take a deep conversation at a critical cocktail party, and everything would change. After all, at a time when the thinking world is screaming out for a \u201cnew economic paradigm\u201d one is already emerging in front of our eyes, with existing cross-political and expert support, based on evidence, politically and institutionally realistic and possible, just waiting to be connected into a coherant and widely communicable whole. One consultation and discussion process, one week of focused and facilitated discussion, and one social platform incentivising focused action might have a chance. I mean, if Hayek managed to do it, it can be done again.\n\nBut right now there\u2019s more chance of getting funding for \u201craising awareness of climate through the medium of interpretative dance\u201d, or for walking to the North Pole to draw attention to the fate of polar bears, or for writing an obscure paper about how climate change threatens farmer\u2019s mental health - than there is of getting funding to develop and influence the core political-economics ideas and politics behind climate change itself (and the same goes for inequality, etc.). If there is ever a deep conversation at a critical cocktail party that changes everything, I\u2019ll bet that conversation will essentially be about one person convincing another person that an idea is important enough to let go of a little money. And that idea will be a real, defined political idea encompassing practical, specific, implementable policies.\n\nBecause anything else would just be more empty, vacuous, safe, vague, risk-averse, business-as-usual, normal, respectable, mediocre and ultimately suicidal horse manure.

We are planning to have 3-4 storytellers.This part lasts for about 2h. After introduction we all have lunch and spend time together.\n\n2. Open discussion about human interaction and collaboration. Hopefully others would also like to talk about their stories and things they find important.\n\nSince the main topics are about human interaction and collaboration that's exactly what we are focusing upon the whole event. The goal here is for the people to get to know each other and to make some good contacts. For those who like to do things on their own and not to wait for the institutions to do that for them. Introduce the EdgeRyders community to them to consider that platform as a valid place where they can contact with those of same thinking, to ease that connecting.\n\n# Cesto postavljena pitanja:\n\n### Kako da dobijem pozivnicu/kartu za ovu radionicu?\n\nOvaj doga\u0111aj okuplja ljude koji su trenutno izravno uklju\u010deni u izgradnju, istra\u017eivanje, regulaciju, unov\u010davanje i pru\u017eanje smislenog doprinosa \u0161irokoj raspravi o tehnologijama o kojima je rije\u010d. \u017delimo osigurati da svaki sudionik napusti mjesto predstavljanja i rasprave o svom radu s drugima koji im mogu pru\u017eiti smislen doprinos ili ih povezati s mogu\u0107nostima za daljnji profesionalni i osobni razvoj.

It's quite an effort to trawl through all the stuff to find the hidden gems, but surely less effort than other research methods (that require in-person travelling, for example).\n\nSo \u2026 did you try an in-depth web research in your areas of research, and if so, what were the results? I did not try it myself for your use cases, but to illustrate: for the case of Matteo\n\n[quote=\"matteo_uguzzoni, post:1, topic:8075\"]studying and researching the street games and the game\u2019s practices within the refugee populations in Europe and the Middle East[/quote]\n\nI would consider the following sources of materials, among others:\n\n* Facebook groups by refugees\n* Facebook feed of refugees (via Facebook graph search done by refugees you know and who trust you; they will typically have access to the feeds of hundreds of others)\n* documentaries, by professionals and amateurs, that include refugees playing something (and if only  in the background)\n* forums for social workers who work with refugees, in the various countries in Europe (reading there and asking them directly about what they know about refugees' games)\n* ethnographic research articles about street games in the countries of origin, also in the respective native languages\n\nI know this sounds contrary to what we as \"Edgeryders The Company\" actually sell. But I'd rather see it as a first step: results obtained this way are the \"low hanging fruits\", while research methods that involve building an online community need more effort and you would only want to invest that when you are sure that the knowledge you are looking for is definitely not available online \u2026 as then, there is simply no way around to motivating people to put their knowledge online.

Whether it is local administrations, investors, media, whatever.\n\nWhat \u00a0I mean by\u00a0theory is thinking tools that enable us and others\u00a0to develop values and norms that are also part of the work of developing alternatives.

A top brand, or a very early mover, could gain marketing advantages by putting in place serious cleanup\u00a0efforts. But for most small manufacturers in my native Emilia, these were just costs. The benefits went, by definition, to the\u00a0whole planet.\u00a0\n\nHowever, here's what happened over the decades: businesses started to realise they had done (albeit kicking and screaming)\u00a0the decent thing. The region had become more livable. As a territory (and not so much as single\u00a0businesses) they had indeed gathered some competitiveness.\u00a0\n\nIn your case, I think, \"it's an opportunity\" is a little more true. Your barber salon\u00a0or gorcery store\u00a0has a\u00a0ramp. The parent with the stroller, the person in the wheelchair can get in easily. They get a good experience. They are more likely to come back to you. But even here, I suspect that the \"area\" approach is going to be stronger: the message that registers is not \"you, personally,\u00a0can gain a business advantage by servicing people with reduced mobility\", but \"here in Milano we make everyone feel welcome\".

(Look at the spate of the disposals and failures in the sector.)

(Remember the market is competitive and low return, and council-funded clients will barely cover your minimum staffing and food costs.) Perhaps voluntarily attending such an entity would work?\n\nYes - to the idea of intergenerational interaction and care, yes to more community involvement and interaction for residents; but also yes to actually researching the practicalities involved...\n\nHave seen good examples of \"care villages\" elsewhere, especially designed to deal with dementia and Alzheimer's cases - shops but no money needed, good levels of interaction, residents free to roam and be independent with staff around to monitor and care but not impose... Such things sound excellent, as do the existing experiments elsewhere with intergenerational care (e.g. students living in care premises and assisting, in return for free accomodation).

This is really interesting.\n\nThe way I understand it, managing real estate in an overheated real estate market like the UK's\u00a0makes more money than producing care services. Hence the tension of these hedge funds that, as a result of being bottom-line oriented, focus on the buildings and not on the people.\u00a0\n\nThe separation of assets from activities makes a ton of sense. I looked up community land trusts on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_land_trust), and I think I now understand how that might work. It seems to me there is an \"upstream\" problem: finding the money to take a valuable piece of real estate off the market forever, damn the capital gain. I don't see how this can be completely solved. The advantage of the CLT model is that you only have to do that ONCE. Once you have done it, the land is secure (except if the CLT goes bust, but I imagine CLTs are supposed to be very risk-averse). Am I getting this right?\n\nCLTs might be of interest to @Nadia in view of The Reef.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-20 06:02:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:37.693188", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 208, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15711], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37965, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 7170, "post_number": 62, "raw": "Cooking team, I invite you to move all related discussion to this thread\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/openvillage-chefs/7382", "created_at": "2017-10-09 16:31:08.900620", "updated_at": "2017-10-09 16:31:08.900620", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 37.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [37926], "is_reply_to": [37964], "is_liked_by": [3769, 3818], "is_private": false}]
