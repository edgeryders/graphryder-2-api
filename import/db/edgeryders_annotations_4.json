We are @IreneLanza, @markomanka and Henrik Kjeldesen and it\u2019s our pleasure and pride to present SoundSight Training, an educational tool, as the name suggests, to develop and hone the innate ability of humanking to explore one\u2019 surroundings beyond the use of sight.\nIn boring technical details, it is an acoustic virtual reality that simulates in real time the diffusion, reflection and distortion of user emitted sounds in different environments, offering small variations to capture the consequent modulation of sound features in a trial and error learning process, mediated by appropriate feedback about the results.\nOur mission is to make this tool as accessible as possible, and open source, to be owned and tinkered around by its community, and for this reason we are slowly and organically onboarding hackers, and blind people alike, like our friends, Cecilia, Luca and Matteo.\nTrue to this vision, we have turned to crowdfunding as the fundraising strategy of choice, and we are trying to exploit the kickstarter campaign and press attention to mobilitate people, and to experience holding a stake into the success of this adventure.\nWe aim at allowing millions of blind people to train their hearing, and to learn how to echolocate and navigate in living environments.\nSo, down to the important question: would you like to help us? https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/960729924/soundsight-training-allow-blind-people-to-see-with", "created_at": "2017-05-30 20:51:10", "updated_at": "2017-05-30 20:51:10", "tag_id": 104, "post_id": 5117, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5084}, {"id": 4884, "text": null, "quote": "\u201cI can never thank the Reggio Emilia blind people union enough for accepting me in their community and interacting with me so sincerely and proactively.

A collision of honest and upfront conversations about existential experiences and a research of numerous solutions that had yet to be exploited in a certain context, rethinking their business models.\nAt this point, SoundSight was a completely new initiative. A virtual gym to train echolocation, and while the idea of features and UX design accumulated quickly, the team pursued a proof-of-concept and something that others could think of as a minimum viable product.\nThe first prototype was a mess. To the users invited to a test, it must have seemed unbelievable how a software engineer could have thought that a piece of software reverberating in a fixed environment and artificial sound would have been enough to suggest how the platform would work. Not to mention, a command line interface, and a rather lengthy procedure to change the position within the simulated environment. But thanks to the outgoing and always positive outlook of Irene, they never thought of disinvesting: SoundSight was an experience for them.\nThe team worked hectically on Irene\u2019s feedbacks, and a really workable proof-of-concept finally became available around Spring 2015.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s leave it again to Irene\u2019s recollection:\nIrene: \u201cHello Mario[1], we are here again\u2026 this time I promise you will be impressed\u201d\nMario: \u201cHi Irene, it\u2019s a pleasure\u2026 and rest assured, last time I was already impressed, although maybe not as you hoped for\u2026 with my friends we have been laughing a lot about your engineer\u2019s idea of a prototype!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cOh no, Mario\u2026 don\u2019t abuse him, or who knows when we will find another person with the same talent and will to do something meaningful even with no immediate profit in sight! I am counting on you to keep certain things\u201d\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Irene, I have only told the story to one or two\u2026 hundreds of people\u2026 ahahah!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cDoh! \u2026ok Mario, then to pay you back, today\u2019s text will be extra tough!\u201d\nMario: \u201cI am ready for the challenge!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIrene sets up the simulation\n\u00a0\nIrene: \u201cOK Mario, it\u2019s ready. I would like to ask you to try the first round without me sharing with you any information\u2026 I want you to focus on your impressions only, tell me how it feels\u201d\nMario: \u201clet\u2019s start\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe simulation is run, Mario is moved to several places in a cathedral in this virtual world, and listens to the echoes of a tongue click\n\u00a0\nMario: \u201cIndeed there have been a lot of improvements, it is smooth now\u2026 last time it was a bit of an annoyance to have to wait for so long every time you wanted to move the position. However, listening to a prerecorded tongue click\u2026 are you sure these are simulations?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes Mario\u2026 we know it still requires a bit of imagination, but I assure you this is a real time simulation. Later during the tests, I will offer you the possibility to move the position arbitrarily, and you should notice it. It is definitely on our list of priorities to introduce real-time input of user generated tongue clicks\u2026 we are just not there yet\u2026 you are one of our very early testers, and I cannot thank you enough for that\u201d\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t, I enjoy this experience, and I really like the concept. Somehow contributing to its realization makes me proud. However, you need my honest opinions, and I think the ability to exploit the user\u2019s own tongue click will improve the experience terrifically. I have realized that you have made me move through wide and small environments\u2026 but I haven\u2019t been able to identify where I was.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s already quite good Mario! I have only given you one point for each environment, and you have already been able to tell something about them\u2026 you are the best! We will focus on learning curves and performances later again, can you tell me anything else about your general impressions at the moment?\u201d\nMario: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell you more from just this\u2026 maybe we can move to the next exercise?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes, here we go. Get ready, and now I will let you walk through the environment of today, and you will hear repeated clicks\u2026 try to guess what it would be\u201d\nJust a quick run of the new scenario on the simulator\nMario: \u201chmmm\u2026 the smoothness has improved a lot\u2026 but I really could not tell you what it is. It seems a large environment, I have been getting away from a wall and after getting closer to another?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cI had told you would not have an easy life, after those jokes about our engineer Mario! But you did quite well. It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d\nMario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2026the simulator runs again shortly\nMario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d\nMario: \u201cAhahah\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey run the training set\nMario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d\nMario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d\nMario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d\nThey run the tests\nIrene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d\nThis is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming anyone can learn this skill.\n1\u00a0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy.

The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.\nThe first time we visited I was surprised how \u201egood\u201c the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view).\u00a0\nThe ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt\u00a0to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling.\u00a0Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room\u00a0(familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).\nUsually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories.\u00a0\nFirstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.\nThe Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying \u201eK\u00fchlschrank\u201c. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored\u00a0there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official \u201emeals\u201c. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way!\u00a0\nAnother interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.\nAlso very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.\nBerivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.\nAnother very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.\nAlso they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.\nBut still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.\nThere was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore.\u00a0What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:07:31", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:07:31", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 681, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 648}, {"id": 8737, "text": null, "quote": "How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?\nThis is the design challenge we want to solve during the on-going term or lets just say face at the moment. It came up to us through some interviews we and friends conducted in the last weeks with refugees or other newcomers in Berlin. What are your thoughts on this?\nTo make it easier for everyone interested to follow I will try to sum up the thoughts we had and the experiences we made recently.\nStarting with the question \u201cHow can food help people on the move to feel at home wherever they are at the moment?\u201d amongst others we got to talk to a 24 year old guy from Syria and a girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nSome of the most remarkable insights we got are about food some are not. Two I want to share because they add to our design question.\nThe guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. Maybe this does not happen in big towns he says but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends, to chat, meet new people and have some good Korean food but it ended up being too expensive, there was even an entrance fee and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events.\nAfter those interviews we talked about the \u201cBerlin Thaipark\u201d, were mostly Thai women sell homemade southeast Asian dishes on their blankets more or less being tolerated by the bureaucracy; about a great project by the New York based designer Candy Chang called Street vendor guide where she visualizes the most commonly violated rules in this context for the vendors themselves; and asked ourselves: How can we enable migrants to integrate the interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their culture of origin into Berlins community life?\nLater on one of our fellow students told us the following:\nA group of Syrian refugees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they would always have in summertime back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. When being asked if they are doing similar activities here in summertime they deny. They think that it is forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and do not want to act against the law seen their uncertain status. Still they miss them.\nThat basically is how we ended up facing the design question already mentioned above: How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?\nSo far we, a group of 4 university students, call our little project A Taste of Home and would be more than happy about any comment", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:31:45", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:31:45", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 683, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 650}, {"id": 4908, "text": null, "quote": "Sharing this:the ibreastexam, low-cost point-of-care breast health test\u00a0for use by community workers in low resource settings.

This device is designed to address the rising incidence of breast cancer in developing countries where women have limited or no access to breast cancer screening services.\nThe test is painless and radiation free, and takes less than 5 minutes to complete. The device can be used by any doctor or health worker and the results are available at the point-of-care.ibreastexam\u00a0assesses differences in tissue elasticity between malignant and non-cancerous breast tissue, and its tactile sensor measures shear stiffness and tissue compression when applied to the skin.\nA clinical study\u00a0conducted in India reported that the test maintained high specificity and outperformed an expert clinician who conducted a conventional clinical breast examination. All malignant lesions were identified by the device, while the clinician failed to identify a non-palpable lesion.\nUE Lifesciences won the 2016 Hitlab world cup at the Hitlab Innovators Summit in New York for their ibreastexam\u00a0system.

The aim is to focus on reducing\u00a0the number of inpatients over fifty years of age with entering the hospital with preventable ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, dementia, and lung cancer.\u00a0\nThe hospital is based\u00a0in The Liberties in Dublin, which got its name in the 12th century due to its location just outside Dublin City's walls \u2013 lands united with the city, but still keeping their own jurisdiction (hence \"liberties\"). The area's history is still very relevant to the health of its residents.\nBeing outside the city walls, the Liberties became a hub for trade and craftsmen. The 19th century saw the Liberties become dominated by large brewing and distilling families, most notably Guinness who built the world's largest brewery there. With this industrial wealth, however, came dire poverty and slum living conditions. Today the Liberties\u00a0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\u00a0positive and negative -\u00a0pervades. Although having undergone much urban regeneration as well as gentrification,\u00a0the Liberties still embodies that juncture between being a centre for enterprise and commercial life as well as being home to large blocks of inner city social housing. Homelessness, drug use, and lower than average life expectancy are some of the problems facing\u00a0in the Liberties today.\u00a0\nOn researching in the area first-hand, it was observed that there was a distinct lack of male presence in local community centres, as well as a high number of men drinking alone in pubs. The Liberties Local Health project draws on this observation to engage those lone drinkers to become members of a local brewing club, where beer is brewed by locals, for locals.\nThe\u00a0project takes its inspiration from the highly successful Men\u2019s Sheds mental health initiative whose\u00a0motto is, \u201cmen don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\nHOW?\nThe\u00a0brewing club for men over fifty\u00a0in the locality \u2013 where they create a low percentage beer brewed by locals,\u00a0for locals \u2013\u00a0harnesses existing local\u00a0skill sets of the hundreds of Guinness factory retirees.\nThe brewing club, \"Sl\u00e1inte\", takes it name from the Irish word for \"cheers\", also meaning \"health\". The aim of the club is to\u00a0encourage\u00a0more responsible drinking through\u00a0appreciation of the brewing process\u00a0as well as forming a sense of pride and comradery among members. The project was commended by health industry professionals after its presentation at Dublin\u2019s Active Age Conference 2012.\nWith Ireland's craft beer market having hit\u00a0\u20ac59 million in 2016 (up form \u20ac40 million in 2015) and volumes of beer from Irish microbreweries having increased by 415% between 2011 and 2015, the brewing club \"Sl\u00e1inte\" has high viability potential to run itself as a social enterprise overseen by members, bringing with it a sense of pride, achievement, and overall better health.\nUSER JOURNEY", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:36:19", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:36:19", "tag_id": 118, "post_id": 841, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 808}, {"id": 4912, "text": null, "quote": "It's a grand idea and project. \u00a0Your writeup says it started in 2012. \u00a0How has it been going since then? \u00a0Has it got those men to talking with each other more? \u00a0I am sure it does, even if it is about the beermaking. \u00a0That by itself would show it as a success since those guys aren't so alone anymore..", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:37:09", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:37:09", "tag_id": 118, "post_id": 10198, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 808}, {"id": 4913, "text": null, "quote": "Meanwhile, of course, I have studiously avoided the implications of the B-word.

And is accessed by both Greeks and immigrants (especially children) who lack educational opportunities.\nIt was established in 2004 on the initiative of Antiracist Initiative of Thessaloniki and since 2009 it is housed in a historic area of the city center. Beyond the Antiracist Initiative, its 3 floors currently house approximately 20 movements, labor, migration and social collectives, assemblies and other initiatives, like theatrical and cultural groups.\nInitiatives of the Migrants Social Centre also include voluntary actions of practical solidarity groups such as \u201cOut of the Classroom\u201d that offers free courses in Greeks and immigrants (Greek and foreign language lessons, additional teaching to Junior High School and High School students). It also runs:\n\n\na Solidarity Kitchen that offers meal and companionship to hundreds of people every weekend.\n \n\nRoom39 that gathers and distributes relief items and food to refugees and homeless.\n \n\nA Legal Support Group for refugees and immigrants and many other temporary or permanent activities.\n \n\nOther collectivities that reside independently in the Migrants Social Centre are Indigenous People of Biafra, the Network for Unemployed and Precarious Workers, the Network for Political and Social Rights, Ethical, Technological & Idealistic Association the Theatrical and Tango Group of Immigrants\u2019 Place, and much more.\nWe are reaching out to citizens and other local organizations through a dedicated website and our Facebook page, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to people in need. Additionally, we keep cooperating with collectivities all over the city and not only with these that are housed in the Migrants Social Centre, like the local social solidarity clinic.\nIn the Solidarity Kitchen, people who currently offer their services come from those who initially asked to have access to lunch on weekends. Also, we would like to highlight the contribution of Room 39\u2019s members, who deliver meals to homeless people all over the city center on bikes. It is the only initiative in Thessaloniki that serves food directly to the public spots where homeless people live every night.\nIt is a completely self-organised place, depending exclusively on volunteers\u2019 work and all of us who participate in it. Financially, the Social Centre is solely supported by donations of the participating groups and the profits of the clubroom.\nToday, the Migrants Social Centre faces many financial challenges, putting at risk its continuity and operations.\nOur Refugee Hostel was for years the only hosting structure for immigrants in Thessaloniki, offering free accommodation to 70 adults and children. When the Public Electricity Company cut the power in the hostel due to high debt, we reconnected the supply to our name. The existing debt will stop all activities and solidarity action housed and supported by the Centre. This includes the solidarity courses for locals and immigrants, the kitchen, the collection and distribution of relief items. Therefore, we address solidarity collectives in Greece and abroad, asking for contributions to repay this debt.", "created_at": "2017-03-13 17:33:43", "updated_at": "2017-03-13 17:33:43", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 748, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 715}, {"id": 4932, "text": null, "quote": "The only way to truly build bridges between communities is to \u00a0have them work together, eat together, talk and exchange knowledge about each other.

Ever since we were diagnosed with cancer until the end of our treatment we both were more than convinced our body could fight this and we eventually would win the battle. We were always pretty fanatic with sports and always had a focus on eating healthy. We immediately started to look for information on how to keep our body in the best shape during the chemo and radiation attack. During the first appointments we had at the hospital with a nurse specialized in cancer treatment, we received a lot of information on the treatment itself and its possible side effects. However, there was no information added on (healthy) food, which products to eat best during treatment or information on the possibility to continue exercising.\nAt home our search started at the internet and we looked up questions like: Is it healthy to sport during treatment? What is the best food to eat? Should we be adding supplements to our daily meals? Who can help to keep my body in the best shape?\nThrough the dietician working at the general practitioners office Carry got a first list of products, which could affect the treatment and also some products to prevent loosing too much weight. We did not know if we had to expect a weight loss, because that is what we all think chemo does to your bodies. What we forget is that you get a lot of medicines to fight the treatment side effects, which have again their own side effects, such as potentially gaining weight (take for example prednisone, one tends to store a lot of body liquids that could cause weight increase).\nThe information from the GPs dietician was not sufficient, therefore we asked for the advice of a dietician at the hospital. During the first appointment we asked all kinds of different questions, but we were shocked by the answers. Before we were ill, we ate very healthy, fresh/fair products, now we got the advice of the hospital dietician to buy ready meals in case we would did not feel well enough to cook. Or in case you would lose weight to eat artificially manufactured nutrition containing ingredients to increase weight.\nCurrently there are all kinds of \u2018food fanatics\u2019 and \u2018health hypes\u2019. We are convinced that healthy food should not be a trend. We don\u2019t want to focus on trends or hypes; our focus lies at informing people about healthy food and \u201cback to basic\u201d. We want to reach the target group of cancer patients, to help them in finding good food to fight the battle of their life. As we experienced ourselves, medical specialists at the hospital don\u2019t have enough time to guide a patient in the best way and many dieticians follow the \u2018old\u2019 rules and are promoting the medical food of the pharmaceutics industry.\nWe want to start a foundation, which will have a wide network of researchers, specialized food coaches, sport coaches and doctors to gather information and advice, on how to compose healthy menu\u2019s for cancer patients and provide information on healthy ways of exercising during your illness. Not only in general, but also customized, for each individual. Our plan is to set up an overview listing healthy products to eat during your treatment, but also listing products, that are particularly unhealthy.\nNext to that we want build up a network to reach out to people who cannot cook or are not able to exercise (or just walk) on their own. Look around to your own environment. If you were aware that there is a single man/woman, who lives a couple of streets away, which is not able to cook because he/she is too ill, would you not cook (needless to say that this needs to be in line with the advice of the foundation) for that person? This is called community care.Focusing on the hospital food will be the second target (long-term). Once we start informing patients and start working with researchers, food coaches, sport coaches and doctors, we will eventually be able to slowly change the hospital food.\nFiguring out the healthiest ways to fight your battle by staying in direct contact with your target group is part of specialized care, which would be the future in health care. Not general, but focus on single patients with their own problems/questions and side effects.\nChallenge\n(Customized) advice serving cancer patients during treatment (chemo, radiation,\u2026) to ensure optimal nutrition and exercise.\n\nfocusing on natural instead of artificially produced ingredients\nemphasizing the importance of regular and moderately intensive exercise.\n\nChannels\nShort-term: online (info and community)\nLong-term: face to face (workshops on two main subjects)\nActivities:\n\ndevelop and maintain a blog/website/platform with menu proposals containing healthy ingredients, working together with food coaches and researchers on this. It will be an interactive platform, on which people can also share their own experiences etc.,\ncontact points in the Netherlands on sports coaches to contact for guidance,\nset up sports projects and readings about healthy food and sports for cancer patients,\ncreate communities for healthy cooking, places where people can buy healthy food in case there are not able to cook themselves when they are very ill, or don\u2019t have a partner.\n\nType of community involved\nCommunity consists of cancer patients (no age restrictions or type of cancer)\nSolution proposed; effect on users life?\nEnsure optimal knowledge sharing to enable patients to continue the health-minded lifestyle of before their illness.\n\u00a0\nHow is it open?\nIt is accessible to anybody online (could be perceived as restricting because the community is language specific and starting with the Netherlands!)\n\u00a0\nHow does it \u2018care\u2019?\nThis platform contributes to care by offering a space where patients can share their knowledge and learn from each other concerning the subjects \u201chealthy nutrition\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d.

We are inspired by:\n\nopen source communities, that harness collective intelligence to find new solutions to old problems;\nnetworked organisations, notably Buurtzorg, the community care provider in the Netherlands, that combine the benefits of being small with the benefits of being part of something large.\ntraditional community-based approaches to care-giving that are human-centred and sustainable.\n\nWe intend to will achieve this in particular by taking over existing care home businesses and creating, one-by-one, a network of homes modelling the type of care we want to see. \u00a0Once we have established a small number of our own homes, we will reach out to other like-minded operators to create a broader community of homes around the UK.\nA key operating principle will be to involve all \"stakeholders\".\u00a0 Buurtzorg (mentioned above) has an excellent model, illustrating the various levels of involvement, and whilst this is primarily looking at home care as opposed to care homes, it is a useful way of viewing the bigger picture.\nCare home residents come into care with social networks, habits, routines and pastimes, which are normally stripped away on entering care. As far as possible these should be maintained because these are part of the person's \"support system\". Involving the family and friends as well as the wider community will, whilst it may add to the complexity, lighten the burden of care and increase quality of life for all affected.\nLegal structure:\u00a0 Our intention is to separate out the capital assets from the business of caring. The precise legal structure remains to be worked out but may be similar to a so-called community land trust (see http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts) where one organisation (maybe a charity) owns the freehold of the land and a social enterprise runs the care home. \u00a0There would be some element of employee ownership, which has been shown in many businesses to encourage higher than average levels of productivity and profitability.\nGetting started:\u00a0 Our intent is to start by acquiring control of one care home.\u00a0 In order to keep capital needs as low as possible in the early stages, the intention is to lease premises on a long-term lease rather than buying a home. An opportunity has been identified near the south coast of England and conversations have started with the owners.\u00a0 This is an interesting opportunity, in particular because there is an chance to acquire the property and business for a low price.\u00a0 The home is currently subject to \"special measures\u201d, imposed by the Care Quality Commission.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 18:59:19", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 18:59:19", "tag_id": 144, "post_id": 758, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 725}, {"id": 5055, "text": null, "quote": "hello, I was reminded of this post as we are having a conversation on care homes which run on intergenerational care.

The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down. That insignificant gesture of kindness might have saved his life and of other people who might have reacted the same way to him or with fear. Or for just ignoring him.\nThis is a project that we would love to see in practice really soon and maybe in this activity that you are organizing we might meet the right people or find the proper way to do it.

There were three lads living there already - Kieron, Dave and Billy. Kieron was the leader. He had a drill. Billy was very pale and very thin - kind of morose somehow while at the same time desperately optimistic. He looked like he hadn't seen a vitamin in months. Dave on the other hand, was just mad. At this point, quite obviously, even certifiably, mad. Just a week or so before he had actually escaped from the psychiatric hospital over the road, bringing to mind a scene from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. And over the course of our time together, Dave told me a few stories about that place, that enlightened paragon of metal health provision which had held him body and soul for all of nine months. He told me how he preferred prison, because at least in prison you got a release date. He told me about the electric shock therapy, which left your mind totally scrambled for two or three days, then left you feeling more or less ok for two or three days but with no memory, after which they did it all over again. He told me about being chained to four big guys who were there to 'look after him', even when he went to the toilet. About how if he didn't go along with something that they wanted him to do, sooner or later he'd get held down and recieve a knock-out shot delivered to his buttock, which resulted in unconsciousness and a noticeable reduction in his ability to stand up for his rights. Essentially, he didn't have any rights. He was mad. They could do whatever they wanted to him. The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I'm not so sure I believe them. Dave's approach was to break out of the place and find himself a squat to live in with a couple of mates and several total strangers, one of whom had been recognised by Kieron from a free party, when they bumped into each other down at the job centre. Its amazing what gets hatched down at the job centre, and I'm not talking about anyone finding a job. But anyway, when we turned up at the squat, Dave was living on the sofa in the lounge in a haze of ashtray cigarettes and cheap cider, eyeing the curtains nervously and never far away from a large knife. You got the feeling he was pretty keen never to go back inside that place if there was anything he had to say about it. And he wasn't leaving the house, or even that room much at this time. Absconders from mental health institutions tend to be automatically served with arrest warrants by the local magistrates, and I don't suppose that was helping his mental health any either. Dave seemed to be doing pretty well as far as I could see, considering everything that he'd gone through so far in his life. He told me his Dad was always drunk and often violent. He said his mother had been killed, shot by a farmer standing in front of her dog trying to protect him while out for a walk. That was when he left home. He'd had a job as the look-out for a gang of thieves that robbed industrial units at the age of nine. A little later he'd gone to live with a family of Irish travellers who'd trained him to be a bareknuckle boxer, a discipline at which he was apparently quite talented. Some time after that he'd bought a house, back when they gave mortgages to people with no job, no credit rating and no intention whatsoever to make even a single repayment. That episode lasted a few months, during which time he acquired an addiction to crack and heroin, or 'brown n white' as it was known on the estate. That was when the mental health issues really kicked in. I could sometimes see the different personalities fighting for control inside Dave's head. So much suffering just couldn't be contained inside one self-image, so the ever resourceful ego just created a couple of others to help take the strain. I think it was fair to say that Dave was feeling the pressure. And of course, he couldn't go to get any medication, because he knew the Doctor would just arrange to have him arrested as soon as he arrived at his appointment. \n\u00a0\nOn the one hand, Kieron and Billy were quite happy to have Dave and his knives living on the sofa. After all, this was a squat, and you never know what might go down. Sometimes you have to defend a place, and while Kieron liked his drill, that was about the limit of his handiness. And if anything serious went off you'd most likely find Billy in a cupboard. So Dave had his uses. And anyway, they were mates. But in this condition, he wasn't exactly easy company. So naturally, Billy and Kieron started to pal up a little. They shared a floor in the house with a kitchen in it, they went outside from time to time. They liked to get stoned together, and have a laugh. But this was unsettling to Dave somehow. He'd been mates with Billy for years, since the time he bought the house. He had no family left, no real friends after all the alcoholism, the drugs, the crime, and the madness. Billy was about all he had. And now he was feeling him drifting away. It all came to a head one full moon. It 'd been building for a while. You could feel it all through the house, under the neon strip lights in the corridors. Tension. The more Dave got wound up, the more Kieron and Billy retreated into their little flat. Sometimes you could hear him shouting incoherently in the lounge on his own. It wasn't very reassuring. But on this particular night, we found him shouting slightly more coherently, and it wasn't at himself. It was directed at Kieron. Dave was pacing the lounge, muttering to himself, wild-eyed. Then suddenly, something snapped. He grabbed his largest knife from under the cushions of the sofa and stormed out in the direction of the stairs. Larissa, sharp as ever, phoned Kieron fast and told him to lock his door. She was just in time. \n\u00a0\n'Yer fuckin big gay bastard! Open t'door.' \n\u00a0\n'Fuck off Dave' said Kieron, with his foot set hard against the door to keep his demented friend from getting in. \n\u00a0\nIt wasn't looking good. Dave was stabbing the door repeatedly with his enormous blade, while Kieron, who fortunately for him liked to eat a hearty meal, was leaning against it with all his weight. \n\u00a0\n'Open t'door or I'll fookin kill yer both'\n\u00a0\nIf I open t'door, that's when you'll fookin kill us both, was more what it looked like. \n\u00a0\nThe rest of us were gathering downstairs in the lounge. We'd known these people a week, and this was the only place we had to live. We were not ecstatic about the situation. And besides, we were worried, as much for Dave as for Kieron and Billy. We really liked Dave. He was a lovely lad, underneath all the addictive behaviour, the paranoia and the threat of imminent violence. I'd had a good connection with him from the start. We both had Irish ancestry. We shared a dark sense of humour. Dave's kind of funny was to make unbelievably hot curries, knowing that Billy didn't like them, but that he had no money and that there was no other food in the house. And then to watch Billy eating them, as his face got redder and redder, and his expressions grew ever more absurd. That was like Dave's perfect joke. So anyway, I headed up the stairs, with Dom close behind. The stairwell was pulsating, neon, harsh light. Nowhere to hide. Kieron's door was closed now, with the giant knife stuck in it, wobbling, and Dave half-shouting half-sobbing, desperately scared of losing his friend, his mind, his freedom. I wondered about his family history, and how much comprehension he had of his own emotional reality. It can't have been easy for him. And I thought about my own safety. But however erratic he'd been acting, I didn't feel any kind of malicious intent would be directed towards me.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, Dave. Dave man, it's me.'\n\u00a0\nDave was in his own world, and it was breaking down.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, what's up man? Why don't you put the knife down?'\n\u00a0\nHe kicked the door a couple of times, just desperate now, more than dangerous. My heart broke for him.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, you're bleeding mate! Look. Let me see that hand.'\n\u00a0\nDave looked at his palm, which had been cut by the knife as he had rammed it repeatedly into the door. It wasn't serious, but it was badly enough to make a fair mess. The sight of his own blood seemed to bring him back to himself. All the fight had gone out of him now. You could see he was ready to be taken care of.\n\u00a0\n'You should get that seen to Dave. You want me to come with you mate, we'll go down to the A&E dept at the bottom of the road?'\n\u00a0\nHe let me lead him away, still staring at his bloody palm, and I placed my arm around his shoulders as Dom discretely removed the knife from the door and hid it out of sight. The crisis it seemed, was over. At least for now.

Anything you took from the session and would like to share with the community? Do add it below in a comment. \nDuring the summer, brave people at Edgeryders like\u00a0Lauren,\u00a0Hazem,\u00a0Bezdomny,\u00a0mariabyck, and others have collected many case studies of people and communities trying to steward assets for the common good. In this session,they reported on what they found and the people they met.\nLauren Lapidge:\u00a0I moved across Europe (mostly Southern: Italy, Turkey, Greece, the latter turning out to be the best) looking for people and groups doing stewardship projects. I tried to go through social networks of people we knew, but that did not go too well (except in Athens, where Jeff Andreoni's network worked really well).\u00a0However, I did talk to many people on the street and that way met unexpected stewards, like Constantinou (?), an Athens pensioner who noticed people were struggling finding even money for food. So he started spending all his pension on cooking equipment and ingredients, which he puts in his car and drives to the worst crisis-stricken neighbourhoods to do a sort of instant soup kitchen. It is only supported by donations. He has amazing social skills too, and enjoys a lot of respect. Athens was the most successful. \u00a0\nA lesson learned for the travel case study:\u00a0it should take more time in each city and better coordinate in advance; also, Lauren\u00a0feels it was difficult to navigate new spaces where she didn't speak the language.\u00a0\nRelevance for stewardship: Costantino a good steward because he saw a problem in the community (eg dumpster diving) and felt he needed to help - ended up spending his pension to feed people.\u00a0he saw a problem in the community tried to solve it.\u00a0The stewarding component is visible in that he provides for people, creating a sense of community.\u00a0is that human or stewarding? what is stewardship? it is not about defining stewardship.\nWhat are the take away points in Lauren's trip? Found out that there are only a few stewards but they are involved in many many projects. eg Jay Cousins. Ice Hubs: started as a fab lab but they decided it wasn't the best way to spend the money, so decided to get the community involved in skill exchange;\u00a0inter generational exchange (pensioneer hacker spaces).\u00a0\nStewards should be interchangeable, and documentation is a key part of that\u00a0 stewards that can move between different areas in working domain, like someone who can talk to government and talk to a small community projects, can speak the 2 different languages.\u00a0\nBen Vickers\nMentions an interesting project that sells votes on the web (\"bring capitalism and democracy together\")\u00a0http://www.vote-auction.net/ I hosted a couple of meetups around stewardship in London and Stockholm. What emerged is that\u00a0stewardship is not necessarily resilience. Allotments are seen as a way to discover the values of stewardship. Some people say that stewardship is not a discrete activity, but an overarching philosophy around everything they do. Some people say that they don't necessarily steward one thing, but rather lend a hand to maintaining ecologies.\u00a0\nJordan Lane in Sweden understands well system thinking and applies it to small-scale scenario. He is an urban planner working for the public service in Stockholm. He describes himself as a \"urban shepherd\" (see:\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/the-urban-shepherd-of-stockholm). This is quite literal: you can use sheep as zoning devices, moving them across the city for various purposes. For example, you can move your sheep to the city center when children go to school, so they slow down traffic and children learn about animal.\nThe chicken story was very meticulously planned to get people to interact with each other and depend more on each other. For example, hatch the chicken in somebody's bathtub, so that person has to shower in a neighbour's bathroom, and that creates a tie. He seems to work in an oblique way: not just go out, buy the chicken and build the hatch, but go by a much slower route, distributing the ownership of the process (and therefore stewardship itself) across different people.\u00a0\nKei Kreutler\u00a0\nOpenTech School using agile learning instead of having a teacher in front. Started in Berlin and now has five locations across the world, we know it from the unMonastery. They came up with a\u00a0hackership program. Pedagogically, they have a \"no keyboard rule\": the teacher can't touch the student's keyboard. All workshops are free and open to everyone, no matter their skills. Also have HackerShip program, a 3 month residency to work on people's projects - with mentors and volunteers.\u00a0The funding model is this: when people graduate from the hackership program they pledge to give 10% of their salary to the program for one year.\nJeff Andreoni\nThe Peliti project in Greece (learn more: https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/peliti-seed-bank) stewards legacy seeds from all over the world. Many species are uniquely available in Greece, and that is how they became aware of the issue, but now they are stewarding indigenous species from anywhere in the world. They will give seeds to whoever wants them, so that anybody can become a steward of even just one or two species.\nMaria\u00a0Byck enjoyed the process of meeting different people, a\u00a0lot of people have different perception thoughts about stewardship. Discovered it was interesting for people to think of them as stewards.\u00a0In UK: system of allotment - lands owned by the state and people can pay small amounts for small parts of the land. In\u00a0smaller towns - populations losing their lands in the coal mining during the 80s.\u00a0People began stewarding gardening practices.\nStewarding the Great Lake Commons: 5 provinces, 6 states in the US bordering Canada. Idea that came from the first nations, the native American indians \"we take care of the water because it takes care of us\",\u00a0important concept which is related to the idea of \"EXCHANGE\"\u00a0\nJonathan Ruffer: is a very rich fund manager in London who calls himself\u00a0 \"a heavy-duty Christian\" and \"an old fart\". He bought a castle from the Church of England and is now buying also a lot of land off the church;\u00a0sees himself as a steward, he feels he's called to do this work\u00a0\nAmber Film and Video collective in Glasgow: they've been collecting stories around the working class and have a huge archive. When the people are documented, for them it's a validation of their work and being part of a bigger narrative.\u00a0Documentation as exchange, important for an artist\nPipe Factory in Glasgow: a residency and community art center. Huge volunteering efforts and self care as a critical issue of stewardship - people put off their lives.\nDifferent from working in a public sector and taking care of assets.\nSelf care is an issue in\u00a0stewardship. Stewards have a constant tendency to overextend themselves and get burned out or disillusioned.\u00a0 In Scotland there is legislation around letting communities own property (and in fact they have a \"right to buy\" land that goes up for sale). A similar scheme is now up in England (but in England almost no one uses it). The Scottish scheme is much older.\nNadia\u00a0El-Imam\nOn stewardship as an idea of exchange, of doing it for others vs doing it for others or my recognition; In order for it to happen there needs to be a feeling of right to take something - involves a transgression of rules eg Pisolino Libero, inhabiting the public space which in turn protected the neighborhood from drug dealers, recognize something as a common (example managing water) growing awareness, its not a given if you walk pass an underutilized building that someone would neccessary take care of it (state or whatever); lake of trust in the system .\u00a0\nA common problem in stewardship is that, once you start stewarding something, everybody expects you to do a lot more, \"you give the community a finger, they take your arm\".\nGrowing awareness that things are not necesarily well run - that someone is fixing that.\nRobin Chase\nIntersection repair is a US example that \"forces\" neighbors to interact.\nHazem Adel\nIn Egypt communities have a high degree of self-organization, and stewardship happens quite naturally. In the Muslim world there is a tradition of religious charity, so money is quite easily found. However, one person tends to be critical: if she leaves the community, that project will fail until someone else steps in.\nYoung architects in Egypt lead community efforts (no state intervention at all) to reorganize even the physical shape of the city. In Al-Mutamidiya, Cairo, the community built 4 ramps to the ring-road while the Mubarak government went down (https://edgeryders.eu/en/constructing-a-ring-road-exit-by-the-people-egypt). It was initially illegal, but then the police decided to sanction and now the four (highly professionally built) ramps are legal, there is even a small police station built under one of them.\u00a0\nCaroline Paulick-Thiel\nPrinzessinnengarten is a community-run agricultural project in the middle of Berlin. Knowledge transfer seems to be the main problem there, to make more working structures rather than more projects. Documentation is key.\u00a0\nNunzio on the way the Sassi were stewarded back in the days\nI was born in the Sassi, and was evicted as a child in the 1960s. I care about traditional pharmacology in the Sassi. This way of healing is based on the social structure of the Sassi, whose basic unit is\u00a0vicinato. That is: several dwellings overlooking a very small square with a well and a tub for washing clothes for common use. Commonalities arise around the scarcity of water (three public fountains for 17000 inhabitants in the Sassi, as late as 1930!). The need to share water is the basis of vicinato; then, vicinato becomes a social cell, building in a very cohesive micro-society. Families in the same vicinato help each other economically, but also by caring for each other's health. That's how we get into traditional medicine. Things that were exchanged: tools; herbs spices (parsley, garlic); food (tomatoes); ingredients (yeast). As all communities, vicinato had to manage conflicts. Those were mediated by elders, generally quite successfully. People lived in relative harmony, helped by a very strong sense of belonging.\u00a0 Women were central in the vicinato. They were \"ageless\"; much the same wrinkles at 25 or 70. Their needs were met by the vicinato (gossiping, emotional support, knowledge sharing). They were of course mothers, and families were very big in the Sassi; my family, with five children, was seen as not that big\". Women would rule the home-cave, where the bedroom, the kitchen and the stable were.&nbsp Medicine was administered by an older, charismatic woman, the comare (co-mother). Illness was understood both religiously and magically: you are ill, it's either divine punishment or evil eye. So healing was done via a maciaro (sorcerer) as much as a doctor. A typical treatment would include \"segni\" (three signs of cross on the forehead, the heart and the belly-button); later, the maciaro would become detached from the religious, and just stir herbal concoctions.\u00a0\nFurther readings related to the Case Study Adventure are in this group.\nYou might also be interested to read Maria's reflections on the Case Study Adventure here.", "created_at": "2015-02-10 11:56:55", "updated_at": "2015-02-10 11:56:55", "tag_id": 192, "post_id": 4016, "creator_id": 1974, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3983}, {"id": 5196, "text": null, "quote": "3) we could try to make case studies adventures part of future endeavors, or even a continuous thread throughout Edgeryders, and try to find ways to make it worthwhile for the people who submit the cases (and the ones who take the time to share their experiences).", "created_at": "2015-02-19 14:23:17", "updated_at": "2015-02-19 14:23:17", "tag_id": 192, "post_id": 3969, "creator_id": 1974, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3936}, {"id": 5197, "text": null, "quote": "Offering this service to a social project rather than a person (what Airbnb does) offers some more interesting possibilities, especially in the way you set this up.

They forget, get bored, fall ill, leave.\u00a0\nSo the challenge is: how can unreliable people make a reliable organization?\nThis isn't a new problem. If you look at the big structures of society -- corporations, governments, markets, armies -- you'll find they are all shaped around the need to be reliable.\nThey do it in 2 basic ways:\n\nMake people more reliable (e.g. through discipline or incentives)\nMake people interchangeable\n\nTake an army, for example. Soldiers are trained into reliability (e.g. by following orders at all costs). Ranks and training are standardized, so that any individual can easily be replaced by another with the same skills and rank.\nOr look at a factory. Workers are disiplined into arriving on time and working for 8 hours. And they are given standard jobs -- if one worker doesn't get out of bed, someone else will take over and the assembly line will continue.\nNeither method works well for a group like Edgeryders. We (presumably?) don't want to treat each other as interchangeable parts. We (mostly?) want to choose our own lives, not subject ourselves to the discipline of the drill-sergeant.

I have a rich medical history and although I had a brief run in with acupuncture, I never really went for it. I'd still like try it out\u00a0when the opportunity presents itself.\nIt's an interesting remark on the authority of health practitioners @steelweaver and @Noemi . I think the reliance on\u00a0guidance by an expert\u00a0is in large part\u00a0the result of the patients\u00a0not being as familiar with acupuncture\u00a0as the expert. Yet patients\u00a0are there for a reason: at some level, they believe in\u00a0the positive potential of the treatment. This common\u00a0belief of both parties is the base for authority and\u00a0lends you, or the practitioner, as an expert the authority to give direction. Authority governs the interaction and when nobody (or nothing) assumes it, confusion arises. To be clear:\u00a0authority is different from power.\nI can complement this with my personal experience in the standard healthcare system in Belgium. For a little over 5 years I had a series of serious physical afflictions, which didn't ever seem to heal or resolve themselves and only got worse over the years. At the start I always\u00a0left the clinic with a smile, which\u00a0always disappeared in days, weeks or months as the situation deteriorated again. I experienced first hand that I was just\u00a0a number, and that treating symptoms is faster and\u00a0easier. Good thing for pharma companies, because endlessly treating symptoms sells more drugs.\u00a0Finding the real cause takes longer, is harder and is more expensive, at least in the short term.\nI got pretty skeptical about the system by going from doctor to doctor and spending more time in physiotherapy than with my friends or family. Gradually I lost belief in the system. It was\u00a0after I ultimately found the cause and cure (very simple ones at that) that whatever remained\u00a0of my belief vanished.\u00a0With that\u00a0gone, there was no more common belief between me and the doctor, so the authority vanished. My language can't hide\u00a0it: I found the\u00a0solution, not a doctor or a system.\u00a0For this specific\u00a0illness, I will not lend authority very easily anymore either.\u00a0I'm lucky, as I have a general idea of healthcare through my studies\u00a0and know my body well by now, but this is clearly problematic for the general population when you hear similar stories with unhappy endings.\nAlso interesting that (at least for me) a big part of the authority of the health practitioner is due to belief in the system, rather than a belief in the knowledge of the doctor (which I never really doubted).\u00a0I think that might be a western thing, linked to what\u00a0surfaced in the discussions with @alkasem23 about differences in care with Syria:\u00a0in the west we put our trust in and rely on systems rather than other people. In some\u00a0other cultures,\u00a0people probably put their belief mainly in a person, the doctor.\nEasier interactions through\u00a0the internet,\u00a0powerful search engines,\u00a0a lot of people sharing experience and stories online, easy access to second opinions (in my country anyway)... Though they don't\u00a0always provide\u00a0correct information, these factors also\u00a0lead people to challenge the authority in terms of knowledge\u00a0of the practitioner in the classical doctor's office. I\u00a0think both this challenging of knowledge and the failure of the system will inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in healthcare.\nImportantly, authority cannot simply disappear, the common belief has to shift to something else. Most stories of\u00a0experimentation with new methods in the stories here on Edgeryders\u00a0share some sort of\u00a0community aspect. This\u00a0illustrates a shift to lending authority to a\u00a0collective rather than a system or a person.

Was someone ill able or unable to access treatment from healthcare providers? How did they go by?\nSabina: It was the fall of 2009 when it all started for me: the dizziness, the fatigue, trouble breathing, walking, doing\u00a0 basically anything. In October, I just put it on my crazy life style: mother of two, finishing the PhD, teaching at the Music University.\n\u00a0In November it was clear something else was going on. So I went to a private lab- the thought of a state hospital was too scary- and had a blood work done. Except it did not work the usual way: the results could not be read due to a strange characteristic of the sample.\nI knew it was a bad sign, so I turned to my adoptive grandmother, dr. Mirjam Bercovici. She figured it out in minutes, wrote me a recommendation letter and sent me to a real hospital. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia \u2013 a very rare blood disease- was confirmed and three years of fighting it in Romania and Austria followed.\nHow did she know and how does this relate to the problems of cytostatics in Romania?\nFor many years, Mirjam, a hematologist, was the chief of the Pediatric Department in the oncologic ward of the biggest hospital in Romania: Fundeni. She was now long retired, but still having nightmares about kids who could not be saved. Because, you see, even though the treatment had clear indications about when and how to give the medicines, they were not always available. The doctors in her section did miracles. Curing cancer without the necessary drugs is indeed a miracle. The always missed some important dose, they could not offer the kids the standard treatment their colleagues in the West were used to. It was the communist era and everything was very difficult, even for the most important health care center in the country.\nSo when she sent me there, she knew that I would receive the best possible care, but she was also aware of the limitations of a poor system, as populated with amazing doctors as it was.\nDuring my time in Fundeni, I spent lots of time with people dealing with forms of blood cancer. I was \u201clucky\u201d: only had to buy once dexamethason\u00a0for myself, but they were not so lucky:\u00a0 either filling tones of papers to get the newest drugs (the usual line was: we are giving to you, but only with \u201dthe dossier\u201d), either they had to figure out how to obtain certain medication themselves.\nBut two bone morrow aspirations and numerous transfusions later, when my condition worsened, there were talks about a treatment\u00a0 reserved for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mabthera, or Rituximab. Rituximab was not approved in AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia in Romania at that time. It still isn\u2019t.\nWas anyone inside hospitals listening or fighting back?\nThe situation was rather strange. The drug was expensive, not approved for my AIHA, but\u00a0available in theory. My roommates\u00a0 with Lymphoma could get it based on the dossier (so not standard). But they were missing other drugs, cheaper cytostatics like Bleomicin, compensated 100% from the state! It was like in the times when Mirjam Bercovici was active, all over again. Like nothing had changed in 40 years. Frustration was working both sides, because treatments sessions were postponed, sick people and doctors being equally worried.\nAll I knew was that doctors advised patients to figure out how to get the drugs.

It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks\u2026\nI gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar Bonnefooi: 4 floors, 500m2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn\u2019t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23 000 m2 documented.\nSo there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a futurism session created by Fo.AM that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.\nIt\u2019s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. \u2018Huis\u2019 means \u2018home\u2019 in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: \u201c that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.\u201d\nOne big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis.

However, unfortunately, this is not the mindset of the many Irish citizens at the moment. Apart from a select few controversial issues, there seems to be a general sense of apathy towards taking active roles in addressing our societal problems and creating a better future for Ireland. As far as I can see, this is mainly due to a combination of:\n- distractions of modern life\n- inadequate political and sociological education, and a lack of cultivation of critical thought in our school system\n- a feeling of disenfranchisement due to a series of corrupt and/or incapable governments\n- lack of easy-to-use infrastructure for the public to communicate their opinions and desires to government and have those opinions and desires reflected in legislation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the distractions of modern life may live on, the group I work with \"Grassroots Ireland\" looks to tackle the other three issues.\nWe are a grassroots, community-led movement that aims to empower people to become active citizens through providing simplified education opportunities and resources on useful topics such as politics, sociology, law and economics, so that people can understand and begin to shape the systems that govern their lives.\nThis, along with the promotion of critical thought and positive mental and physical health, we believe, will naturally breed community development and social progress.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne project we are currently working on in this regard is direct/liquid democracy software that will act as a platform for debating, voting and also as a resource for relevant information and simplified summaries of existing and proposed legislation.\nThe plan is to spread the application nationwide in an open-source manner and generate enough interest and demand from the public that the government have no choice but to adopt it, or an improved form, voted on by the public.\nIn our society convenience is often considered to be king. If we make it as easier for people to educate themselves, develop well-informed opinions and give them a means of expressing those opinions, this will lead to increase in confidence, and a desire to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome other projects we are working on at the moment are:\n- A community hub that will act as a caf\u00e9 and safe physical space to build a community and active citizenry around, for educational talks, wellness classes of all kinds, meetings of community groups and just somewhere to encourage the discussion of important issues\n- A community garden and vegetable growing co-op.\n- A renewable energy co-op\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile it would be great if we could release the direct democracy software and everything would sort itself, we are not banking on it. We realise that people can be skeptical of any kind of change and also reluctant to accept any more responsibility than they already have.\nSo, as a grassroots organisation first and foremost, we hope to use the above social enterprises to provide working alternative models on the ground in our communities to show them that there are better and fairer ways of doing things.\nWe believe that through social enterprises like the ones above, which are scaleable and replicable, we can work with and change the systems that exist from within. \u201cHack the system\u201d, as they say.

That project outlined the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River. The river was buried under the city of Buffalo in the 1800\u2019s as a way to keep from dealing with the smell and pollution found in the water. Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.\u00a0 My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset. \nIt was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. I was excited about extending my body of work beyond the Western Hemisphere and to working with a culturally diverse community. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in me starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project\u2019s success. During Jason\u2019s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the Bagmati River Arts Project has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project\u2019s publications and the sales of my artwork. \nThe Bagmati River Arts Project\u00a0includes:\nA. an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.\nB. a book is being published (available in November 2016) that documents the importance of the Bagmati River, the cause for the pollution, climate change effects on the Kathmandu Valley and its groundwater, and plans to improve the condition of the river. The role of this publication, like the exhibition, is to use aesthetics as a way to make the scientific data accessible to a wider audience. Artists from the United States and Nepal will be included in the publication. The publication will be made available in Kathmandu at no cost to the residents to assure wide dissemination of its data to a diverse communities. It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on this website.\nC. a documentary video will document the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on this website.\nD. a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We are working with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design.\nAll elements of the project listed above will be finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition in November 20, 2016 when Jason and I plan to return to Kathmandu.\nAn exciting extension to this project is the plan to ship the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters back to the United States where it will tour around the country and, possibly, internationally. Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.\nFor more information please contact alberto@albertorey.com.", "created_at": "2017-01-06 19:37:38", "updated_at": "2017-01-06 19:37:38", "tag_id": 318, "post_id": 752, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 719}, {"id": 5485, "text": null, "quote": "And @albertorey , about your initiative: the arts may indeed prove to be a key to get collective organizing going for river protection and cleanup. Example in question: I'm following a community in Mumbai doing regular cleanups on a local beach. They pulled some 3000 metric tons of plastic garbage from the ocean, but obviously the city always provides more. So back in July, a friend from Mumbai was looking for ways to catch the garbage while it's carried in the river and before it reaches the shore, and together we found this barrier boom technology, produced locally in India by a company from Bangalore. So the tech part is solved in principle (and the barrrier can even be installed in a way that lets boats pass.) But we are at a loss how to organize people to get this thing purchased (or DIY made) installed. After reading about your approach, it seems to me that an arts and documentary project could be the missing social catalyst in a case like this.

As @Pavlos\u00a0said, since he was a kid he saw degradation all around - his little coastal hometown, in North-Eastern Greece, surrounded by olive orchards, was always the reference point of a good life in a good space. Seeing the country devastated by urban sprawl, beaches consumed by villas and bars, and people being happy about this, worried him since a long time. So, after receiving education in Scotland, Germany, and researching native tribes of China and Thailand, he didn't only come back to Greece to rethink its food culture. He also decided to work on the climate.\u00a0\nPavlos is involved with climatetracker.org, an international team of young writers and quite possibly the biggest environmental youth movement of people from all around the world. These are decentralized and nonhierarchical groups led by activists in the Carribean, Europe, Latin America. They cover events in UN or COPs but also do investigative journalism on a local scale. Their work unmasks lobbies and harmful practices and has been published in key media across the globe. They also organize webinars and campaigns and often encourage writers to concentrate on a certain issue in a given period of time.\u00a0\nAnd Pavlos has an idea. Greece can become a hotspot of international dialogue on sustainability and resilience. As the country struggles with, as Pavlos has beautifully put it, \"restoring the zombie economy\", it innovates and experiments along the way. The social innovation and solidarity, however highly spontaneous and uncoordinated, are the backbone for the change. What would be necessary now is to organize those in collaboration with the right minds from all over the world in order to use the whole potential of this change and build a national economy that is regenerative and sustainable?\u00a0\nEven though Greek politicians and intellectuals in many cases seem stuck decades ago and their resistance to change is huge, what's happening around proves its inescapable. Pavlos thinks the best for them would be to funnel the energy into protecting marginalized groups, including the refugees, to lower their costs of transition.\u00a0\nThe Greek crisis has a side that not many people talk about - how would paying back the debt affects its environment. Pavlos believes paying off the money lent from the international institutions would create a huge ecological debt in terms of lack of sustainable land use and waste management.\u00a0\nNow, as the demos has been neglected and their voice hijacked during the last referendum, it's time to accept, at least tolerate, widespread civil disobedience that will drive the movement. 62% that disagreed has been silent so far, but it will have to speak soon. Even more, what seems to be an alternative idea, is not alternative anymore there - it's the only way out. Greece is exploring the open data tools and sharing knowledge, prototyping new was of accountability, transparency, decision making. And here the health and care appear again. Pavlos has seen plenty of interesting and viable practices and conclusions forming from the bottom-up, grassroots practice in Greece. These are the ways in which delivering health care has changed, in which social organization has challenged the systemic shortcomings. From those experiments and pieces emerges a complex, wide image of more inclusive future. It is built on the exchange of ideas and practices in an open manner. It rethinks the way we deliver care in a more decentralized way, more concentrated on prevention. It reframes urban food systems by educating people on the impact of what they eat on their health. Contemporary lifestyle jeopardizes 50 years of development in the health sector - food related diseases, new viruses, climate change, they all have a huge, negative impact on the quality of our lives. Technology and science, accompanied by open data and sharing, can prevent disastrous effects of those phenomena.\u00a0\nFinally, I asked how would he explain his entrepreneurial path to those opposing the market? He said a couple of things I find hilarious and worth considering. First of all, that activism is for city people - while he wanted to go back to his olive groves and do the farm life. Secondly, there is a dire need of changing the way people do business - in a sustainable way, with respect to diversity, with a different concept of what's valuable. It's not the price of land and potential golf courses, not the cheap fast forest. Thirdly, doing things like bread plates is not a rocket science - but if successful it points towards effective and regenerative entrepreneurship. Therefore, an entrepreneur doing such kind of work realizes the visions of an activist - by actually convincing a chain of restaurants to deliver local, better coffee or beer, by cutting off the middlemen. It means millions of people affected in a positive way. It takes a solid ethical concept and guts to take risks, but it pays off in many ways. And it fills the unemployment gap, which wastes the potential of a whole generation now. Interacting with the system is the way for Pavlos. And I really like the fact he's not used to failing.\u00a0\nYou can read the first part of the article here:\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with", "created_at": "2017-04-17 21:47:36", "updated_at": "2017-04-17 21:47:36", "tag_id": 318, "post_id": 704, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 671}, {"id": 5488, "text": null, "quote": "In 2014, I, Alberto Rey, had a solo museum exhibition at the Burchfield Penney Art Center.

Recent reports have ranked Nepal as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to the high rate of urbanization, unchecked industrial development, severely low water supply, high pollution levels, increasingly frequent extreme floods and droughts, predictions of worsening conditions and lack of appropriate planning to mitigate or adapt to these conditions. Reports also list Nepal as an LDC (least developed country), which indicates its potential limitations to address these issues.

The river is the most sacred Hindu and Buddhist river in Nepal and its banks border the holiest Hindu temples and several UNESCO heritage sites. Yet, it is the most polluted river in Nepal. The Bagmati River is also a prime example of how adversely climate change can affect a community while, at the same time, highlighting the resiliency and commitment of the residents to continue the fight to mend their river. The importance of the river to the people of Nepal and residents of Kathmandu had resulted in inspiring city-wide community events that have tried to restore the sacred waters. While their efforts are admirable and have motivated government action, little has been done to mitigate climate change causes or to adapt communities to their present conditions or to future projections. The proposed book, documentary and related programming connects the science of water quality and climate change to effects of urban migration, social norms, economics, industrial development, and government policies. The book will also investigate how the river\u2019s condition has affected religious rituals and culture. The inclusion of interviews and artwork by professional artists whose work deals with the Bagmati River will provide a unique visual perspective on Kathmandu\u2019s cultural connection to the river. While the issues investigated are specific to Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley, the general causes of the pollution, degradation of the water and its connection to climate change is reflective of many rivers and communities throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through aesthetically-interesting and related imagery, maps, and graphs, we hope to provide a new perspective on the interconnectedness of science, economics, environmentalism, health issues and art as it relates to the complexities of clean accessible water and the related social issues.

It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on the project website (http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/project-publication-2/).\n  a documentary video documents the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on the project's website (http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/videos/bagmati/).\n  a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We have worked with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design. We will be collaborating with the students at SUNY Fredonia to finish the design of the brochure and poster.\n \n All elements of the project listed above were finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition on November 20, 2016 at the Siddhartha Gallery in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n An exciting extension to this project is to have the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters tour the United States and internationally. The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.", "created_at": "2017-05-17 19:18:33", "updated_at": "2017-05-17 19:18:33", "tag_id": 318, "post_id": 576, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 543}, {"id": 5489, "text": null, "quote": "The seemingly unstoppable drive for ever-increasing economic growth is doing irreparable damage to the planet, to flora and fauna, and to human wellbeing.

A country like Bangladesh, which is constantly facing threats of so many kinds of natural disaster, is being increasingly ignorant about its natural conservation. This country has only 17% of forests within. This by the way is getting narrower. Even the largest mangrove forest Sundarbans, which is an internationally recognized world heritage site, is also facing terrible manmade disasters and constant environmental pollutions. It has reached such a zenith, that the global-ecosystem is threatened with the loss of a majority of all species, by the end of this century. Everyone knows, but some chose to ignore it, some choose to remain silent about it. But I thought the simplest solution to address this problem is just plant more trees. It\u2019s a simple yet most productive solution to involve the youth, who first of all should be concerned about it; secondly should take initiatives to mitigate this problem. The idea to run an online campaign came to me due to the massive participation of youth in social media. My goals were very simple, engaging the youth to talk about the problem or at least make them realize how important it is to address the issue. Secondly, mobilize my community to take an initiative in real space so that they feel the necessity to do something about this particular problem.\nAlong with few friends, I started inviting people over facebook to join the event. All they had to do is plant 5 trees and nominate 5 other friends on facebook to replicate the same. This way it will work like a chain reaction and we will be able to see a huge number of trees getting planted in a short period of time. The campaign is still going on and more people are joining. I know it has not gone viral and the number is not that high. Because in reality if you want to mobilize your community for a good cause, you have to ensure some motivations for them. Social norms are something that people tend to follow. Online campaign is there to help create a buzz, to create an objective. Which means if someone can bring out the movement from online space to offline, it moves faster and better. This is exactly why I have planned to run this campaign both online and offline.\nPrimarily I even offered few things extra to carry on with the campaign. Since I am an online based entrepreneur and I have a client tale which is 3 years old, we kind of have a personal trust relationship with each \u00a0other. So I personally offered my clients, I'll plant trees on behalf of them for every sell worth $10.\nTo bring the campaign to reality, a part of that plan involves talking to the civil society and involving them. Therefore, we are in touch with mayor\u2019s office to propose an idea to tell the citizens, if they plants 5 trees, they'll get a discount on their TAX. The CEO\u2019s of top notch companies to take part in this initiative where we want them to initiate a tree plantation program as a part of their CSR activities. Encourage their employees to plant trees so that they can get a better record at the end of the year in the ACR. We've asked the Headmasters of local schools to run the campaign along with the students, whoever plants more trees and takes care of them properly, will get an excellence award & certificate from the school. Recently our PM received the award of CHAMPION of the Earth for her outstanding initiative on\u00a0increasing forests and going green. I am simply trying to follow her path to make a change. Because I believe, OXYGEN is the most needed thing on earth and one can not simply buy a healthy environment with money. It takes proper plan and interest to create a land full of trees and a lot of patient. I got inspired by watching BHUTAN be the very first", "created_at": "2017-05-29 21:50:00", "updated_at": "2017-05-29 21:50:00", "tag_id": 318, "post_id": 848, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 815}, {"id": 9311, "text": null, "quote": "#OPENandChange Workshop Berlin \n\u201cLiving, working and ageing healthily within society\u201d \nThe OPENandChange workshop in Berlin began with a round for participants to introduce themselves. This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.\nOne group tackled the question of \"How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?\" in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized \"bottom-up\" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included \u2013 the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.\nThis common \"bottom-up\" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question \"How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?\"\nThe prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: \"How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?\"\nAnother group addressed the question of: \"How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?\" In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with \"age suits\" \u2013 young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.\nIn a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.\nThe third working group focused on the question: \"How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?\" Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in \"their\" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of \"living appreciation\" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.\nBased on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dehumanization of health and social systems \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all \nThe concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All we need is there if we work together and share our resources\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A paradigm shift is needed: \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\" \u2013 Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working \"with people for people\" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions \nThis solution leads to the following intended:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). \nStrong arguments for the proposal are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured \nOur approaches, technologies and tactics are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global Knowledge Network \u2013 CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the \"central office\" \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\"\nWe believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.\nAs expected results \u2013 in the context of existing cases \u2013 we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.\nFurthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy; \u00a0work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.\nHowever, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.\nBut also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power \u00a0could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are \"too many cooks\" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.\nYet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:\nWe are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an \"open-source\" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.\nThis leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of \"fringe groups\" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.\nFor evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle. The new system or the new platform reaches more people and connects more participants than previous systems or platforms. There are spaces where encounters already take place. Spaces can be created where encounters are possible. Spaces that meet various needs lead to added value for all.\nInterestingly, it can be stated that all three working groups arrived at very similar approaches and ideas, problems and solutions during this intense, exciting and inspiring eight hour workshop: A change of perspective and a paradigm shift is required - instead of focusing on fighting disease, working towards the promotion of health!\nCaroline Paulick-Thiel & Jahn Harrison, nextlearning e.V.\nTranslation: Alexander Paulick-Thiel", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:20:21", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:20:21", "tag_id": 1283, "post_id": 542, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 509}, {"id": 5491, "text": null, "quote": "Hello\u00a0@IFFAT-E-FARIA, thank you for sharing this project.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.", "created_at": "2017-05-17 19:27:42", "updated_at": "2017-05-17 19:27:42", "tag_id": 325, "post_id": 830, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 5520, "text": null, "quote": "Asnada is an association born in 2010 inspired from the strong desire of investigating the role of the language in integration processes. Through our social and educational work, we try to answer a question: how can we live together taking care of our specific differences?\u00a0 Far from the identity concept, we make the most of our similarity, using the new language (Italian) as a common ground. We have opened a first school for refugees and asylum seekers and, some years later, a school for unaccompanied minors. We are now nine (eight women and a man) coming from different backgrounds (Journalism, Pedagogy, Classical Studies, Education, Psychology, Cultural mediation, Languages) and ages (from 25 to 55).\u00a0\nOur schools are the places where we try to build up familiar relationships and a sense of community, but also the place where we try to understand, together, the contradictions of the world we live in. The learning group has here an essential role because it\u2019s the context in which every single student find his place, support and the courage to express himself. The variety of writing and speaking levels we look for in the student group is meant to lead to a free and informal circulation of knowledge and language skills, creating a context where the directory of teaching is also transversal, not only vertical.\nThe language we teach is not only the language of the daily routine, but an intimate language which allows people to reshape and rename their past and present experience, together with their aspirations and future projects. In order to allow everybody to have the opportunity to express himself or herself, we don\u2019t only use the spoken and written language: theatre exercises, songs, handcraft workshops, games, silent books, pictures and images, silk-screen printing, short films are the means through which explore the new language and ourselves.\u00a0\nMontessori\u2019s instruments give an important support to the learning process, as they help reading and writing but also studying grammatical and syntactical structures. We both use original instruments (for example, sandpaper letters, movable alphabet, set analysis and grammar symbols) and readapted tools we calibrated on purpose for the whole group.\nDuring these years we\u2019ve been meeting more than six hundred people coming from all over the world. This exchange of unconscious knowledge constantly creating new ways of schooling and in these years made us organize specific projects based on students real needs or passions:\u00a0\n\nThe discover of the importance - especially for illiterate students - of learning at a slow rhythm, also thanks to practical activities, is the reason why, three years ago, we started to organize \u201cThe ground language\u201d (La lingua della terra), a class around the growing of a vegetable garden and the study of the organic agriculture principles.\u00a0\nThe comprehension of the role of the mother tongue in our life, as the skeleton of our soul, press us to find a way to support and promote all the mother tongues. So, we hold up a group of story-tellers named \u201cRoots and Branches\u201d (Radici e Rami) sharing traditional and fairy tales, poems and myths in the first languages and in Italian.\u00a0\nDue to the need to use as soon as possible the new language also in order to better understand the world where we are living, with its contradictions, injustices and opportunities, we started to explore the city not only as tourists but as researchers: recorder, camera and a set of questions are the equipment with which we walk through the city asking people we meet to share their ideas, their point of view and experience about an issue which is meaningful for all the group.\nThe importance to look at the students as men and women having resources, abilities and strength enhance equal relationships.\u00a0\n\nFrom 2016, Asnada collaborates with the groups Nuovo Armenia and Gina Films. The City of Milano has assigned to us a farmstead (Cascina) situated in the centre of Dergano, a neighbors in the north of the city, in order to build up a place where migration issues could be faced through a cultural production, developed with the foreign communities themselves.\u00a0\nOur goal is to reshape the collective perception of the migration issue with the direct experience of a possibile living together, in order to avoid the usual relationships based on charity or humanitarian help. The \u201cCascina\u201d will be the place where, besides our schools, will be held a multilingual cinema where foreign and Italian people will watch movies in original languages, but also a cafeteria (with controlled prices) and a coworking area. The collaboration of schools and cinema\u00a0wants\u00a0to start a process of thought consciousness by crossing these two situations: italians dealing with foreign languages, and foreign people dealing with Italian and other foreign languages.\nThe \u201cCascina\u201d will be also a place for permanent education in intercultural field, where we will set meeting, readings, conferences and workshops open to all citizen, with a particular regard to the foreign communities of the neighbors.", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:12:09", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:12:09", "tag_id": 325, "post_id": 828, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 795}, {"id": 5783, "text": null, "quote": "This means you can be a visualization of the world and literally watch humanity look for collective-intelligence built knowledge on medicine and care.

Est-ce que je n\u2019arr\u00eate pas tout pour faire mon truc dans mon coin, sans les autres, car la seule personne sur qui je peux conter c\u2019est moi ? Une logique peu constructive mais tellement facile qu\u2019elle nous \u00e9loigne du vrai probl\u00e8me : pourquoi n\u2019apprenons nous pas la culture de la collaboration \u00e0 partir du plus jeune \u00e2ge ?\nNous l\u2019entendons partout : nous sommes dans une p\u00e9riode transitionnelle, qu\u2019elle soit positive (\u00e9mergence d\u2019\u00e9conomie collaborative, renouveau des mod\u00e8les low-tech, cr\u00e9ation d\u2019outils num\u00e9riques de gestion d\u00e9centralis\u00e9e, \u2026) ou n\u00e9gative (\u00e9mergence d\u2019organisations extr\u00e9mistes, renouveau des partis populiste-fasciste, cr\u00e9ation de tactiques num\u00e9rique de propagande,\u2026) nous voyons que l\u2019importance de se retrouver sous un arbre de valeur est d\u2019une grande importance en ce moment. Les outils sont l\u00e9gions : Trello pour les fanas de post-it digital en mode collaboration, Slack comme forum organique et le saint graal de la collaboration d\u00e9centralis\u00e9s : Github. Tous ont une arm\u00e9e de fans, mais tous ont le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : si il n\u2019y a pas une base de valeurs collaboratives sur quoi travailler, ces outils restent un beau d\u00e9cor. C\u2019est comme donner des outils de permaculture \u00e0 un fermier industriel : si il ne voit pas que les valeurs partag\u00e9es sont un atout majeur, il restera avec ces m\u00e9thodes classiques.\nLa Culture de la collaboration\nComme n\u2019importe quelle autre id\u00e9e soci\u00e9tale, elle devient omnipr\u00e9sente quand elle est vue comme une partie de notre \u2018culture\u2019. Mais aucune id\u00e9e n\u2019a fait partie de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confectionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019autre. Un premier pas pour aller vers cette \u2018Culture de la collaboration\u2019 est de voir l\u2019information comme un bateau qui doit arriver \u00e0 bon port. Ca ne sert \u00e0 rien de tenir l\u2019information pour soi, partage la avec la bonne personne, passe les bonnes id\u00e9es comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait un plateau de charcuterie \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e raclette. Chaque personne prendra bien soin de choisir l\u2019info qui lui convient le plus.\nCar une information qui v\u00e9hicule librement aide \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le deuxi\u00e8me point : Ne perdez plus d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e0 r\u00e9inventer la roue mais essayer de contribuer avec des projets d\u00e9j\u00e0 existant. C\u2019est en ajoutant de nouvelles grilles de lectures, en rentrant dans un projet avec un autre angle ou d\u2019autres informations qu\u2019on apprend beaucoup. Rester dans son enclos n\u2019aide personne, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9flexe protectionniste se comprend : vous voulez contr\u00f4ler votre id\u00e9e contre un opportunisme qui pourrait se cacher derri\u00e8re chaque recoin. Mais si nous acceptions, comme c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 le cas dans les recherches universitaires, d\u2019avoir un syst\u00e8me de mentions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour la collaboration de projet, nous devrions avoir moins peur de cet opportunisme.\nRecr\u00e9er la membrane de confiance\nCar voil\u00e0, le grand probl\u00e8me qui se cache derri\u00e8re cette peur inn\u00e9cessaire de la protection d\u2019information: on \u00e0 perdu notre membrane de confiance entre humain. Tout dans notre entourage nous dit de se m\u00e9fier de l\u2019autre. Car comme disait ce bon vieux Sartre: L\u2019enfer c\u2019est les autres. Mais si nous relisons la th\u00e9orie du Darwinisme social nous voyons que c\u2019est notre aptitude \u00e0 collaborer qui \u00e0 fait que nous avons surv\u00e9cu aux animaux dix fois plus grand que nous, aux p\u00e9riodes glaciaire et aux famines.\nPour recr\u00e9er cette membrane de confiance nous ne devons pas croire dans \u2018les grand mouvements\u2019, car comme les grandes histoires, elles sont mortes avant d\u2019entrer dans la p\u00e9riode post Moderne. Soyons comme Enspiral, un r\u00e9seaux de petit groupes. Cr\u00e9ons des petits faits, pour r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 se faire confiance. On ne doit pas d\u00e9crocher la lune, mais simplement savoir aider son voisin. La petite pierre que j\u2019apporte \u00e0 cet \u00e9difice est de prendre le caf\u00e9 chaque matin avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, d\u2019\u00e9couter son histoire et de voir ou je peut faire du lien.\nL\u2019ego doit donner place \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e\nDans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine nous donnons encore et toujours trop de place \u00e0 l\u2019ego, qui l\u2019emporte souvent en discussion de l\u2019id\u00e9e. Mais voil\u00e0 si nous voulons vraiment cr\u00e9er une culture de la collaboration nous devons mettre en place des freins \u00e0 l\u2019ego. De pouvoir \u00eatre fier de l\u2019ajout qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une id\u00e9e. Ne plus voir la collaboration comme une simple \u00e9conomie du (mauvais) couple, ou chacun donne et qu\u2019on fait les comptes quand \u00e7a ne va pas, mais se focaliser sur l\u2019id\u00e9e et les valeurs v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es en commun.\nPour \u00e7a la collaboration doit se faire par les faits et non par les mots. Trop souvent la r\u00e9union pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la participation, mais c\u2019est en faisant qu\u2019on apprend plus de la personne, que chaque personne est mise \u00e0 nue. Une expression invent\u00e9e par Nicolas de OpenFab trouve ici parfait \u00e9cho: nous devons cr\u00e9er l\u2019atome de FAIRE.\nUn prochain pas pourrait \u00eatre de redonner dans notre \u00e9ducation collective une vraie place \u00e0 la collaboration. Pas de travail- en groupe forc\u00e9 qui mal organis\u00e9 nous prouve que l\u2019enfer c\u2019est vraiment les autres, mais une culture de la collaboration ancr\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nSi vous avez des ressources la-dessus je suis preneur.\nHoward Rheingold | Who Said Collaboration Wasn\u2019t Sustainable\nJason Louv |The Next Buddha Will Be a Collective\nDaniel Christian Wahl | Collaboration and empathy as evolutionary success stories\nEnspiral Stories | 5 Reasons to Build a Network of Small Groups, Rather than a Mass Movement of Individuals", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:44:01", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:56.587792", "tag_id": 5999, "post_id": 33747, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6596}, {"id": 5536, "text": null, "quote": "They also did things like ran communal bakeries instead of having individual ovens.

I also note that the Apache software community are very good at clarifying how decisions are made and what role different people take in decision-making. See here in particular. I think it would be really valuable for Edgeryders to do something similar.

They are breeding grounds for social innovations and new bottom-up-strategies. Often people take initiative when traditional or institutional forms of care and support decline or do not meet people\u2019s needs. Community gardens and urban agriculture- the field in which I am personally engaged- can serve as a good example. Without being part of planning, or political programs, these places are mostly created by local, self-organized initiatives. Based on local engagement and alternative forms of economy and often without public or financial support, community gardens contribute to the well-being, social inclusion, healthy and sustainable lifestyles, biodiversity, the physical- as well as the social climate. Not only they contribute to the physical health of their participants, but also to their sense of dignity and self-esteem.\nThere is also a downside to community engagement. While community organizations have to promote themselves with success stories to get recognition, political- and financial support, the negative aspects are often less visible. You hear a lot about precarious funding, internal or outside conflicts, political and economic pressure, multitasking, impossible workloads, competition between projects. At the same time, dealing with complex and often rigid political and social institutions, community activists have to become self-trained experts in finances, public relations, lobbying, community-organizing etc. But these fights are long and complex and the institutions and their procedures require a patience that easily outlive the time, the physical and mental resources individuals and grassroots initiatives are able to mobilize.\nOver time, this situation can result in what you might call an \u201eactivism-burnout\u201c. When this happens, physical, mental, and social damages are far too often just seen as a personal or biographical drama. These individual burn-outs are likely to be accompanied by a weakening or even a collapse of the organizations and initiatives that are often carried by the engagement of single individuals. The disintegration can lead to a situation where an organization loses knowledge, expertise, networks, and spirit.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, community care should also include structures to support the people that are directly invested in it. It should create securing and supporting networks. Instead of competing, it should allow people from different initiatives in different fields of engagement to share their knowledge of failure. There should be at once structures of collective learning and consultancy, which at the same time help the individuals to find spaces of trust and recreation. With the Neighborhood Academy, we started informal meetings with members of different groups and initiatives, not only to exchange experience and knowledge and to broaden networks and alliances, but also to deal with stress, conflict, fear, doubt, and failure on a more personal level. Even though this is just a tentative beginning, we experience a need for this kind of care and support structures, which was previously not expressed. Often issues related to the stressful conditions of organizations and community initiatives are externalized into the private and infuse personal relations . Therefore on a structural level, we see these caring structures also as a\u00a0form to win even when you lose.\nCommunity groups often focus on single questions, spaces, conflicts. They often react under economic and time pressure to immediate problems. They act within marginalized or weak political and economical communities. They deal with institutions and stakeholders with more time, much power, and resources whereas they rely on limited personal resources or precarious funding. Simultaneously there are a lot of joy, learning and personal empowerment involved as well as a sense of a meaningful life and community relations. However, the risk of failing is high, which can lead to frustration and disintegration.\nCommunity care structures can help to ease this stress not only in giving support but also in a form of what we call \u201ecollective learning\u201c. They can work as an archive for the knowledge, the experiences and know-how being created in grassroots and community initiatives. Thus, they allow activists to see themselves not only as part of a\u00a0singular local fight that you might win or lose\u00a0but as contributors to a collective living memory.", "created_at": "2017-02-28 01:19:22", "updated_at": "2017-02-28 01:19:22", "tag_id": 335, "post_id": 507, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 474}, {"id": 16569, "text": "", "quote": "I am not distanced from local politics at all, especially not the one in Balkans.", "created_at": "2019-09-18 10:45:44.543756", "updated_at": "2019-09-18 10:45:44.543756", "tag_id": 3919, "post_id": 58781, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 5784, "text": null, "quote": "What does it mean to \"hear other people's perception on this\", and \"expressly into the social/gender direction\"?\u00a0 For example: do you want to organize a \"special edition\" community call, taking some time and effort to evoke the \"right\" people?

It\u2019s about bringing these two aspects, also existing in collaborative economies, communities, in hacker groups and activists promoting open access to knowledge, data and technology to stubborn, hermetic ecosystems of higher education. \n\u00a0\nMy current project, a weblab named Puntozero (http://puntozero.github.io/), explores the ways in which teachers, professors, tutors and students -used to the traditional model of lecturing a class and equipping people with theoretical knowledge and in-field training- might integrate in a community of practice to innovate the way of learning. This year there are about 150 students involved. The brainstorming about proposals include more talking to the patients, who want to collaborate and surely want to see medicine more friendly, more efficient, more human. It is important to change the way we see health care - not as a prestigious, restricted profession for a selected group of professional, but as a practice that has been there for thousands of years, a huge amount of collective wisdom that pioneered and support what we call medicine and care right now. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s fascinating to play with the idea of a healthcare student classroom where, instead of feeding people with theories, teachers would create space where students meet makers of all sorts and discuss various technological innovations with them, and spend time with their patients, getting hands on experience in various cases. By encouraging sharing of data, more interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity and networking educational institutions could create a new breed of health professionals. Their work style would be more inclusive and horizontal, and they would be more interested in critical thinking and discussion, sharing and transparency. \n\u00a0\nAt the moment I\u2019m working with a couple of small innovations that could lead to improved communication between health professionals and patients. One of them is about involving three trainees in archiving and developing a set of health-related caremojis, accessible in a open, less formal exchange, a tool improving communication and adoption of symbols to represent concepts of concern (e.g.: surgery tools, health conditions, symptoms, etc..). They will be soon ready to be used and evaluated by the students. \n\u00a0\nAnother one is to replace yearly reports from traineeship by an online book, accessible to everyone and encouraging discussion. And it actually did. While i was working as professor I also skipped preparing tests and asked each pupil to come up with one multiple choice question, and out of 150 of them, were chosen random 20 questions set that became the test I made an exam. It was a very democratic, surprising step for students. I tend to be also available online for my students as much as possibile and I put a lot of stress on digital learning and Open Educational Resources (OER) - to save paper, to spare their pockets, to promote more openness, to bring more p2p learning. Finally, I try to skip the usage of huge, expensive books in the classrooms - instead, I look for good, open source materials, and if they\u2019re in English, I ask my students to translate one page each and put it up in Italian as a wiki, available to everyone. There are all these ways in which students are forced to meet and talk, an essential practice, widely absent in the formal education. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m interested in joining the OPENandchange with the mission of tweaking and/or revolutionizing the classroom and the health care education and training. I want to create more opportunities for students to meet people who change the way care is given in different ways - by making devices, by creating informal institutions, in fablabs and elderly houses. I want to prepare workshops where makers and patients would be working along the health care providers on new solutions. And I want to empower alternative ways of giving care, outside of the formal profession, initiatives driven by values other than money - by the idea of being helpful, virtue of serving each other, and actual engagement. \n\u00a0\nTherefore i would like to engage other scholars, makers, educators, archivists, patients and who else inspired by an open paradigm of healthcare in contributing to a p2p learning project to advance healthcare professions curricula and innovate where possibile and to open knowledge filed the higher education for healthcare professions.

(For an account of how I came about this decision and my take on the crisis please follow this link here on Edgeryders) During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community and help with the bringing about of change. I am currently (amongst others) working on a project called \u201cReal Food Utopia\u201d as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki. (For a full list of all the projects I'm working on currently and the great and exciting things we are creating in Greece and in EU and links to many of them please look here at another of my posts).\nThe workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.\nI am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Research Group on CSA, and the European Movement for Food Sovereignty. I have been working as an activist on matters related to Food Sovereignty for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity to represent grassroots initiatives. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.\nI am interested in self-sustainability and viable solutions with regards to how we live and thrive and hence I beleive that the future lies in the creation of new types of communities, ecovillages etc, and the promotion of practices like permaculture and the blue economy model of zero emissions that can create self-sufficient farmers and viable, circular economies that not only do not pollute, but actually create more resources instead of depleting them.\u00a0 I am trying to encourage Greek people to be more involved in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market and cannot (should not) get involved in complex food chains.\nWe would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.\nWe are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an \u201cumbrella\u201d project which consists of several innovative schemes.\nThe main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece\u2019s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.\nWhat we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n\nExporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and \u201cugly\u201d fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices.\n \n\nPromotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece.\n \n\nRespond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social \u2013nonpersonal- benefits.\n \n\nReduce food waste promoting \u201cugly\u201d fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality.\n \n\nBoost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes.\n \n\nCreation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support.\n \n\nSaving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership.\n \nIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns.

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured.

It relaxes and enables them to act out. Every second week they meet up at the KitchenHub to cook. To feel secured it is important to them to be only a small and female group on those days. Therefore the size of the group is kept small even though there has been an increasing demand. Such places are rare and seem to be deeply needed. We are going to cook with one of them in a park to try out whether outside cooking especially in terms of privacy is an option for them as well or not.\nWe heard another related story at our experimental cooking night. Three friends from Syria joined us that day. Two of them are living in an emergency accommodation. The other one got transferred to another camp. The two former do not have access to any kitchen where they live, the latter can use the shared kitchen.

This is partly because we are a small crowded island and could do with more houses but it is also because we have an excess of money, and it tends to accumulate in the hands of a minority.\nIn care, the result is that individuals and even the state find it increasingly hard to acquire care homes and they attract private equity and hedge funds who treat staff as human \"resources\" and patients as \"consumers\" of health care services, squeezing the system to extract wealth.\nThis is, arguably, an extreme way of presenting the situation (after all, even hedge funds have to employ managers, many of whom are very professional and caring). However the fact is that having \"owners\" who have different drivers and values from the care-givers causes a tension that too often results in quality of care taking second place to \"delivery of health services\", which is quite a different thing.\nA useful parallel is the struggle many communities have to create affordable housing. An interesting and succesful innovation has been the community land trust, where land is acquired by or on behalf of the community and held in trust over the long term. They make the land available for affordable housing. Separating out the ownership of the land from the occupation of the land allows people who couldn't otherwise afford to occupy the land to come in and use it, subject to the conditions set down by the trust. We imagine a similar type of structure.\nTo put it another way, using financial language, owning land has a different time horizon and a different risk profile\u00a0 from owning a business.

In the end it boils down to an unsupported claim on my side. If I had written out the long version (not the 5 step click-bait style) full of \"ifs\" and \"probablies\" who would have read it? I tried to break out of that circle.\nRe \"the math post\": Not exactly the same issue, but something in the same vain I think (survival strategies). I just thought it could be good for you to have it on the radar (if you didn't already) for a variety of reasons. No new magic. End of story.\nRe survival strategies:\nYes, in my simplified way I was saying extro = r-strategists, intro = K-strategists. But please remember that what I tried to say with simple words would have been more accurately: A group of people that shares many traits with extros also shares many aspects of their survival strategy with r-strategists, and accordingly for intros and K-strategy. An examplary dynamic would be: the introvert saying: \"I knew XY before it was cool.\", implying: \"I can read weak signals (next big thing), which is highly correlated with being an introvert. I do not have to care about other people's opinion - because I am an introvert. \"Cool\" attracts extroverts whom I don't want to mingle with because they are relatively homogeneous and I am way different from them in a desirable sense (I am special). I live in a non-competitive niche, so as long as you don't piss me off I am not threat to you. If you do piss me off (e.g. because you wan to encroach on my \"territory\" with your extrovert tactics) I can employ tactics you cannot use (e.g. because you need to stay \"cool\") to ruin your day.\"\nRe random: In ecological systems there is very little random about whom you find where and how they interact with each other. Humans have filled functionally different niches (as different as say a squirrel and a goose), and accordingly adopted different survival strategies. Some rely more on a group cohesion and conformism, some (especially observable during speciation) actively try to distance themselves from the middle of the road strategies (which usually come with strong competitive pressure). Thus if people are somewhat rational about their networking, they will end up in pretty different ends of the network. This probably happens very much in an \"evolution-like\" process, after many, many interactions with varying degree of \"stickiness\". Even the varying probabilities for certain consequences may not be drastically different, the large numbers of interactions that eventually guide you to your position in the network make this effect quite significant in the end.\nWhat I should probably stress again is that the simple click-baity recipy above is not a sure-fire way to build networks on the fringes. It is more an attempt / minority opinion for raising your chances from 0.001 to 0.01 (under circumstances XYZ).", "created_at": "2016-12-30 22:46:14", "updated_at": "2016-12-30 22:46:14", "tag_id": 369, "post_id": 13828, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 4536}, {"id": 13196, "text": "", "quote": "In fact, I think we should more or less replicate it here in Brussels, for the next iteration of The Reef", "created_at": "2018-05-21 15:42:36.758120", "updated_at": "2018-05-21 15:42:36.758120", "tag_id": 2895, "post_id": 35423, "creator_id": 4155, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6892}, {"id": 5751, "text": null, "quote": "ep, when you used the word \"evolutionary\" I was pretty certain we meant the same thing.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.", "created_at": "2017-05-20 20:01:16", "updated_at": "2017-05-20 20:01:16", "tag_id": 369, "post_id": 830, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 5754, "text": null, "quote": "How to put everyone together productively without eg. 2 people having to work full time?

Pre-welfare states (19th century), welfare was basically invented by European mutual assistance societies, in turn part of the workers' movement. I imagine that, in the early days, these societies were small enough that the choice of treating someone would visibily drain the common pool of resources. So, in those days, maybe European factory workers thought a bit more like the Amish. A modern-day version of that, though I only know anecdotes about it, is implemented by @lasindias .\u00a0\nI think autonomy\u00a0is also an interesting scenario in terms of policy, and fits well into @Lakomaa 's and @Tino_Sanandaji 's institutional economics framework.\u00a0\nMy summary from the article:\u00a0\n\nThe Amish refuse to have insurance. \"When someone gets sick, the church collects alms to help the patient cover expenses.\"\nThis might happen at a time when the community has other objectives as well (\"setting up a farm for a young couple\"). You can ask of the community to support your treatment, but its\u00a0costs are not simply discharged into an anonymous \"system\": they are borne by your own brothers and sisters. As a result, everyone focuses on not spending more money than is necessary, and\u00a0\"[Amish] communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention\".\nFor this reason, the Amish use genetic screening of children. Prevention is so important that its benefits trump the disadvantages of dealing with the world at large.\nThey develop their own treatments (one for burns is described in the article). They navigate, with some difficulties, the interface with the mainstream medical world: clinical testing etc. These treatments tend to be very cheap.\u00a0\nCommunities negotiate discounts, which hospitals are willing to offer in exchange for payment in full at the time of service. In one example (a child treated with surgery for colon cancer) price was negotiated down to 19,000 USD from 172,000, a 90% discount. \"For Americans with health insurance, it may come as a surprise that hospital costs are negotiable\".\u00a0\nThe Amish don't sue. \"When the Amish told [a doctor]\u00a0they understand doctors are human and make mistakes, he had to pause to let that sink in.
