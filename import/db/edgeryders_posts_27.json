It should be for activity that is not normally done by the association (this may be different in places like Syria, etc.). \u00a0\n\nOne of my goals is to allow plurality, especially for new initiative is always hard to find funding.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, this is something that needs to be discussed in depth, the nice thing about this is that it will create a perpetual passive funding that could literally enable thousands of valuable projects to reach their goals.\n\nSo about the host you pointed out an interesting thing, the model that I described is focussed more on projects and travelers than on hosts.\u00a0\n\nI was thinking about something like having the host deciding a single project to \"pledge\", and it will gain 1 extra day on the crowdfunding platform.\n\nThis will create an incentive to find more accommodations and will engage more hosts.\u00a0\n\nMaking host deciding in large part where the money generated through their apartment goes risk to create a system where people support the project of their friend or something that they have an interest in.. But of course, it's possible to imagine also another way to let hosts support more a certain cause.\n\nAlso, I proposed a model for the organization that is based on three levels:\n\nFoundation (Take care of the platform in general and connect the global community)\n\nNational Associations (Help to select projects and to develop the organization in each state)\n\nLocal Cooperatives (A group of citizens can apply to become a cooperative, it will have dedicated projects on the platform for that particular city, the aim is to do project together maybe about certain topics).\n\nI would like to share more on this, in my opinion a worldwide mobilization on those\u00a0themes is very needed. Platforms have become the main infrastracture for the economy, we should act now where's still possible to make a change or we will be trapped:\u00a0it will be harder and harder to compete with existing one (due to their network effects, data collected, availability of money, etc)\n\n@noemi yes, but project will stay on the crowdfunding part of the platform for a limited time, so that new projects can join.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-12 13:34:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.953468", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 471, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23131], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46131, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8831, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks for the fine report.

I interviewed a few people on the street who were in a wheelchair, and did a half day experiment rolling myself in a wheelchair. It was quite an experience I have to say. I suddenly\u00a0found myself shorter than everyone else --\u00a0both physically and psychologically. Many people offered me help, and of course I told them the truth, but I felt if I were really disabled, I wouldn't simply say yes because I wouldn't want to trouble others and\u00a0would want to be as independent as possible. On the other hand, when I see a handicapped person, and a few of my classmates agreed on this, sometimes I am not sure if I should help him/her because I don't want to assume that they can't perform\u00a0certain actions and offend them.\u00a0\n\nAs time goes on, I realize the unbalance in the relationship between the abled and the disabled. The abled is always the benefit provider and the disabled is always the benefit receiver. Hence, this automatically, like you mentioned, \"belittled\" the handicapped. Therefore I began to think some solutions that can make the disabled offer something back so that the relationship between these two group could be even. We didn't spend much time on this project so my answer to my question might sound cheesy.\u00a0\u00a0I focused on wheelchair only, and added a heart-rate monitor on the handle so that the person who pushes the wheelchair could use that\u00a0time to work out.\u00a0\n\nHere is the link to the commercial I made for the product. Hope this gives you some inspirations :). \u00a0https://vimeo.com/142760828\n\nLujia\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-24 00:35:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.681258", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27087, "user_id": 59, "topic_id": 1708, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hi Luna!

Industrial policy ties into tech, innovation, data and security policy because it's ultimately about preserving the material welfare of (at least parts of) the local population. In the EU it's a huge challenge that all the local populations are not the same - e.g., benefitting ATOS will almost certainly provide a material benefit to someone in France, but it's not clear that this benefit will disseminate to other parts of Europe in equal measure.\n\nWe can interpret \"benefit\" or \"material welfare\" as in the Capabilities Approach by Sen (as proposed by @nadia  above) if that's convenient. \n\nThis opinion piece by Piotr Arak starts out a bit shaky, but I think the latter half explains pretty well the problem of a green economy from a Polish perspective: https://euobserver.com/opinion/146932 I think we could add the \"ATOS-problem\" to the complexity, e.g., Arak raises the issue of the \"materials industry problems\" (implying, I think correctly, that subsidizing the industry for eco-materials is unlikely to increase the capabilities of Polish rural communities) - and the ATOS problem is the same. \n\nIf the goal is simply to avoid quasi-monopolies like ATOS (and I'm not sure in which industry segment they'd be particularly dominant?), then perhaps ortholiberalism coupled with some Tim Wuean concept of lowered market entry barriers would be sufficient. If the goal is, on the other hand, to spread capabilities around Europe, we'd have a more difficult task at hand.", "created_at": "2019-12-18 14:04:33.152082", "updated_at": "2019-12-18 14:04:33.152082", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 38.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67113], "is_liked_by": [5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88159, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14987, "post_number": 10, "raw": "# A list of featured content selected by the Edgeryders team\nPerhaps others have additions they think we should include?

No idea if it explains traditions well, so feedback is welcome of course :) Here it is:\n\nMy take on traditions is that they form as the means to organize social life in regular, quiet, routine-based environments. But then over the course of several generations, they rigidify. What was once a helpful way to structure living together then can become an empty and legalistic rule, or even a tool for others for exerting power. High-change situations (like an earthquake, a revolution etc.) have the potential to make traditions crumble which have become too rigid and / or useless over time. I consider this a good thing everywhere in the world. It seems that social structures need a shakeup every now and then to not fossilize :) Of course, too much change is also harmful \u2026 like in medicine, where the difference between a poison and a medical drug is often just the dose \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-21 09:26:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.452480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 244, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9681, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5228, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Getting there</b>\n\nWe got everyone's account details yesterday (some of you being quicker than others).

Exploring Collective Intelligence Design](https://edgeryders.eu/t/anticipate-exploring-collective-intelligence-design/11021/35).** What follows is a brief report with some take-aways that maybe of particular interest for readers here at edgeryders. \n\nBtw, I switch from I to we not because I speak on behalf of an imagined collective whose thoughts and actions I wish to definitively interpret, but because I am both I and we, drawing on so many encounters that I often can't really claim ideas are my own anymore. It comes with the terrain, I guess - collective intelligence is something we intuitively understand to be another word for intelligence in a wider sense (we are always already multiple, constituted in multiple encounters and situations). And maybe that is the best than can happen when new terms are introduced - they change the way we use those we already have. \n\nI co-organized the event with colleagues from xm:lab and K8 (many thanks to Julia Hartnik, Agn\u00e8s Lotton, Julia Pierzina, Aude Poilroux, Michael Schmitz as well as Andrea Barbiero and Uto Scheidt) and we received financial and organizational support from Edgeryders ([@MariaEuler](https://edgeryders.eu/u/mariaeuler) and [@nadia](https://edgeryders.eu/u/nadia)). Workshops were being recorded, participants interviewed, audio podcasts are being produced.\n\nVia this post, I want to share some of our thoughts and impressions about the workshop series in Saarbruecken. \n\nBecause almost all participants spoke German (and all events were conducted in German), I am afraid that it is somewhat unlikely that our local follow-up discussions (of which there are quite a few, see below) will find their way to this platform. While event registration was set up on edgeryders for German-speaking participants, online registration was not often used, instead participants contacted the organizing team via email. \n\nFor events in languages other than English, the logic of directing those interested mainly in the offline exchange to a platform whose content is mainly in English (and which requires registration, even if greatly simplified) may have to be reconsidered. This is something I would like to think about more as we explore the role of multi-lingual online platforms in local offline conversations that see only so much added benefit in creating such a dynamic. \n\nPerhaps this is even one of the meta-takeaways from this workshop series: the role of the local, of structured face-to-face encounters integrated into a local conversation cutting across local spaces is huge. And the role of online platforms less obvious than one might have expected. \n\nHere we go, questions and answers:\n\n**Tell us about yourself. What are you working on, and why were you at the event \u2018Anticipate!\u2019?**\n\nI co-organized this event with my local colleagues because the main issues - data sovereigny and data governance as well as the community architectures structuring and sustaining such collaborative explorations - are key concerns in our work, both in education and research as well as outreach and cooperation. \n\nRecently, we have come to conduct some of these debates in the context of [anticipate](http://www.anticipate.network), our \u201ccollective intelligence design research network\u201d. I mention this specifically again because one of the concrete outcomes of the workshop series was a reworking of our [method statement](https://www.anticipate.network/what) \"principles of engagement\". We really like it, let us know what you make of it.\n\n**xm:lab** - Experimental Media Lab was set up at the Academy of Fine Arts Saar in 2012 to host cooperative degree programs (we started with Media Informatics and are now adding Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) and has since then become one of the key places on the boundaries of the academy (yes even small institutions - we have 500 students - have plenty of boundaries and need tons of interfaces to operate - one reason why design for us also means institutional design). Via xm:lab we communicate and cooperate with almost every local tech research institute, from artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to visual computing, allowing us (both educators and students) to co-create a wide variety of arts-and-technology research projects.\n\n**K8** was added in 2015 to initiate and implement transfer, think tank, and training activities both within and beyond the academy\u2019s boundaries. Recently, the role of cooperatives in organizing work and value have become a key concern, so we worked together prior to the festival with colleagues, for example, from [Salus Coop ](https://www.saluscoop.org) (mainly Andrea Barbiero) to put workshop materials together, and also reached out to some of our research colleagues to get involved in co-creating the kind of really-low-threshold formats that are surprisingly rare in our own day-to-day academic work.\n\n**What was the key question you came to the event with?**\n\nMore like a set of questions: What happens when we take themes that are still novel but no longer unique - data sovereignty, data governance, the role of decentralized technologies and community architectures in supporting self-determined data practices - and explore them through the lense of collective intelligence design?\n\n**What did you expect to learn from this event?**\n\nWe knew that the different workshops would attract different audiences but were hoping to see some cross-workshop conversation regardless. That didn't really happen to the extent we had hoped. Beyond that - we also knew that some workshop participants were already involved in data-related debates and assumed they would want to develop very concrete ideas for follow-up activities.\n\n**Did you learn what you expected? Have you heard something new? Something that you liked? disliked?**\n\nSuch insights can rarely be attributed to a single moment, but the workshops affirmed our sense of the need to address these in particular:\n\n**Low-Threshold-Formats**: We need more of those, and the workshops reminded us of how difficult it is to create conversations for people who bring concerns and interests but have little patience for the kind of academic exchanges that may or may not operate well within the boundaries and logics of academia but certainly don\u2019t easily open up to create welcoming atmospheres for first-timers. All workshops went really well, but they only did so because of the intense work of cultural translation everyone was willing to engage in. A reminder to take the work of relation into account whatever we do. \n\n**Cultural Translators**: When the local newspaper mentioned the workshop series (yeah) but concluded that its themes were probably originating in a \u201cparallel world\u201d, we had both fun and some soul-searching exhanges regarding our own sense of urgency - if the technologies we want to address and reflect upon play as large a role in reorganizing life and labor as we think they do, how come there is so little debate of (and willingness to engage with) these issues in local media (which play a huge role in local debates)? Many professional networks (take LinkedIn) amplify the connectivity of those already connected, but do little to bring new people into the loop. So instead of looking for the over-network where our visions of collective agency may or may not materialize, more cultural translators (a term adopted from [Boris Buden](http://eipcp.net/transversal/0606/buden/en.html)) that wander between the different milieus - of art, research, technology design, work, politics - are needed. This is in part how we understand our own work in events like these, and we hope that future workshops will take this on board, acting as spaces to experiment with this kind of meta-literacy that helps bring people together in more than a temporary feel-good way.\n\n**New Imaginaries**: One colleague presented current work on databases that quickly connected quantum technology imaginaries to the nuts-and-bolts questions that have to be addressed in any database design. It was a reminder that what used to be science fiction tech also offers a way of creating \u201cthinking machines\u201d, machines not to speed up whatever it is we want to organize but to allow us to think differently. We know that sci-fi has been an ongoing egderyders [concern](https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/sci-fi-economics) - and as a student of literature I had always secretly hoped that a great deal of this complicated tech research stuff would come down to imagination and language issues. It does. Until, of course, it doesn\u2019t. And yes we still have to talk about protocols, stacks, and all the rest.\n\n**What was the key takeaway from the day?**\n\nOur own enthusiasm regarding collective intelligence design does inspire occasionally but should not get in the way of getting good work done with the languages people have already available - whatever they are. There are many reasons for that - loss of experience, for example, if a story doesn't survive the retelling in a new (foreign) language (conceptual idiom, method framework, whatever). That might in fact be a dilemma of using framing narratives more generally - they facilitate sharing and yet establish a story of reference we are expected to address somehow. We do not have an answer for this yet, but then that is probably why it is a dilemma. \n\nTo our great (and not entirely surprising) relief - no matter how busy with their lives and labor, people want to work together, especially if the cooperation relates to their actual work and value-creating activities. \n\nParticipants from the data coops workshop - which included medical and database researchers as well as entrepreneurs - are now co-developing a series of health-data-related proposals, and we are in the process of initiating a regional [mydata](https://mydata.org) hub. Co-organizers from the data sovereignty workshop will be involved in an open data [hackathon](http://www.codingdavinci.de) we are organizing in 2020. And the community architectures workshop resulted in concrete cross-border cooperations between K8 and [Bliiida](http://www.bliiida.fr). \n\nWhat we learned from that (also see below): If an event is designed to contribute to an overarching process great things can happen. When it is approached as an isolated one-off, this is much more difficult. (Not exactly a new insight, but we do wonder whether the logic of \"the event\" has something to do with that.)\n\n**What would you like to learn more in depth at the next event?**\n\nAnd here we go - we are not sure events are the right category for in-depth anything. As much as I like the term (and I really like it; not only because organizing such encounters can be great work, but because in some if the humanities contexts I end up in, the German word \u201cEreignis\u201d conjures up a fair amount of philosophical controversy - and when you use it it seems that just saying it can make something happen...), process has taken over. I don\u2019t think I really want to think in terms of events anymore.\n\nInstead: what exactly is the process we are setting up, and then, what role can various elements (workshops and festivals and conferences can of course be a part of that) play? Processes are much more than a concatenation of events. What exactly that means, what processes demand from us - key question, definitely part of whatever conversation we are having prior to the next event :)\n\n**What do I see as the single largest challenge for cooperation at scale?**\n\nCooperation is happening a huge scales already - at scales that were unthinkable only a few generations (years !) ago. The workshop participants from SMEs are already operating in vast value chains, researchers are used to working with and across global scientific communities, activists (we have been looking at those interested in cooperative ethos and experiment) in networks so wide that it is nearly impossible to exhaust their scope. \n\nWorking with actors embedded in multiple networks all over the place, I am not convinced cooperation is the main thing to focus on right now. I am more interested in questions of affect and identity. I read, I see - for me language makes worlds. For many people it does not, and few of the languages we use in politics an society really seem to say what people feel. Of course this is what poetry is all about - keep creating new words so the new can continue to appear - but I would have never expected to be confronted with this in terms of the future of democracy. \n\nBut if the workshops did one thing in relationship to such broadern concerns (and these broader concerns about the future of democratic encounter and the power of co-creating the world around us are why we do such events in the first place) they were a reminder that often the way we relate to technology has nothing to do with language or knowledge and everything with much fuzzier things like feelings and a sense of self. This is not exactly an easy terrain for people like myself, trained to believe that whatever \u201canxieties\u201d exist will eventually translate into an interest in co-creating new systems. So: If cooperation is an issue, in this context it is as an issue of translation. In the widest-possible sense.\n\n**What single thing would you want to see that supports you to cooperate/collaborate more with others?**\n\nOne of the concrete outcomes of workshop-related conversations is [joint work](https://www.h3-o.de/rethink-coop.html) to change legislation related to the regulation of cooperatives in Germany. The standard business canvas and related start-up conversations leave little room for cooperatives as organizational alternative. This is unfortunate, but legislation has something to do with it so this can be addressed. (This is also what interests us in the property-design-related research agenda outlined for the [ICT-54](https://edgeryders.eu/t/applying-for-the-h2020-collective-intelligence-call-looking-for-operational-partners-and-collaborators/11974/71) proposal, btw).\n\n**What would be your message to others who did not attend this event?**\n\nTalk to us if you are in the area. I think we are familiar with many actors and initiatives you will find useful if collective intelligence is part of what you think about, and we are happy to make you part of our ongoing conversations.

You know already that the key dates are 23 - 26 of October, when we will meet in Matera to experience the annual gathering and a conference built around the topic of stewardship.\n\nBefore that, a few selected projects will be explored, improved and polished by a group of specialists during the hackathon which will take place in Matera too between 15 and 23 of October. The call for projects is still open.\n\nAs usual, while building such events there is always space for your contribution and involvement - we want LOTE4 to be yours too. We have two main fields in which you might find a perfect place for yourself:\n\n1. Be a crowdsorcerer / sorceress! Become a #LOTE4 team coordinator and get free training from Edgeryders  - this won't take all your time and energy, and it will surely give you the proper insight into what is happening in the teams, how is the event growing, and finally - bring you with us to beautiful Matera. Just check the link and drop us a line and we will happily welcome you on board.\n[https://edgeryders.eu/edgeryders-is-offering-training-on-distributed-organisation-for-lote4](/t/edgeryders-is-offering-training-on-distributed-organisation-for-lote4-team-coordinators/3475)\n\n2. Case Studies - our database of The Stewardship project is already vast (100 cases from many countries), but we need more. If you want to devote some time and energy, use your camera and practice documentation, you can either join our travelling team in one of the cities (point out new initiatives missing in the list, host someone, come to the meetup) or tell us the story from your place and let us see how the Stewardship is done there:\n[https://edgeryders.eu/stewardship-meetup-schedule](/t/stewardship-meetup-schedule/3469)\n\nHere you have the [Facebook list of our events and meetings](https://www.facebook.com/Edgeryders/events).

Because, as per my anecdotal reference, the (un)conference also resulted in interesting connections that were not at all prepared by contact on the platform. So I wondered, why is this? What would be the \"perfect\" set of connections that could be made, and what were the influences that this did not happen? And, to map my initial idea to your terms: it seems that the third mechanism \"own interests, idiosyncracies and obsessions that filter out stuff and people\" is limited by personally available time and by the platform's navigation and filtering options so that a good deal of \"chance\" influences the results of this incomplete filtering process.\n\nThe question is of course, if desigining for emergence should focus on this (assumed) \"perfect set of connections anyway\". It would need an awareness and filtering process that covers the platform as a whole, and might in this way contradict the concept of emergence coming from <em>local</em> interactions. And given enough time with the platform, the perfect (most synergistic) set of connections would probably emerge anyway.

The EU struggles with the seemingly unavoidable tendency of data to flow towards central repositories owned by big companies (Google, Facebook etc.). This creates an imbalance of power: value is created by aggregation, but almost all of it is appropriated by these companies. The response to this has so far been regulatory \u2013 making new laws or antitrust-type moves. This call is looking in a different direction: can the response be, instead, socio-technical? Can different solutions be created that are attractive enough to be adopted by a critical mass of people? The technical problem has been solved before. Two solutions have been mentioned: peer-to-peer networks and blockchain. They technically work, but have so far been unable to alter the big picture.\u00a0\n\nThe call funds proofs of concept: solutions, use cases, technical and socio-technical architectures. The deadline is April 12 2016; the total budget 5 million. DG CONNECT expect to receive fewer than 10 proposals and to fund about 2 projects.\n\nThe discussion revolved around what a prototype solution might look like \u2013 especially since it would need to be invented and deployed in a highly centralized world dominated by \"winner take it all\" dynamics, not in a tabula rasa situation.

Now because it fits into this topic, I'll share the latest insight it gave me. Of course, strictly speaking it's only my own theory about myself. But you might find elements in it that you can generalize.\n\nSo: both after the earthquake in Nepal, and now in the coronavirus pandemic, and in one more situation in the past, I observed that my body/mind system can switch to a kind of high-alert mode more or less immediately, and then stay there for considerable time (weeks to months).\n\nI'll attempt to illustrate this with the time around the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. @natalia_skoczylas had arrived 4 days before me and gone through the first 7.8M earthquake already when I arrived. She and everyone with that experience would notice all the little aftershocks, and I wouldn't notice anything. Natalia would scold me for scaring her by accidentally pushing against our office table (because it felt like an aftershock). Then there was a second, 7.3M earthquake, and afterwards I was also in that high-alert mode, being very sensitive to any slight aftershock and getting scared by any sudden movement that felt like one. We'd make little competitions of guessing the magnitude of the aftershock and then looking it up online, and quite often we were accurate earthquake sensors.\n\nThe interesting observation to me is how it only took one un-ignorable moment of danger to switch me to this high-alert mode. Some call this trauma or a psychological adjustment disorder. I think it's just an operation mode of the nervous system that we're largely unaware of but that is very useful in times of danger. It's also normal that this kind of high-alert mode fades again after a few months without that danger. Just be patient. Don't stress yourself about \"having anxiety\" or something.\n\n**tl;dr / back to the topic:** I find it useful to be *aware* of being in \"high-alert mode\" because it helps to react to statistics more rationally. Such as, by calculations (cf. [micromort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort)). I mean, numbers are just not compatible with a primal flight reflex, while both are useful. :slightly_smiling_face:", "created_at": "2020-03-16 20:23:25.822089", "updated_at": "2020-03-16 20:25:52.733958", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 45.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7041, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5364, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Community != research team</b>\n\nEzio, this is brilliant stuff, thanks. I will be breaking down my reactions into several comments, because I need to read it several times, it is so rich. For now, I would like to refer to your discussion of A1 vs. B2 OpenCare.\u00a0\n\nThe \"big scary problem\" we are looking at is, in my opinion, clearly A1. A1 is what the people out there are trying to do: rigging together DIY solutions to care problems. Where do I leave my children when I go to work, if state-provided daycare centers in Italy do not have capacity (Italy: the slots in daycare centers are 3% of the children of that age)? How do I keep on eye on the glucose in the bloodstream of my diabetic loved ones? Etc.\n\nBut, OpenCare (the project) is not open care (the activity). We are running a research project. What we research is B2: we reverse engineer how those spontaneous solutions came about. We do it by formulating hypotheses as to what kind of processes the opencarers out there used to invent and deploy their solutions. One hypothesis \u2013 that is, at the same time, an enabling condition for our own research activities is what I am going to call\u00a0the openness hypothesis:\n\n<cite class=\"content-citation\">Community-driven care solutions correlate with open collaboration and open knowledge management practices.\u00a0</cite>\n\nThis is very clear in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/health/a-do-it-yourself-revolution-in-diabetes-care.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">hacking diabetes story</a>. John Costik wrote code. If he had not open sourced it, the story would have ended there. But he did, so the next guy in the story, James Wedding, could reuse it and enrich the system. But now Wedding's own code inherited Costik's license, so it was open too,\u00a0and so on. You can do that kind of stuff with proprietary knowledge and top-down permission structures, but you need moneyed organisations. I predict community-driven solutions will depend heavily on openness.\u00a0\n\nConclusion. We study people who do A1. They will be the backbone of the OpenCare (the project) community.\u00a0We (the research team) ourselves focus on B2, and hope to learn ways that we can get more A1 stuff out there by showing people how to set their process right. This is why, though A1 is the object of our study, in practice we spend much of our time on B2.\n\nMakes sense?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-03 10:50:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.504703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 442, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39130, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7614, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yeah absolutely.

How to communicate and negotiate around the different needs, capacities, permission/willingness to get involved and constraints of both caregivers and care recipients. In part because the boundaries between the roles are fluid, especially in trying to deal with psycho-social distress involved.

I mention it because I think this is something we could look into: how a network can help the individual nodes both identify signs of trouble, collude to preventing them from happening, as well as identify and respond to calls for help.

I hope never to have a to do a job only for practical/financial reasons. In order to achieve this, I have aimed to build experience in my field of interest over the years. Often this has involved doing unpaid internships. I have been lucky enough to have friends who have taken me in when I couldn't afford to pay the rent as I was doing an unpaid internship, supplemented by other jobs (tutoring, babysitting etc. to earn enough to feed myself at the same time).\n\nIt is the time of the year when we are coming to the end of the academic session and the university careers office is bombarding us with internship opportunities over the summer. Almost all of these (except the ones in the financial services sector) are unpaid. Many of these internships are abroad in other European capital cities. I honestly do not understand how they expect young people just coming out of education (with huge debts) to be able to work full time for free, pay for their flights, accomodation and daily sustenance. These organisations either assume that everyone is rich or they are turning a blind eye to the plight of the disadvantaged and financially less well-off in society, thereby entrenching social inequalities. I remember feeling absolutely scandalised and disgusted when the head of a UN organisation who had come to give a careers talk at our university early on in the year, when asked about the culture of unpaid internships in the organistion, replied in a blasse manner that 'we expect your parents to pay'. Okay, so he was at the LSE where a significant number of the postgraduate community includes members of the\u00a0 international elite. But there were also people like me whose parents CANNOT pay for them. This reeks of hypocrisy especially when the same organisation is claiming to fight poverty and social injustice across the world. So, whilst my colleagues were doing internships in Brussels and the Hague over the Easter break thanks to the bank of mum and dad, others like myself were denied these same opportunities by being inadvertently excluded through the unpaid internship schemes run by many governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.\n\nIn my experience therefore, one of the biggest roadblocks I have faced in looking for a job is the pervasiveness (and the unacceptable acceptance) of unpaid internships. This is because internships often provide an important entry point into a career.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-16 14:57:41", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 04:09:46.525885", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 432, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 185.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37008, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 7180, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Thanks @noemi for the friendly introduction, i appreciate that :) \nmy morning coffee routine is quite simple.

In many ways the tech part is the easiest (and is more about operational effectiveness on the ground and less about approaching the requirements of replication). At this point we have much of the raw data needed for the replication of unMonastery - what we don't have is the entry point, the top level access point, or a means of organising and rationalising the data. \u00a0\n\nWhat I've been veering towards in thinking and conversation with <a href=\"/u/ola\">@Ola</a>\u00a0is a methodkit iteration for unMonastery, cards that signal the baseline requirements of an unMonastery, with a corresponding wiki that uses the same taxonomy, so that anyone can take the pack of cards plan their model and easily reference the history and patterns of what's gone before.

This is interesting. I agree with at least some of it.\n\nI don't know about the figures you mention and how they play out in my country, but I do know that at local level, big influxes of immigrants have put strains on schools and hospitals. The rate of change has been rapid over the last fifteen years. The unprecedented immigration rates in the UK represent two things to me: one, big business running the show (it's all about the cheap labour); and two, a state trying to shore against the decline represented by an ageing population.\u00a0\n\nPart of the resentment against this comes from a sense that some immigrant communities have not integrated, and some of the rest comes from a sense of imposition. But that sense of being left behind is palpable in some places. We are lucky in Britain that we have no serious far right grouping. I think we do pretty well at mixing and matching here, which is something to be proud of, but there are always limits.\u00a0\n\nAgain though, I think community is the key here. I don't think most people have any problem with immigrants, because immigrants are just people. On an individual level, meeting people from other countries is interesting and welcome to most. Immigrants who move to a new place and bed themselves in are mostly made welcome, and very often breathe new life into places. The problems come again when the number and rate of change is too ... big. Again, it's about scale, and about belonging.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-24 07:44:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.823612", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9690], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14213, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2679, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>all good ideas</b>\n\nyes, all good ideas\n\nskype group calls are good alternative,\n\nwe could have up to 25 people on the call at the same time\n\nmaybe there would be many people from the workshops that want to join so it would work best\n\nand most people are familiar with skype\n\nto make it easy, we could set up a group conversation on skype\n\nso that everyone could catch up there\u00a0\n\nrecently I'm practicing this solution and it works well\n\nthat's why I recommend it :)\n\nmy skype is Dorofia\n\nif you want to know more how to do it,\n\nor you are not familiar with it, you can ping me on skype\n\nI think it would be good to set up a general skype group for calls and conversations\n\nso that we could always know where to find each other on skype :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-07 09:12:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.383605", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 166, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5455, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5422, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The Edgesense script runs every day driven by cron, as planned (<a href=\"/admin/edgesense/script-run\">see here</a>).

The \"dashboard\" neither looks remotely like a dashboard nor is labelled \"dashboard\". \"Updates\" as a label works for me OK, but then the page is called, confusingly, \"What's going on?\" when it may not be at all clear at first sight that what is there is a selection governed by individual choices. Personally I hadn't come across drop-down menus looking like ordinary links before. It would help if they were given a \"hover\" pop-up title.\n\nThe content menu is a bit of a surprise. There aren't any questions and answers, so that is rather puzzling, though could be really useful. Maybe take them out and put back in when there is a clear facility to ask questions and have them answered? Also, the difference between a page, a post and a wiki could be explained somewhere. Is a wiki simply an editable page? The page/post distinction is perhaps familiar to people who have used WordPress, but not at all clear to beginners. Why would people want to see one and not the other? Why can't one ask for new comments, as well?\n\nThis reminds me of usability\u00a0thoughts over many years. Extra features and options tend to confuse beginners, who get lost (and may be put off). If there were a way of turning off advanced features until asked for, that would be great. (Then check how many people actually use them!)\n\n\"Following\" and \"not following\" is logical, though rather surprising (again potentially confusing to newcomers) that I can look at specifically what I am not following. Could there more simply be an \"all\" option?\n\n\"last updated first\" unfortunately means that, as I have updated some of the really old blog posts, they are now coming up on top of that list. Could that be, additionally or instead, the original publication date?\n\nWhat I think I would be looking for, and would be most useful to me, would be (given I am logged in) something like a \"show me what I haven't seen already\", which isn't there -- yes, the options of following and all would still be useful here.

Re 2, I added links <a href=\"/t/title-missing/1811\">here</a>. In general, we could add links that go from the minisite into the workspace.\n\n\"Count me in\"... the hard part is building alternative pages to test! I think we would use our time well in testing:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>the home page, obviously. About 12% of all page views...</li>\n\n<li>the profile page. This is less obvious, but then I remembered reading of this pattern from Ning. On Edgeryders, more than 8% of all page views since we are tracking are profile pages. Our profile pages are ugly as hell, with too many fields and some missing information! Incidentally, I know how many profile pages get viewed because there is a neat trick to count classes of pages dynamically generated: go to the Content =&gt; All pages report in GA. Look for the search field, then click on \"advanced\" and select a search \"Starting with\", then type \"/users/\". This generates a search of all pages of type https://edgeryders.eu/users/XXXXXXXXX, and you can see how many they are.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI think the way to go is to create system pages with different urls (for example \"/start\" instead of \"/home\". Design them according to some hypothesis. For example: the hypothesis \"people want to see activity streams more than they want to see featured content\" would generate a home page based on feeds and streams of things that happen.

I don't want to seem too rejecting of 'classroom' per se. I think I'm most concerned about the conventional ways that classrooms and educational superstructures are organised which leads to frustration for many learners. When I say that classroom or group learning holds people back, I should qualify that to say that I don't believe learning is a race, and I don't really believe that we should divide people into quick or slow learners and group them accordingly. Most people can be really quick learners when they are motivated but for some of us, our brains slow right down to the pace of a snail stuck in tarmac when anxious or bored. The conventional classroom privileges skills with abstract symbolisation over skills with your body, forms, materials, nature and images. So, only those of us quick with words and numbers are judged to be quick learners.\n\nIt's not so much that when you learn in groups you're pulled back to the lowest or average common denominator of ability, it's more that there's little scope for following personal flight paths of learning. Sometimes those flight paths of learning really gain from being slowly paced, letting you churn over difficult ideas or tasks over and over again.\u00a0\n\nI do quite enjoy learning with others. I am a social learner and I think learning should be social. I don't like being duty bound to a particular group, in one space and a particular course of study for too long. Conventional classrooms are not actually geared towards social learning. They aren't flexible enough and they are too focused on individual exam success. Achievement-oriented learning tends to put people in cohorts, as if they are on a race track, and then attempt to drive them towards personal achievement in competition with the others. You are trapped with others for years on end, competing with them. Hell!\n\nE-learning is exciting because it offers opportunities for us to design alternative structures for learning so that it is both more personalised (you choose to come, work to your interests and at your pace) and more socially oriented (peer to peer relationships, learning towards 'bigger than self' outcomes). \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-19 13:17:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.440190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 395, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84091, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 158, "raw": "Please refer back to the hierarchies portion of the Open Ethnographer manual (and my prior posts on the subject, including notes from calls where we all discussed this).

There's a two-level mission report categorization in addition in Edgeryders, but that's about it. Which means that one can also run the same network analysis on Diaspora data.\n\nThe thing that makes people post longer and more elaborate posts and comments on Edgeryders is how the site is presented, what wording is used, how the forms are made (editor field size, rich text editor or not etc.). That could be adapted when running an own Diaspora pod, and also some local extensions can be developed that keep compatible with the Diaspora pod-to-pod protocol but add additional local options, like the \"mission report\" categorization scheme.\n\nSo technically and from personal preferences, I'm all for integrating with open social networks, as it can be a good give and take with many others. The question, as I see it, is this: When others interact with Edgeryders content, using their own pods that do not have the Edgeryders style nudging towards producing longer and high-quality content, will it hinder the goals / decrease the output quality of the project? Or is this overcompensated by the new input from relative outsiders, plus, that they could be drawn to the Edgeryders interfaced Diaspora pod for creating longer content pieces themselves?\n\nOther question: How to handle the intended more anonymous / privacy protected options for data entry for \"ethnographic stories\" on Edgerders? No idea how to integrate that cleanly with the Diaspora user concept so far ...\n\n<strong>Update:</strong> Oops ... used the wrong button.

This could be fundamental to the opencare vision.\u00a0\n\nWe propose that communities are good candidates for being caregivers, because they are fair (they share the burden across individuals), efficient (allocation of who takes care of whom is based on self-selection: low overhead, you give care when and where you are readiest/most motivated to do so, receive it in the time and domain of your greatest need), and retain a human touch that state-and private sector provided care cannot (you care for your own, etc.). This is predicated on\u00a0the givers and receivers of care recognizing each other as one: everyone is part of the same \"we\". When a person is recognized as\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>part of the \"we\", the community's incentive to care for her fails.\u00a0\n\nAnd it would be unwise to put it down to human error or happenstance.\u00a0Some scientists argue convingly that for humans to divide between \"us\" and \"them\"\u00a0is innate, because in our hunter-gatherer past we evolved under selection pressure at the group level.

Facial recognition apps and contract tracing apps have been called into question around the world. Security experts and people like whistleblower Edward Snowden have spoken out about the danger of passing laws around the collection of personal data during the crisis.\n\nIn fact, [our most recent ethnography findings](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14544) show this was a prominent conversation on the platform over the past four months. Our community has been talking about the risks and harms that these applications and technologies have to data privacy and our civil liberties.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear these issues are going away.. Just last week Amazon announced a new palm recognition system that let\u2019s people scan into its shop by waving their hand at the door. It has privacy experts concerned that a biometric scanner that sends pictures of people\u2019s palms into the cloud could be a security risk but will current habits that are being formed around these technologies throughout the pandemic have far-reaching consequences later?\n\nWe have also been examining how an internet that depends on ad revenue to operate and examining the recent policy brief published by Mozilla Fellows Harriety Kingaby and Frederike Kaltheunejust on how that can be fixed [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/114).\n\nOther conversations that have featured prominently on the platform include coworking, according to our findings. It seems apparent that many have tasted working from home, and while it doesn\u2019t work from everyone, some people have trialled it and like the freedom it brings. One aspect that garnered a lot of attention around that was how the coworking sector can [incorporate childcare ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14331)to help working parents during current restrictions.\n\nSimilarly, there has been a lot of talk on the platform on how we can recover from the fallout of this pandemic, and make the pathway we choose a [green one](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14522).\n\nWe have been reacting to these conversations and discussions, by putting together some events that our community can benefit from. On the 22nd October we are running a webinar that explores what freelancers need to improve their working  days. Please [come along](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/) if you\u2019re a freelancer that doesn\u2019t know what to do with all the technology available for the sector to utilise.\n\n**Don\u2019t forget\u2026**\n\nSome of our other upcoming events:\n\n* 16/10 : [Info session about our new World Building academy! ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14481)We are launching a residency in collaboration with EIT Climate Kic as part of our Scifi Economics Lab.\n* 29/10: [How can we work together to support localisation of food? 1](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-event-invitation-sustainable-agriculture-and-food/14493) A webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond.

What makes the ailment\u00a0even more intimidating is that the symptoms keep varying\u00a0from person to person and we never know in what way is going to affect the patient. Wave, as our team is called, is trying to make someone suffering from parkinson's and their caregiver's lives easier using technology that we have today at our disposal.\n\nThe first signs of someone having parkinson's are the motor symptoms. These symptoms include essential tremors in hands and other parts of the body. These symptoms further advance overtime enough that it makes it difficult for them to perform the easiest of daily tasks.\u00a0The symptoms occur when the level of dopamine, the chemical responsible for body movement coordination, reduces in the brain. Medication is used to replenish the dopamine levels or fake the action of the dopamine.\n\nWith our prototype, we propose to make the lives of someone with parkinson\u2019s simpler. Our prototype will be wearables that can monitor the motor symptoms of the patient.\u00a0Our prototype will monitor the common symptoms like tremor and stiffness in the human body, and if the symptoms are showing an uncommon behaviour, the prototype can beam the information to the smartphone to remind the patient or the caregiver to take the medicines to or to see the neurologist.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/debddd822467434c57a0ba01adb0fdd890641b9d.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"500\">\n\nOur goal is to help someone who has recently started showing symptoms of parkinson\u2019s to track their motor symptoms and also prolong the initial stage as much as possible.\n\nA lot of research-based apps and services are available today that help in better understanding the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. Apps like mPower and Parkinson\u2019s Central are monitoring the patient\u2019s health from their rdaily movements and tasks along with daily or weekly surveys.

Negotiating insurance packages as a coworking collective and helping to nurture female entrepreneurship are some of the positives of working in these environments. Read on for more examples.*\n\n\n## Stronger together\n\n\u201cCoworking Toronto ... actually gathered the coworking players and then they could negotiate with the insurance industry because you know, when coworking, most of the members over there are gig economy, freelancers. And then many people don't want to go through the entrepreneurs' path because of the income security, the benefits and all that. And then they thought, so what if you don't enforce it? All of our members combined, definitely, we can negotiate for certain packages with the insurance company.\u201d\n\n## How coworking can work to incentivise female entrepreneurship in Montenegro\n\n\n\u201cOne year ago there were less than 2% of female entrepreneurs in our country, which is very, very low...They're (the government) trying to raise that number for both startups and female and male entrepreneurs. But let's say we have kind of a positive impact to doing that in the last two years\u2026 So, we see our (coworking space) purpose of changing that mindset and helping them doing work and running projects on their own and running businesses, small stores, whatever it is, whatever they find useful to grow the economy.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that will hit us even harder just because of that kind of mindset, because we are naturally entrepreneurial people. And this is something that you have to start working immediately and to dedicate all our efforts on the governmental level to help our young people to really think differently.\u201d\n\n ## Ecosystem builders\n\n\u201cThe majority of the audience (in Indonesia) who are using coworking spaces, their average rate of income per year is double than the conventional workers. So, from like 4% (for the) conventional one to 8% for the millennials. Other statistics show that actually 80-something percent of people think that they got a really relevant professional network. And then 64% got job referrals and projects from the coworking network.\"\n\n\"So  we always highlight economic impact...So, it's all about distributing equal opportunity of access,\u201d\n\n**Government paying $10,000 for people to move to Oklahoma city**\n\n\u201cThey've actually done a top down perspective, which has allowed for the government to promote it as well, and actually put some funding into it, which allows for these spaces to develop. It allows for remote workers to come in and have a space to work from, but also see that there's industry available. So initiatives like paying $10,000 to just have someone move to Oklahoma. that's an incentive enough to kind of bring industry to this area and try to get it to boom.\n\n\u201c...there is a bunch of unused or underutilized funding out there that could tie into these initiatives to make it work and allow for people to access that and build it out and put your place on the map or again, bring it to rural communities.\u201d\n\n## How coworking spaces impact an areas economic development\n\n\u201c... The Coworking library, I  think they are based in the UK and what they are trying to do is a lot of research and data in coworking industry. I was talking to one of the researchers on the impact of a creative hub or creative coworking spaces or players have in the ecosystem of the economic development of a city... And then you can actually see that economic development around the neighborhood will change. But then the change you can actually see probably after one and a half years to three years time, that actually happened in one of the area in Bali.\n\n\u201cIt used to be an Aflac district before a creative hub was actually there and then (it) started to pull all these nice programs and community artists, young people. And then you can actually see that the whole street was starting to light up, before it's so dodgy and dark. People open up restaurants and then some other facilities... different type of community, that normally didn't want to go there.\u201d\n\n...\n\n**Do you think coworking players are ecosystem builders too?

That's easy, when you are not a company. All of these contortions were meant to <em>preserve</em> the way of working that was already there, and (we think) is efficient and comfortable.

We collect knowledge and practices that people in different sectors are using to keep their businesses afloat right now. People discuss and share advice with one another by leaving thoughtful comments to each article. Contributors then receive invitations to opportunities for further learning and collaboration.**\n\n*In one of our breakout sessions at our coworking event participants shared their first-hand experience of what\u2019s happening in the sector. Interestingly the number of workers returning to spaces seems dependent on location, with players in London finding people slower to return to buildings than those based in Barcelona.*\n\n## Thoughts from London\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quieter, even though we've opened up a lot of (other) stuff. I don't know what everybody else has seen, but it is definitely quieter because new behaviours have been formed to a certain point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn London we have a call twice a week with coworking spaces and people from across the UK gatecrash it, but mainly it's people in London. It's been a slow... there's places that are established that never closed and they were only open to members. So people kept on going in.\n\n\u201cMainly it's because people just don't want to travel. And there's other spaces that haven't opened because as soon as they're kind of bigger. As they open it will cost them to be open. And they don\u2019t know what's going to happen. The biggest takeaway is spaces that had a very strong sense of community are struggling because of business rates and stuff like that.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026every borrower does business rates differently. So, some people got paid out and support straight away, and some people are arguing about how their coworking spaces\u2026 And even people paid more to be there and things like that to make sure it survived.\n\n\u201cWith places that just rented desks, people just cancelled their membership, but (we have heard) even some stories of bigger, more commercially, corporate-y, realists that they place are trying to sue people for canceling their membership. And then the people who cancelled their membership are saying: \u2018Well, I paid membership for all this stuff and none of it's available cause you closed it because the COVID. So I'm not paying that amount of money just for a desk.\u2019\u201d\n\n## Thoughts from Dublin\n\n\u201cWeek one, bar two people, there's one guy who basically had the place to himself. It was like a penthouse looking out on the sea and he would have kids at home. So, it was completely safe and he did keep going back in, but everybody else, I mean, everybody reversed, everyone just shut down. And in fairness to our government, and they stepped in and helped everybody immediately, with all the COVID payments.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 all the members stopped. Now, we didn't know\u2026We kept saying (that) we hoped that it is a pause button, not a cancellation button. And we can slowly see people starting to even ask can they even come back in for a couple of hours now?\n\n\u201cIf people have children at home and we don't know whether they\u2019re going back to school in September, the kids. Certainly, childcare is a big problem, but again, it's the same everywhere.\u201d\n\n## Thoughts from Barcelona\n\n\u201cI had a crazy last few months. Barcelona actually reopened a decent amount. I went to a couple of coworking spaces there before I left. I went actually, so I went a couple of times just to see how it changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when it first opened within the first week, there was a small number of people, like one or two, and they'd only opened one of the three floors at the space I went to. When I went back, three or four weeks later, they had opened up one of the other floors cause they they were trying to make decisions on how they reopened and they were really just doing it based on the demand of people actually showing up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so they really may only make decisions to change. They, we were at a bit of a distance and then they the typical, let's clean our hands and all stay away from each other a little bit, but no one was wearing a mask inside. But the cleanliness was pretty well kept up, but that was really about all they did. Like I didn't see a whole lot of other protocols that they put in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven't seen it in Barcelona (screens). I saw a conversation in Tel Aviv, they did that in Israel. That they did it in some of the spaces that opened up. Granted they're closing back down a little bit. So, we'll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general it's mainly just been distancing. And then some level of wearing a mask a little bit more often. That's mainly what I've seen, but when I was there, I don't know, I kind of go through stages.\u201d\n\n...\n## What has your experience of coworking been throughout the pandemic?

Hirschman_\n\nSo you are worried, restless, outraged. In a little over a year, you have watched cynical, myopic politicians manipulate electorates into making disastrous choices. Meanwhile, precious attention is being diverted from issues that really matter, like climate change, privacy, inequality and regulating AI. You know you will personally have to bear some of these costs, even though you had no part in those choices. You are seeing your rights reduced (Brexit), your national prestige sinking (Trump), the effectiveness of your government curtailed (German elections), your non-white or wrong-surname friends and family members being humiliated and made feel unwelcome (all of the above). Now what?\n\nOne of the heroes of my youth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_O._Hirschman\">Albert Hirschman</a>, has an answer to that. You can do one of three things:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Exit</strong>. Refuse to touch the problem, and leave your nation or community behind to deal with it. They made the mess, let them clean up.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Voice</strong>. Engage with the status quo. State your concern and grievance, and try to change it through applying some kind of pressure.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Loyalty</strong>. Suck it up, and live with it. It's not that bad after all, at least not for you personally.</li>\n</ol>\nLoyalty is, of course, far and away the most popular method. This is because most things in human affairs work reasonably well. With your attention absorbed by corporate greed, climate change and the refugee crisis it is easy to overlook that traffic laws and the drinking water infrastructure work quite well, at least in my corner of the world. Most people will simply stay loyal and move on. But what if you can't live with it? Do you exit or voice? and how?\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">In 2017, as I pondered these questions in relations to my own life and work, I stumbled onto two new books that argued different corners of the question. </span>\n\nThe first one is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lobbying-Change-Create-Better-Society/dp/1785782851\">Lobbying for change</a>, by my countryman and co-conspirator Alberto Alemanno. Alberto, a legal scholar, makes a resounding case for voice. His experience as an activist and campaigner taught him that decision makers are often much more open to take on board ideas and suggestions than you might think. This, he argues, is especially true when ideas and suggestions come from citizens, because a citizen's economic interests are thought to align with that of society as a whole, or at least of large groups within society.\n\nAlberto's main intuition is this: citizen lobbying is fuelled by discontent, but it ends up producing greater societal cohesion. This is because lobbyists are by definition not themselves decision makers. So, nothing they do will work if it does not channel that discontent into a proposal that benefits them, and that the other interested parties can at least live with. In order to protect her interest or argue her cause, the citizen lobbyist cannot but help the common good. The book then proceeds to plot a course for anybody willing to be a citizen lobbyist to become an affective one. In a way, it's a user's manual for Hirschmanian voice.\n\nAn aside is in order. Of course, in the lobbying game \"interested parties\" are only those who sit at the table and argue for themselves. Those who don't (because they are politically weak, like the Roma in Europe, or because they are not human, like the climate) are fair game, and they have generally not fared well even under advanced democracies. This is, however, a problem with voice <em>in general</em>, not with Alberto's contribution. In fact, citizen lobbying is meant to be cheap enough that weaker and even non-human parties can find at least <em>some</em> voice.\n\nThe second book is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkaway_(Cory_Doctorow_novel)\">Walkaway</a>, by science fiction author and Boing Boing editor Cory Doctorow. It is firmly in the exit camp \u2013 even in its title. Doctorow is an interesting author, one of a small milieu of SF writers who write honest-to-God philosophical fiction. It's a bit like reading <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>: characters spend a lot of time explaining each other the economic, philosophical and technological foundation of the imaginary societies they live in. Doctorow stands apart from other authors in this group in that he is by far the most concerned with economics : in fact he himself claims that <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2017/05/10/coases-spectre/\"><em>Walkaway</em> is really about the Coase Theorem</a>.\n\n<em>Walkaway </em>imagines a near future society where open source technology is advanced enough that people can drop out of mainstream societies in a relatively order manner, and live off the land and dirt-cheap open tech. And they do: the combined effect of automation and mounting income and wealth inequalities make it so that meaningful employment is almost impossible (unless one enjoys serving the only healthy market, that of really rich people). People are knee deep in student debt. Most of humanity has simply nothing to offer to \"the economy\" and the society it supports. So they walk away, and provide to their needs with the same logic that Wikipedians deploy to build Wikipedia. Initially this gives rise to a sort of dual economy, with a large fringe (maybe 5% of the population?) living in Walkaway. Later on, the mainstream economy kind of eats itself, so that the share of humans in Walkaway rises significantly. Walkaway itself becomes a sort of mainstream, with super-rich people and their minions continuing to run places like London and Singapore, but not much else.\n\n<em>Walkaway</em> argues for exit because it lays out a political strategy that leads people to winning by refusing to engage. Cannot get a decent job and pay your student loan? Walk away. The police evacuates the open source compound where you live? Walk away, rebuild it 50 kilometers down the road. They take that down too? Walk away. In the end, walkaway \"wins\", but that's not even the point. The point is that you can make a better life for yourself by <em>not</em> engaging with the system.\n\nLike most people reading this, I am <em>very</em> dissatisfied with some of the things that are going on in the world right now. I can not live with them. Which one is it going to be, voice or exit? I have been a voice guy all my life, but now I wonder. I can see a game -theoretical argument for exit: if you commit to voice, the powers that be can stall you forever, while you exhaust your energy for change in endless negotiations. Exit \u2013 walkaway \u2013 has a key advantage: if you execute well, its results do not depend on your opponent. This is not a theory, but a fact. All your energy goes into making a better life for yourself and your loved ones, on your own terms. If you believe Doctorow's intuition, there is another advantage: if enough people exit your opponent are going to be badly hit. That gives you potentially significant clout as you walk away (even though this is not even a theory, \"intuition\" is a better description).\n\nSo, I guess, at a minimum, voice should not be taken for granted. Engagement and participation should be economised, and always be underpinned by an ever present, credible, threat of exit. Building \"credibility\" in this sense means building as much autonomy as you can. This is what <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage\">we are looking into</a> at Edgeryders. And you?

We just need to add a catching title and a call to action at the end of the article.\nAll these content must be produced on a topic related to the webinar theme. Then, once we have the main content/topic we decline it into a newsletter, a set of graphics for the ads, a piece for the press officer (ideal to be published into a newspaper/magazine/blog), a drip campaign for automation, a series of tweet we can schedule and so on. \nIt is very useful then to create a calendar so we can organize the delivery of all these content knowing what will be published, when and what to expect.\n\nBecause the amount of work I would suggest to produce content able to create awareness, but also conversions. In our case conversion means to subscribe to edgeryders and be part of the conversation around this topic especially in the webinar so we can push people to tell their story or tell us about something that somewhere in the world is happening and achieve the goal we are looking for. \n\nThe general scheme of production-delivery-follow-up after the conversion will be the same for each topic, so we don't have to reinvent the weel and we measure everything.

Sorry I haven't been very active in this discussion, although I have been thinking a great deal about the role of culture in our current COVID-19 dominated society, and particularly the implications post COVID. My view is that the other side of the coronavirus epidemic will be very different to the world we left behind at the start of 2020. Many people will have lost their lives. Many more will be grieving or wounded or scared. Many jobs and livelihoods will be gone, along with businesses, charities and cultural organisations.  Certain former dreams of people working in the cultural sector may be irrelevant or impossible to deliver because they were built on foundations that can no longer support them. \nThe pandemic may mark a boundary between certain older institutions, support systems, roles and relationships, and new ways forward that are likely to be quite different. From my perspective, the role of culture (broadly defined) and the arts (also broadly defined) will be central to the discovery of a livable answer. Through culture, experiences and viewpoints are exchanged; we understand difference and tolerate opposition. Culture is the space where we meet and learn to live together, Culture may be one of those keys to recovery and the values that will shape the next chapter of our history. We now need fresh thinking about that new chapter.\nYou ask what I am seeing happening in the cultural networks of which I am a part.

I\u00a0wanted to start an experimental process to give the three floors a new life through common principles, sustainable design and open source thinking. After talking with a few dozen of people, 5 people formed the first network.\n\nThe premise: find out through a collaborative way of work how different people can repurpose an empty space an share own project and collective ones to better the way we live in Brussels. We took inspiration out of Fablabs, Livinglabs, coworking space and are testing out every tool they are proposing to see which ones fit in this space.\n\nOn the long term we want to become an example that can be reproduced in any space above a shop in Brussels. And the numbers are in our favour, cause as much as (fill number here) is inaccessible but also unused space that could bring a maker and creative community back to the city center.\n\nAt this point we are 6 months further and have a working core team with a broth network of all kind of social, cultural and technological organizations around us.

I see a version of this in pretty much all of the big service providers, though I was not aware of CDN's doing this until I read your essay.\n\nI think that while much of the rationale for such censoring actions get expressed as some sort of service to the public, in fact the purpose of those actions is more in service of those providers maintaining control over their user base, which in turn helps their bottom line.  Calling themselves a public utility is feel-good PR because as you say, there can be no true public utility without public oversight.\n\nI do not think the Internet is in a wild west. Those days passed long ago.  We are in a period of large-scale top-down control that helps itself by perpetuating an illusion of a wild west.", "created_at": "2020-08-22 17:01:01.959631", "updated_at": "2020-08-22 17:01:01.959631", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 188, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15977, "user_id": 3220, "topic_id": 5650, "post_number": 3, "raw": "hey @asimong welcome back to the edge :-).\n\nIt's a quiet interesting thought.

Please consider applying. In this post you find the relevant information.\n\n![image|690x647, 75%](upload://w3FDAniiu0GOLGdhhyH3NhJugEx.jpeg) \n\n### Concept\n\n*Worldbuilding* is the activity of constructing an imaginary world, often for the purpose of acting as the backdrop for a creative endeavor (a book, a film, a video game). Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a history, geography, and ecology is a key task for many science fiction or fantasy writers.\n\nWe (FdCM and SF-ECON) want to develop an open source world to set speculative fiction (sci-fi or fantasy) in. Its chief characteristic is that it pays attention to its economy: behavior, dynamics and institutions. We aim to create an exciting setting for works of fiction, based on economies that are ideally radically different from our own, and yet believable.\n\nFrom this exercise, we hope to learn about what kind of economic systems people are attracted to (or repelled from). We plan to treat the materials produced by the Worldbuilding Academy as a sort of ethnography of utopia. In this sense, this is also a research project.\n\n### Development\n\nThe development process has two components.\n\n* **Our writer-in-residence provides, top-down, a general overview of the world**, determining broad characteristics such as the world\u2019s inhabitants, technology level, major geographic features, climate, and history. The broad architecture of this world could include different social and economic spaces to provide more diversity and contrast. This is a familiar technique in speculative fiction, from Anarres and Urras in LeGuin\u2019s The dispossessed, to the Hives in Ada Palmer\u2019s Terra Ignota series, all the way to Tolkien\u2019s economic geography where the small commerce of the Shire contrasts with the heavy industry of Orthanc.\n* **Anyone can then take part in \u201cfilling in\u201d, bottom-up, the inevitable gaps**. Using the Harry Potter saga as an example, Rowling has invented (top-down)[ wizarding money](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizarding_currency). But readers do not know if it is pegged to gold (as suggested by the fact that their cash is minted in precious metals: but then who is to prevent wizards and witches to magic more metal into existence?), or of it is a full fiat currency; the role of the different wizarding currencies in regulating foreign trade, and so forth. This leaves a space for Harry Potter fans to design, bottom-up, their own wizarding equivalent of central banks, the WTO, the IMF, and so on. This part will be led by SF-ECON, which already has a small, but active, community.\n\n### Intellectual property rights\n\nAfter the information session of October 16th, a clarification on IPRs:\n\n* The **Worldbuilding Bible** or **Worldbuilding Canon**, the world itself, is the intellectual property of its author(s),  but must be licensed with a [Creative Commons \u2013 Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). \n* Any actual work set in the world described thereby (novel, or short story, or film, or game, or economics paper or whatever), is the intellectual property of its author(s), who license(s) it or not any way they want. Since the world is open source, these rights are not tainted by claims over the creative input that went into making the world. \n\n### Practical info\n\n**Where?** In Messina, Sicily. You will be the guest of FdCM, headquartered in an inspiring seaside location, on the strait overlooking mainland Italy. FdCM is experimenting in creating a radically different economic system in the city \u2013 you are encouraged to hang out with them, learn about it and be inspired.\n\n**When?** The period is flexible, but it should be no more than 15 days long and end by the 1st of December.\n\n**What about logistics?** FdCM will cover your travel costs up to 500 EUR; provide you with a small lump sum for incidentals (1,000 EUR); and provide you with a car. It will also provide a completely autonomous apartment and a writing space. FdCM will do their best to make you feel welcome, and Sicilian hospitality is legendary!\n\n### Who should apply, and how to apply\n\nWe welcome applications from absolutely anyone who cares about our collective capacity to imagine completely different economic systems. It will help if you are a speculative fiction author, economist, anthropologist, social scientist, but it's not necessary.\n\nWe are also looking for **illustrators** and **video producers** who can produce illustrations and video material for marketing purposes of the Worldbuilding Academy project. The terms are a one month contract as a service provider engaged for one month for an estimate of 1 week of work.\n\nRemuneration for this part will be agreed on mutually convened deliverables at the contract negotiation phase following this call. The reason for this is that we are aware of different skill levels, hourly rate and time constraints that candidates might have, and wish to be able to accommodate that.\n\nTo apply, write a short letter of intent to [andreja@edgeryders.eu](mailto:andreja@edgeryders.eu). Explain how you propose to go about building this world. Add a CV, or a link to one, or a link to your personal website, or anything else that allows us to learn more about you. If you are a graphic or video artist, we would like to see a couple of samples of your work. We may ask for a call to ask you some questions and clarifications.\n\nThere is no deadline per se, we review the applications as they come and stop when we find a suitable candidate. If you have questions, just ask them here; or in the [online information session](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-if-the-future-of-economics-is-invented-in-science-fiction-tickets-122119644143) that takes place on October 16th, at 2pm Brussels time.", "created_at": "2020-10-01 13:06:18.754375", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 15:29:35.802686", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 974, "wiki": false, "reads": 49, "score": 3374.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 5, 5393, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 595, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 562, "post_number": 1, "raw": "One the more difficult challenges in trying to collaborate with others around addressing a problem is finding where interests converge, or diverse.

We need a plan B. \n\nI am just fantasizing here, and of course open to all kinds of alternative proposals. But we could do this: \n\n1. See if we can find some extra resources to onboard two writers rather than one.\n1. Schedule a SF-Econ Lab webinar with our chosen writer(s). to happen in 2020. A possible date could be December 1st. \n2. Do a bit of work from here to there to set up an online space for collaboration. \"Set up\" means that, of on December 2nd I go online determined to help figure out what means of exchange works for interstellar trade in the world under construction, I find some skeletal description of the overarching concept, instructions for where to put my contribution and in roughly what form, and someone (from the EDGE team) listening in and replying to questions. A couple of visuals would be nice, and we do have a concept artist lined up on the Messina side. \n4. Do some pretty constant work for the following week or two. The writer(s) write(s), the EDGE & Messina teams try to drive engagement. It becomes kind of a virtual residency! \n5. Meanwhile, tentatively reschedule a physical residency for, say, May 2021. COVID allowing, that residency could then become more \"writing fiction based on the world that was developed\", and less \"building the world itself\". \n6. Between December and March we would find out how much traction this idea really has, and re-invest in it or just archive it as a fun episode. \n\nHow does that sound?

Questa \u00e8 la vera innovazione, in quanto qualunque capacit\u00e0 tecnologico matematica (o anche buraocratica nel mondo precedente a quello che volete costruire), arrivata alla sua massima espressione, deve essere ricondotta all'interazione e alla connessione fra le persone, allorquando si tratti di perseguire un obiettivo comune. Credo che la tecnologia e il free sw siano il futuro di chi pensa che al mondo si possa trovare un ruolo sociale anche senza passare attraverso le scorciatoie tipiche della nostra cultura mediterranea, facendo pesare la propria competenza e cercando chi la pu\u00f2 valorizzare, ovunque senza confini, e chi la pu\u00f2 arricchire. Ma qualunque forma di tecnologia l'uomo sar\u00e0 in grado di inventarsi per puntare al raggiungimento di concreti obiettivi con ricadute sulla socialit\u00e0 diffusa, laddove si punti a riportare alla socialit\u00e0 la ricchezza delle conoscenze personali e non a goderne solo a livello personale e in modo egoistico, dovr\u00e0 guardare a come essa impatta sul modo di relazionarsi fra le persone, a come aiuta a perseguire obiettivi collettivi condivisi e non ideoligi o finalizzati all'arricchimento o alla fama unicamente personale (di guru non se ne pu\u00f2 davvero pi\u00f9).

Thanks for joining EdgeRyders :)\n\nI've looked through your profile here but there is no link to your social media profiles or projects you're working on. Would you care to share with us some of the things you're most proud of?\n\nWhen you think about wonderful, future building initiatives in Armenia, irrespective of field (arts, labour market, migration, heath), what are those which come to your mind? They can be very small and live outside the civil society sphere, in fact that's where we're focusing on. With Spot the Future our aim is to connect with the people driving projects or testing solutions with a certain degree of risk (perhaps they don't make a living out of the project?), help them meet one another and invite them here in a conversation beyond geographic borders. Do you think you could help us reach them? How?\n\nAnother thing that I'm curious about is your feedback about the project communications so far. Example this post:\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/blog/connect-with-1800-people-working-to-make-the-world-a-better-place\n\nDo you think it's interesting, inspiring enough or would reasonate with change makers in your country? be it in English or the Armenian translated version.\n\nThanks, I think any input at this stage is super valuable, as we're building the project and we may be trying out different approaches before we find the better one.

Depicts an economy entirely based on DIY production, in the book made cheap at an arbitrarily small scale by advanced 3D printing and biotech. Production is organized like a Wikipedia-style project. The book makes the argument that reputation bookkeeping (kudos, karma etc.) invites gaming of the system, and is an inferior way to organize production to a pure gift economy (given some key abundances). It also makes the case for defection from mainstream society ([exit](https://edgeryders.eu/t/exit-vs-voice-reacting-to-decline-in-2017/7633) in Hirschman's terms) as a viable strategy when cheap, open tech is available.\n\n* _Distraction_, by Bruce Sterling. This novel focuses on politics, but the action happens against a backdrop of economic semi-collapse, where only about a third of people participate into the mainstream economy, and many of them do so by forming parts of the retinues of rich people (\"krews\"). Many people are nomads, and live on cheap-and-open tech and biotech. Nomad society is organized around \"reputation servers\" storing reputation as a currency. The book also contains a funny (but chilly) conversation in which one of the character, a car industry executive, explains why radical innovation is bad for business.\n\n* _Makers_, by Cory Doctorow. A  near-future novel centered on Schumpeterian creative destruction, as enacted by a movement called New Work. New Work is all about very small, networked business units working as independent companies within large corporates (who no longer have a viable business model, but who do have viable plumbing and cash from the good old days). These companies dream up new products, build them on top of cheap, open source components, immediately get imitated and undercut by others, and move on to the next product, surfing the wave of novelty and high margins. The movement gets eventually busted by Wall Street pulling the plug on something it does not understand. Many ideas generated in economics are floating around _Makers_ beside creative destruction: Bertrand competition, building-blocks technical innovation, Arrow's paradox and others. @alberto wrote [a complete review from the point of view of an economist](http://www.cottica.net/2010/08/30/leconomia-di-makers-di-cory-doctorowthe-economics-of-cory-doctorows-makers/).\n\n*  _Autonomous_, by Annalee Newitz. It's a far future, earth-bound scenario with advanced biotech, under a corporate rulership primarily powered by extreme intellectural property rights. She goes deep in the debate between master-servant relationships, as the world features both classic human indebted servitude and autonomous artifically intelligent robots as well as into piracy, open knowledge, addiction and freedom.\n\n* _Freedom TM_, by Daniel Suarez. Suarez imagines a market economy based on \"darknet credits\". It looks like prices of different things as denominated in darknet credits are determined by market mechanisms, but it's hard to say. The darknet economy emerges in two steps: first, a complicated scheme enacted by a weak (but very effective) AI extracts money off large financial corporations, funding the transition to the new economy (a pretty bloody one, that entails eliminating some plutocrats and violently wiping out drug cartels). Second, the fledgling economy turns out to be very efficient, because it wastes much less energy in corporate bullshit and does not care about IPRs. The critique of the inefficiencies of late capitalism is sharp enough, but there is no real explanation for _why_ the agents of the darknet economy do not become extractive and bullshitting like those of the mainstream economy.\n\n* _Webs of Varok_ (Cary Neeper, 2012).  In the book a woman from Earth is adopted into an alien family on a world which has a green, steady-state economy.  (Mild spoiler) The villain of the book is somebody who doesn't want to abide by the economic restrictions.  Dr. Neeper (PhD in Microbiology, not Economics) uses the book to envisage what a steady state economy might be like unencumbered with Earth's political history.  She posts about her sources for the economics on her website at [http://ArchivesOfVarok.com](http://ArchivesOfVarok.com).  The book interesting, but questions remain about how productivity growth (the economy of Varok devotes a large portion of is research to science) would effect the steady state economy.\n\n* _Memoirs of a Spacewoman_, by Naomi Mitchinson\n\n* _The Final Circle of Paradise_, by Strugatski Brothers\n\n* _Shockwave Rider_, by John Brunner\n\n* _The Year 200_, by Augustin de Roja\n\n* _Michaelmas_, by Algis Budrys\n\n* _The Syndic_, by C.M.Kornbluth\n\n* _The Space Merchants_, by Pohl and Kornbluth\n\n* _Down and Out in the Magic Kindgom_, by Cory Doctorow. Explores the idea of a reputation-based economy.\n\n*  _Neptunes Brood_, by Charles Stross (loose sequel to Saturn's Children and inspired by Debt: The First Five Thousand Years). \"Neptune's Brood invents an economic framework for space colonization, complete with fast, medium and slow cryptocurrencies. Because colonizing a star system is an insanely large investment that takes an insanely long time. Stross discusses his economic thinking [on his blog](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/09/crib-sheet-neptunes-brood.html).\" \n\n* _Subspace Explorers_, by E. E. Smith (\"The Principle of Enlightened Self Interest\" as the basis of an economy)\n\n* _Ring of Fire_, by Eric Flint (Unions as the basis of commonwealth)\n\n* _Centenal Cycle_ series, by Malka Olders (more political than economic but placing here for high relevance)\nBook 1: Infomocracy\nBook 2: Null States\nBook 3: State Tectonics\n\n* _New York 2140_, by Kim Stanley Robinson (The Villain: Soul-devouring stage-5 capitalism/ The Heroes: You and me/ Their Weapons: Pitchforks and mortgages/ The Dramatic Twist: An oligarch\u2019s change of heart/ The Princess: Post-capitalist utopia)\n\n* _2312_, by Kim Stanley Robinson. Set in a later epoch in the same future history as the Mars trilogy and _New York 2140_. It depicts a solar system economy,  with a fully terraformed Mars, Venus, Titan and Triton well on their way to their own  full terraforming, colonies on Mercury, Luna and other moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and plenty of hollowed out asteroids. The economy is dual. \"Space\", meaning everything except Earth and Mars, is run by the Mondragon Accord. This is a network of space settlements, which started out their economies as scientific stations (and so as planned economies). As these economies grew in size and complexity, they drew inspiration by Mondragon (\"a small Basque town that ran an economic system of nested co-ops organized for mutual support\"). The Mondragon Accord is characterized as a more sophisticated planned economy, run by quantum computers making real-time adjustments in production schedules. Markets and capitalism are still there, but they \"tended to be private unregulated individual enterprises in nonessential goods. Capitalism was in effect relegated to the margin, and the necessities of life were a shared commons exchange between Earth and individual space colonies was on a national or treaty-association basis, thus a kind of colonial model\". Earth is still run by late-stage capitalism; Mars has withdrawn from the Mondragon Accord and is described as a \"planetary social democratic economy\".\n\n\n\n* _Red Plenty_, by Francis Spufford. A mix of history and fiction, it is a sort of docudrama on the Soviet Union's 1960s attempt to upgrade its economic planning using computers and scientific methods. The main economic concept called into play is that of [shadow prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_price). These are estimates of the cost of a product or service based on the willingness to pay, that is, what the relevant economic actor is willing to give up to obtain that product or service. A group of Soviet economists attempts to reform the way the economy works: now factories are supposed to pursue a \"shadow profit\" made  by meeting their objectives while using preferentially those inputs that have a lower shadow price. The reform collides with the \"folk\" ways in which these decisions have traditionally been made, and finally fails. This book is rich in insight about the nuts-and-bolts of a deep economic reform. Also discussed in the thread below, especially [this post](/t/8582/54).\n\n* _Numbercaste_, by Yudhanjaya Wijeratne. A near-future novel where a Silicon Valley corporation replaces credit scoring with a quantification of their influence, scraped from social media. Sold with a bottom-up microservices model, the company integrates the use of this system into every customer-facing aspect of life - from restaurants to banks to nightclubs. Also examines a similar system being constructed in China but pushed using top-down methods. A key theme is how this quantification of social influence eventually cripples upward mobility (except in those who can game the system), due to children inheriting the social networks of their parents. A late-stage concept is how this 'stick' in turned into a 'carrot' - by means of an app that will now tell people who to talk to, who to mingle with, who to know based on the likelihood of it increasing their Number.\n\n* *Utopia Five*, by A. E. Currie. Depicts a post-event, capitalist surveillance economy, where surveillance data have become public record. Entrepreneurs like the main characters build profit-making applications on those data including games, search engines, social credit, and law enforcement systems. These are then operated under the constant threat of a form of nationalisation. The day-to-day operation of the world is loosely based on Cuba and its recovery from the [special period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Period) of the 1990's, which was characterised by sudden severe shortages of hydrocarbon energy sources and necessitated a complete overhaul of the country's agriculture, diet and transport. The novel is clearly influenced by the current high levels of private and state surveillance, particularly in the UK and China, and the uses to which that data is put.\n\n* _The Culture Series_, by Iain Banks. These novels are set in the far future. The economy they depict is one of [post-scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy), sustained by technologies of inconceivable power (\"[handwavium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtainium)\"). The Culture is a galactic polity whose citizens are both biological and non-biological sophonts. Humans predominate among biologicals. AIs, many of which embodied in ships, are vastly smarter and more powerful, and do most of the societal heavy lifting. The most important economic concept deployed is that a post-scarcity society which is leisure-oriented. Culture people (and AIs) focus on \"serious fun\" elaborated games, art forms, extreme sports, re-enactments of past events, and so on. In this sense, Banks is following up on the Keynes' famous 1930 essay, [Economic possibilities for our grandchildren](https://assets.aspeninstitute.org/content/uploads/files/content/upload/Intro_Session1.pdf). His contribution consists in giving an \"architect's rendering\" of what it would feel like to live in a post-scarcity world. He agrees with Keynes' strategy of boosting the arts as a way to keep people engaged and happy in a world without work.\n\n* *MetaGame*, by Sam Landstrom. It describes a world rebuilt on a more or less clean slate after a pandemic wiped out most of the population. As a new starting point, Landstrom has chosen [Mihaly Cskiszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi)'s idea of Flow. Since Flow is achieved in play, it follows that a total gamification of the economy leads to the maximally efficient outcome. For example, a minor character works (or rather \"plays\") as an operator of small robots who clean public spaces such as tunnels and hallways. To him, he is playing a game (itself a part of the economy-wide Game), where he earns points for clean surfaces, but he has to spend points to rent the robots. Points are used as the system's currency.  In a sense, this is a [Coaseian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem) world where hierarchies have no reason to exist, because the Game brokers between players' supply and demand schedules. On the other hand, he does imagine s form of collective production unit: the Great Houses, large families with thousands of members, that have replaced corporations. The author explains they grew out of civil unions, after some activists successfully fought for the right to have civil unions between more than two people. \n\n* _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, by Robert A. Heinlein. The Moon is a former penal colony, where convicted criminals have been deported and left there with a skeletal surveillance crew. Escape being all but impossible, authorities are unconcerned about what prisoners and their descendants do, as long as they keep farming grain and shipping it to an overpopulated Earth. In this situation, a free market \"Randian\" economy has evolved. Everything is purchased on the market, including health care, insurance (from bookmakers) and oxygen. The book has some an unusual attention for economic matters, but according to this editor (@alberto) its economic system is familiar (as an abstractiion) with anyone who's been through Economics 101. \n\n* *The Caryatids*, by Bruce Sterling. The world of 2060 is divided into three spheres of influence, each fighting with the others over the resources of fallen nations and an environment degraded almost to the point of no return. There is the Dispensation, centered in Los Angeles, where entertainment and capitalism have fused with the highest of high-tech. There is the Acquis, a Green-centered collective that uses invasive neurological technology to create a networked utopia (at one point the author refers to it explicitly as a system based on \"commons-based peer production\". And there is China, the sole surviving nation-state, a dinosaur that has prospered only by pitilessly pruning its own population. \n\n\nAlso see @petussing's own [list of pre-1968 works](/t/8582/79) (uncommented). \n\n### Short stories\n\n* _The Unplugged_, by Vinay Gupta.  Short story, written in 2006 and speculating about 2030. Vinay (@hexayurt on Edgeryders)  imagines a different form of saving (\"three months of salary\") as a switch towards a different \"Ricardian\" economy, underwritten by natural capital + labour. Quite some economics there, in a sense anticipating _Walkaway_ without the conflict. [Read it here](http://www.appropedia.org/The_Unplugged).\n\n* _Green Days in Brunei_, by Bruce Sterling.

[HTML](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/horatius-and-clodia/).\n\n* _The Writing Contest_, by Yudhanjaya Wijeratne. A future where ML models can easily figure out story structures and replicate entire novels and the whole entertainment market is essentially written by bots (Shakespeare 2.0 et al). The last showcase left for human writers is a writing contest. Writing as a career is no longer viable.\n\n\n## Underlying economics / philosophy\n\n*  [Capitalist Sorcery, Phillip Pignarre and Isabelle Stengers](https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230237629)\n\"This is a relatively short but potent, and highly thought-provoking book which reassesses capitalism as a \u201csystem of sorcery\u201d (40). It engages less with the labyrinths of Marxist theory than with the rhetorical attempt to persuade anti-capitalist fellow travellers and (crucially) potential neophytes, that critical and social progress consists in \u2018inheriting\u2019 Marx anew...\"\n\"Stengers and Pignarre launch call to invention, against the spell of the infernal alternatives that bind us to the capitalist 'realist' logic of choosing between the lesser of unliveable evils. To counter this capture, they propose a political 'magic' capable of creating new possibilities. But do not be misled: the 'magic' is all in the technique, and the technique is all in relation. Capitalist Sorcery is a veritable toolbox for an anticapitalist politics of collective empowerment, essential reading for all those interested in movement politics post-Seattle.\"\n_@anique.yael held a reading group on this as a part of her aforementioned reading group on radical political economics and thinks reading a selection of chapters could offer inspiration for thinking of pragmatic and creative tools within Edgeryders' as a collective._\n\n*  [The Power at the End of the Economy, Brian Massumi](https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Power-at-the-End-of-the-Economy/)\nRational self-interest is often seen as being at the heart of liberal economic theory. In The Power at the End of the Economy Brian Massumi provides an alternative explanation, arguing that neoliberalism is grounded in complex interactions between the rational and the emotional. Offering a new theory of political economy that refuses the liberal prioritization of individual choice, Massumi emphasizes the means through which an individual\u2019s affective tendencies resonate with those of others on infra-individual and transindividual levels. This nonconscious dimension of social and political events plays out in ways that defy the traditional equation between affect and the irrational. Massumi uses the Arab Spring and the Occupy Movement as examples to show how transformative action that exceeds self-interest takes place. Drawing from David Hume, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Niklas Luhmann and the field of nonconsciousness studies, Massumi urges a rethinking of the relationship between rational choice and affect, arguing for a reassessment of the role of sympathy in political and economic affairs.\n_@anique.yael worked closely with Brian as a part of my research prior to Edgeryders. While this isn't science fiction per say it's a radical speculation and generous provocation around how to reclaim our power in late capitalism._ \n\n* [Speculate This! uncertain commons](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Speculate-This/)\nSpeculate This! is a concise, provocative manifesto advocating practices of \"affirmative speculation\" over and against contemporary forms of speculation that quantify and contain risk to generate financial profit for a privileged few. This latter mode of speculation is predatory and familiar, its fallout evident in ongoing environmental degradation, in restrictive legal claims on natural resources in distant lands, and in the foreclosures, evictions, and unemployment resulting from the financial collapse of 2007\u201308. While such exploitive speculation seeks to reduce uncertainty and pin down the future, the affirmative practices championed by the authors of Speculate This! engage uncertainty, contingency, and difference, and they multiply, rather than reduce, possible futures. In these affirmative practices, social relations and the creation of goods and knowledge are not driven by the desire for financial gain or professional status. Whether manifest in open-source software, eco-communes, global activist movements, community credit networks, or experimental art, speculative living affirms our commonality. As a collaborative work coauthored by a group of anonymous scholars, Speculate This! argues for and embodies affirmative speculation.\n_@anique.yael read this as a part of a reading group leading up to a seminar with the [Economic Space Agency](https://economicspace.agency/) (with whom I continue to collaborate). It's a dynamic, fun and accessible read that offers entry into the complex world of speculative finance and our options beyond it._\n\n* [Cybernetic Revolutionaries](https://www.amazon.com/Cybernetic-Revolutionaries-Technology-Politics-Allendes/dp/0262525968?tag=ad-backfill-amzn-one-good-20), by Eden Medina\n\n* _Economic Science Fictions_, Edited by William Davies\n\n\n## Not specifically economic necessarily, but relevant sci-fi worth considering\n\n* _The Dispossessed_, by Ursula Leguin\n\"Set in the Hainish Cycle, but without a chronological relation to the other novels, The Dispossessed, takes to a conclusion the grand themes Le Guin writes about: gender politics, economics, alternative forms of social organization, socialization of knowledge, novel types of hierarchies, authority and of wielding power.\"\nSet between the two planets (or planet and moon) of Urras and Anarres. Urras is a planet on the edge of collapse under an unwieldy late-capitalism; Anarres is an anarcho-syndicalist state on a barren inhospitable moon. The story tells of a scientist from Anarres who has to travel back to the homeworld of Urras, and in the process ends up feeling isolated and disconnected from both worlds.

There are plenty of reasons to scaffold different structures that serve me and my peers better, rather than waiting for the existing institutions to come to similar positions. Once those scaffolds show other ways are viable, this then enables your Voice being heard to enact change that impacts also the existing institutions. It is Voice in a roundabout way, by proving you are not dependend on the incumbent structures and able to Exit, thus upending the power balance that favors maintaining the status quo. When I first got into Open Data / Open Gov I decided to not do lobbying or political organizing, but organize my own path for action and use the empowerment that gave me towards the same desired change. In my perspective Edgeryders itself is an example of such a hybrid too: many of the network members have Exited in various ways, yet the whole definitely engages with the incumbent structures, but might well have been Voiceless but for having formed the network.\n\nSo essentially along the lines of what @matthias says, but then without the need for a full parallel Walkaway society as alternative, just a wide portfolio of opt-outs. [quote=\"matthias, post:4, topic:7633\"]\nBut what if the walkaway solution becomes much more doable and comfortable through well developed, ready-made, open source solutions.

It seems that you have many great ideas about how to improve your local community.\n\nI have much experiene of the BID structure myself as my home town of Bedford in the UK was one of the first to adopt the structure and my father was the Director of the Board for many years before standing down last year.\n\nFrom a personal note we found that the local council/politicians were very happy to engage with and promote the work of the BID, but that it is wise to steer clear of encouraging them to run the projects. Partly this is because it is better being held in the hands of a non-party-alligned group of individuals. The main reason is that most politicians do not want to be seen to be increasing the taxation of local businesses. Because the BID system frequently\u00a0demands that local businesses pay an annual subsidy or charge, if it is administered by the city then it is automatically seen by the citizens as a stealth business tax.\n\nIt is much better for the BID groups to be politically autonomous and to save the time and energy of local politicians and civil servants.

There is a libertarian/anarchist element, such that people would be freed to set their own goals\n\nThe carrot in such a system is that everyone would get a deposit in their account, say, once a month. People would sit up and notice. The sticking point, of course, would be that much of what capitalists think they \"own\" would be nationalized or taxed. Heinlein's book skated over the transition and landed the hero in the full-fledged Utopian society, which is so 19th century and removes the conflict -- the hero just spends all his time listening as the benefits of the new system are extolled, and the creative conflict of a novel is lost. And that conflict would be useful as a way of describing what kinds of obstacles would arise and what consequences would result when moving toward this model of society.\n\nSo this means there are elements: first is how do we design the body that determines the payments? It would attract enormous pressure to set the level at a point which would be in accordance with the interests of one part of the society or another -- the rich versus the workers, of course. They would need to evaluate what the portion of overall capital represents the value of existing patented processes, plus the value of all production contributed by the land itself, which you know includes all natural resources -- this amount would then be distributed to the population. This issue would probably form the main conflict in a novel, and provide the drama. It would be too easy to arrange for \"bad capitalists, good workers\" -- less cardboard characters should be used. In the classic scifi novel the people who would resolve the conflict would be technocratic warriors -- number crunchers to the rescue! But of course in 2020 we have seen how technocracy can be undermined by subverting our faith in science in the interests of one group, and drawing in a large portion of the workers by stroking their nationalism and their religion. And technocracy itself is dangerous -- look at Kurt Vonnegut's 1952 book \"Player Piano\", as well as the British sociologist Michael Young's venture into science fiction, the 1958 \"The Rise of the Meritocracy\". If only the smartest rule, then democracy is no more, and the less smart and less well educated will resent them, as we already see in the US and Europe -- to the benefit of populists. All these obstacles must be avoided to succeed.\n\nBut then you get a society in which people really can pursue their dreams. You know Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own\"? Not scifi, but it describes the need of any creative person for a stable place and income in order to create. If I want to be an entrepreneur, I can keep at it longer without needing to have the \"right\" color face or gender or religion or nationality to receive a loan. If I want to make things, like medieval swords or works of art or fine furniture, I can do so -- this, by the way, might well be a way to overcome to some extent the problems associated with a pure technocratic rule -- skilled artisans and farmers and entrepreneurs and other producers would also have a role. One thinks of William Morris' 1890 \"News From Nowhere\".\n, \nHow to incentivize people not to be couch potatoes? This is to some extent a behavioral economics question. A significant part of modern society is depressed. Stress levels are very high. What would be the social psychological effects of dramatically reducing the society-wide levels of stress? I think very significant. There will be couch potatoes, but not nearly as many as a skeptic might worry. Inasmuch as  base \"social credit\" would be calculated from actual income from historical capital and land, this would be independent of any assessment of \"need\". But a VERY back-of-envelope calculation for the US is:\n\n2018 GDP per capita: $62,795.\nProportion of GDP contributed by labor: US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 58.4% as of 2016\nBy the way, the proportion of labor vs capital is declining over time, contributing to inequality\nCapital share is around 40%. About 40% of industries are patent intensive, so, say,24%\nThe World Bank calculates natural resources rents in the US as of 2017 at 0.7% of GDP.\nSo, say 25% of GDP is about $$16,000/yr for every man, woman and child in the USA.\nThat's enough to live on, but not well -- there would be incentive to work to produce income.", "created_at": "2020-12-05 06:27:04.470439", "updated_at": "2020-12-05 06:27:04.470439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 808, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 39.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8485, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1787, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>It does make sense, wondering about organisational process.</b>\n\n<span>To the guiding principles I would also add <strong>\"Ensure a\u00a0</strong></span><strong><span>transparent process\"</span></strong><span>\u00a0so that there is a way one could follow progress</span><span>\u00a0in building Lote\u00a0</span><span>and</span><span>\u00a0what is happening in each of the tracks.

Bear in mind, this is ruled by \"Royal Decree\". If you follow the normal process, it takes a lot of time. Total cost for creating such a corporation is around 1.500 Euro. Mainly to pay for the Notary expenses because it is still an ad-hoc process very complicated to automate and often the first application is rejected (Notaries are very careful at checking all requirements even though some of them are quite ambigous).\n\nFor the people more interested in the legal aspect, check out \"TITTRE III of Belgian Law on ASBL, AISBL and Private Foundations dated June 27th of the year 1921 (art. 46 to 58). A Private Foundation is also a potential instrument for what you are looking for.\n\nIf you go for the AISBL, you'll then have to take care of \"Fiscal Authorities Article 316\", a basic paper wherein you have to provide carefully the required information about \"principal activity\" and \"accesory activities\" in order to justify the percentage of revenues that can be considered as \"profit\". Indeed, an AISBL can make money but should describe the share of this profit compared to the total revenues.\n\nThere are some very interesting aspects of AISBL related to \"Gifts\" or \"Donations\" as described by the Belgian legislation. I would recommend that you investigate that as well. It is more interesting than the mechanism in place in Switzerland for example. An AISBL is often used to distribute money for scholarships (Bourses d'\u00e9tudes) that was received from donators. Legally speaking two diffrent kind of \"gift\" according to the Belgian legislation.

Many of the things you describe happen in the Netherlands as well. People are looking for new ways to get funding for things that are intuitively of much value but cannot be measured in terms of economic value. In our personal lifes we can perfectly cope with these situations. For example, \u00a0when we have the desire to become a parent, people don't (at least the people I know of) make a business case of how many it will costs, financially and in time, \u00a0to have a child and how that exactly relates to all the good things. We value those things, intuitively, but are not measuring it in quantitve terms.\n\nYou mentioned in your mission:\n\n\"I asked the occupants as you might quantify the social and cultural value that they are producing. They haven't even found a way that would make quantitatively the value produced, but everyone agrees that finding a way to quantify it can be useful to legitimize their illegal actions and it will probably make it even easier to request the negotiation of a new labor law and a new welfare system.\"\u00a0\n\nUntil recently I was very much convinced about the need for quantifying social value, nowadays I am hesitating. Why is it that we put calculus at the heart of almost everything if we are talking about policymaking? I can't give an answer to that question at this moment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-05 08:11:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.244202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 268, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21577, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 5791, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Mental Health Community </b>\n\nAny luck with that login?\n\nThis is the mental health network.

The brute dumbness of the hive mind is the raw food ingredients that smart design can chew on. Editorship and expertise are like vitamins for the food. You don\u2019t need much of them, just a trace even for a large body. Too much will be toxic, or just pushed away.

We\u2019ve had success in using collaborative technology in bringing health care to the poorest, developing free college textbooks, and funding drugs for uncommon diseases.

But database records are not easy to work with in a spreadsheet (no comfortable sorting and filtering by column, esp. no filters on multiple colums at the same time etc.).\n\n3. **[Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/).** You know that one :) For \"small, semi-structured databases\" of, say, <200 records, I like to use list management software like Dynalist. You can use `#tags` to have (some) filtering. Again, there is no data entry form here, so contributors have to request edit access first or post their sporadic additions in Discourse comments. If you use this variant, create a new Dynalist document for this in the left-side \"file pane\" there. It is possible, with a bit of work on our side for development, to embed a read-only version of the Dynalist document inside a Discourse topic.", "created_at": "2017-11-09 16:11:47.029273", "updated_at": "2017-11-09 16:11:47.029273", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 110.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [39210], "is_reply_to": [39210], "is_liked_by": [3904, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25427, "user_id": 3331, "topic_id": 5815, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Tears (of joy) in my eyes</b>\n\nOh, @maymay</a> you just saved my day.

I'm new to the platform, indeed. I was kindly introduced to the thread by Noemi, my dear friend.\n\nYou pointed out so well that being poor, scared and stressed out is as limiting as not practicing one's art as their profession! It\u2019s curious what makes people choose one or the other. One theory I heard recently at a sociology of arts conference was that people in these fields keep thinking that the next gig/exhibition etc. will be the big break. Costly naivety/ self-deceit \u00a0:)\n\nSo, the theory you mentioned and the article you recommended are new to me and I find they describe aspects of the arts-market relationship, amongst others, very accurately. Thank you for sharing this with me! Before reading these, I was thinking about how creative fields and other\u00a0professions, like sports, have some similar stress sources, and this was confirmed and explained by the superstar economy theory.\n\nAs useful and valid this is, I think it explains things only in part. One idea that comes to mind is the notoriously anxiety-inducing profession of writing. There seems to be something intrinsic about the creative craft that makes people doubt themselves completely. The tyranny of the white page could be well found in the white canvas \u2026\n\nBesides this intrinsic source of anxiety, which, again, I'm quite uninformed about, I see a few more layers. As you were saying, Alberto, a strong one would be the characteristics of the winner-takes-it-all labor markets, and others might hover between the two, like self-belief, identity issues etc. I imagine a tension, a dynamic.\n\nNoemi, you phrased it wonderfully talking about the pressures of \"how to carry yourself in the world\" as an artist. In particular, the fact that the distinction or the separation between art and life, professional and personal evaporate within the arts (from creators to art professionals) would be a generous source of tension.\n\nOne question that crosses my mind: how much of this is penetrating within the non-creative spheres as side-effect of the creative turn, the requirement for creativity, the curated self, etc.?\n\nBy way of conclusion -\u00a0I'm 30 now and I've been practicing self-deceit and strategic thinking, in turns, for more than\u00a05 years now. Reading your story, Alberto (thanks a lot @Noemi for the introduction, that was quite a read!), worries me\u00a0that I have some time left for at least one shift ;)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-09 21:40:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.317644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 442, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32197], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7908, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 2968, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>and here's some analytics from the Twitterstorm Dashboard </b>\n\nThe \"dashboard\" was a kind of digital flyer designed to make it easy for people to follow some instructions and \"click to tweet\" a few stock tweets intended to spread further awareness of the Twitterstorm.

After a while (not too large if you have friends, family, etc.) is becoming easier given that you learn how the system works...\u00a0\n\nGood luck in Brussels!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 22:50:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.479614", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 213, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38841, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7585, "post_number": 2, "raw": "That kind soul was me.

On the individual level the fact that the areas of tectonic activity can't be correlated with \"more sinners living there\" would hopefully take care of that.\n\nIf you have any questions I might be able to help with I'll see what I can do.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-02 10:37:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:51.642682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 282, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21743, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5581, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>agree</b>\n\nI agree with you @nadia, that's why in a public presentation here in Milano I said that these \"infrastructures\" (i.e. Airbnb) needs to be regulated not only to collect taxes but (more important) because they are quasi-monolistic operator in the market ( see for example how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terna_Group\">Terna</a> the\u00a0Italian\u00a0electricity transmission system operator\u00a0is operating in Italy)\u00a0\n\nSo: data needs to be own by the collectivity but here we're in the field of EU, economics agreement.... a mess :(\n\nThese agreement (such as the one linked by Noemi) are on a totally different level (economically, politically, ...\u00a0) and in my opinion are quasi-ok.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-05 20:52:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:01.081667", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 130, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19806], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38785, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 7578, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_[**Editor note:** The following notes were made by @lucian  during the \"Policy redesigned\", of OpenVillage Festival (19th October 2017).

One thing is that civic awareness is increasing a lot. When I started working in Milan, it was top down, but now tensions are growing. In Milan we started a crowdfunding: 1300 became donors. They accepted to be engaged. They want a dialog with the public administration. And they aren\u2019t used to that. We didn\u2019t at first know how to manage that, to speak to citizens in a rational way, as a productive practice. \n\nSomething else, public policy, especially top down is very dangerous. In these days, you talk about regenerating suburbs -- it is a public emergency. In the 60s, there were big blocks, without shared spaces, this approach was not public-centric. \n\nThird, traditional political parties can\u2019t afford a top-down approach, they have no future if they can\u2019t talk to people. Civic movements will replace them. Like in Turin & Milan, they are ruled by civic movements. If they want to survive, they are obliged now, to change their approach\u2026.\n\nOur spinoff of OpenCare, is called Open Rampette this is a use case.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Matteo]\n\n_(City Council Member, Milan)_\n\nOpen Rampette is the spinoff of Open Care and is funded by Horizon 2020. We are publically funded. OpenCare is about the research that put together the collective intelligence\u2026. We Make [a local makerspace] & Milan partnered together to talk with the community. Our scope was to figure out what was working, what wasn\u2019t, and what was promising. We co-designed, and used the brain of makers in that process of co-designing. \n\nWe focused on Article 77. The problem here is that regulation was designed without consensus or consulting the community. The office that designed it, didn\u2019t talk to the constituency, and other offices. There was a 10% compliance rate, which is practically a failure. The way to enforce.\n\nWe started thinking about how to rewire, This group put together a strategy for co-designing. And started to look for why people weren\u2019t complying. [See mapping for stats]. In my opinion, we still thought that we were thinking top-down. We deconstructed the policy to figure out the bugs in the policy.\n\nThis was the first step _[missing notes]_\nThe 3rd step was co-design session to find solutions, and to possibly fix it. We were ready to go back to the city council, and to talk with them if the solution we provided was implemented, if it was replicable & scaleable.\n \n [/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Constantino]\n (We Make, La Rampette): So I set up this mess to have Francesco join us. \n\n [/quote]\n\n\n[quote=RK]\nIs this being recorded?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Constantino]\n\nYes _[Francesco appears on projection and shows us slide in Italian, bc of the local population.]_\n\nWe are trying to going from the very specific to a more general solution. What is very interesting, we at We Make, you can build products and stuff. The first idea we had was to actually produce custom ramps. But this wasn\u2019t the main point. It was fast prototyping, how it can be applied to fast policy. The open care project allowed us to _[missing]..._\n\nTo me, this not a failure. The online platform needs to bring\u2026. We created two roles to impersonate the shop owner and a person who wants to enter the shop. We frame the \u2026 _[missing]_\n\n\u2018La procedura\u2019 is the bureaucracy. \u2018La chiamata\u2019 is the moment in the user experience in which the user rings a bell for the shop owner to open the ramp. The rule in Milan now is that the buildings need to be accessible, fullstop. These rules say that if the building isn\u2019t under renovation, that they need to have at least have a temporary ramp, like an aluminum one. To call this ramp, you must ring the bell. \n\nWe went into the process of meetings, in the neighborhood, touching base with all the local associations. The meetings were from 7-9pm, so we offered a drink to the participants. You can go through the pictures on Flickr. They were held at a community center, near to a garden, where many people go to with the their children. \n\n\u2018La Chiamata\u2019- is the user experience of the call. We went through different scenarios [of the user]. We found that a temporary ramp was not the best solution. But right now, we need to cope with this. We need to improve this. 2nd, we need a physical [missing] \u2026 We analyzed the comments from post-its, etc. then came up with a process. \u2018Campanello\u2019- a bell near the entrance, and we designed some technology with bluetooth. And feedback. The little rope was to experiment if there were other kinds of physical interfaces. We created these 4 sub-prototypes, including the stickers. \n\nAn IoT object, was protoyped using arduino, and cheap components and we are working on the documentations on Instructables. \n\nThe other part of the prototyping was part of the material, information architecture, the graphic design of the PDF [documents]. Many of the competencies could be transferred from the physical to non-physical. \n\nWe did user research, and created interactive prototypes of mockups. There is a checkbox, a little calculation that the shop owner needs to make for the slope. This process is a lot, and may be a lot for each procedure, but this is something that shows what can be done. \n\nTo show that you are compliant, we created a sticker that was visible. In these few[?] months, we met 3 different challenges [missing]....\n\nBeing focused, you can be scientific, instead of talking in an abstract way, you can talk in a very practical way, and can introduce facts into the conversation. _[Nadia interjects saying no more \u2018presentation\u2019 time]_\n\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Francesco]\n\n_[Audio from Francesco brought in] Matteo translating Francesco (a user tester)_\n\n\nHe was eager to join rampette\u2026\u2019The restart from bottom up is revolutionary. Not even the association that helps the handicapped deals with this kind of process. What was amazing that the reps for disabled were able to add on a cultural level, not just technical level. This is important, that the reailer in Milan has enthusiastically joined the program. From one side, the techical\u2026 on the other side, open rampette, makes it possible for those without limbs to activate the bell. This is the next step, I hope that it makes it possible for a universal shopping experience. Also, we hope that there will be a smarter interface.\u2019\n[/quote]\n\n\n###Questions and answers\n\n**Article 77**\n\nProblem with Au Quai (where we are at present):\nFrancesco (from Milan) could have been invited, but it was not accessible\n \n\u201cThink about the new consumers if it is accessible\u201d \nReputation effects.\nMilan council: different districts have different reputations.\n\nRecruiting: went through associations\nAccessibility not just an issue for the disabled, also e.g. parents with strollers\n\n_**Q: Was there resistance in the different departments?**_\n\nThe policy was clearly top-down, designed without consulting audience. New buildings respond to universal accessibility. Defensive attitude in drafting the appilication of the policy. Convened meetings bring sides together to discuss language etc.\n\nChallenge about competences: if engineers wrote policies, they are not skilled in service design. Team is trying to foster and hybridise competences.\nDepartments are silos.\n\n[quote=albertorey]\nhow do you get people to comply for old buildings?\n[/quote]\n\nIsola district is limited part of the city, good compliance\nIntention within the project does not include scaling up for city policy\nLaw applies only to shops on the ground floor.\n\nThey try to be transparent in the design process.\nNeeded to simplify and focus collaboration with the user.\n\n\n[quote=albertorey]\n_**Do others have experience of blending roles?**_\n[/quote]\n\n_**Community research, theory of commons \u2026 Barriers between people. How can the rampette be considered a public good, as street lighting is already? Prototyping the policy is the challenge. Related to participatory action research?**_\n\n[quote=Nadia]\nFavourite public art pieces: \u201ccapitalism works for me\u201d buttons one was yes one was no, in public space, press buttons. Another methodology from Dutch \u201cKennisland\u201d(?) putting the research where people are.\n\n[quote=albertorey]\nGetting as much feedback as possible is good. Paper or digital survey to take away. \n\nBringing local people into the design process. Go from the particular case to the general case. Online community building shared knowledge.\n_**Bridging between case studies for particular issues and scaling or scaling up?**_\n\n\n_**What general things have we learned about top-down policies?**_\n\n[/quote]\n\nTried a participatory approach for e.g. sharing economy. Started from draft document on Google Drive. Invited people to modify and comment the document. Final document was approved by the city council. Less nice: participation of 250 people in a city of over a million inhabitants. It was made as easy as possible, but many challenges.\nVery relevant for the Edgeryder community.\n\nAlso important to pre-design the participation process. Should be developed through the process itself. No one method of participation that works in every situation.\n\n* Unpredictable.\n* Multiple factors \n* Need to be able to change the approach.\n\nRedesigning playgrounds of schools \u2026 difficult to communicate \u2026 e.g. sharing photos was too boring. They just went out to play, and tried things out. Threw out preconceived ideas and just watched them playing.\n\nReferenda cost millions of Euro.", "created_at": "2017-10-26 23:18:23.184869", "updated_at": "2017-10-31 23:34:06.193331", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1637, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 968, "user_id": 522, "topic_id": 935, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52b2be658a14a4d3d6bb4ccee6fc2356aa46d193.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\">\n\n<strong>Conference news:</strong> One month left and we are busy bees!!\u00a0Do you want to be one of us and work so we can make the magic happen?

The most read and commented mission report of this week is \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/making-living-edge-jon-bounds\" target=\"_blank\">Making a Living on the Edge: Jon Bounds</a>\" by <em>Cataspanglish.\u00a0</em>\n\n<blockquote>\"Jon Bounds\u00a0is without doubt one of the most creative people I have ever met\"</blockquote>\n\nAre you one of the 100+ participants on the conference?

For example, we already see conversation for actions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u00a0taking at least two forms: A. for understanding &amp; sharing info (most opencare stories) and B. \u00a0for doing things together (OpenInsulin collaboration; Collaborative scientific paper writing).</li>\n\n<li>other classifications we explored previously: A. Sharing a story [of open care] | B. Online conversation aimed at processing information; C.\u00a0Online conversation aimed at common action</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nEzio mentioned that in the ecosystem of opencare these \"events\" (to use the language from the abstract) will be \"living entities\" evolving on a continuum, they are fluid, as he <a href=\"/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/50\">explained previously here</a>, and at any moment in time we can only have captures of those actions. They can change, and change is\u00a0dynamic.\n\nEmergence seems like a good concept to explain\u00a0this change, thanks for pointing it out Alberto.\n\nSo while our analysis for the existing data will have ex-post\u00a0criteria, the way we develop this should explain emergent actions. At least this is how it is in my head right now, someone confirm or refute please :-)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-08 09:51:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.175502", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 257, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23936], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12729, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6290, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Yep, proceed here.</b>\n\nYes @Shajara I think it would be best to document the work here.

The way Denmark works \u201cflexicurity\u201d it is by trying to keep them in the employment market, not the job market, focusing on flexibility of hiring and firing, coupled with activation policies to maintain job search incentives of the unemployed.

people think of the status quo as 'normal' and don't see that it already has a political dimension, so attempts to disrupt the massively wasteful insurance/medical cartel [as Obamacare made some small steps to do] come up against lots of resistance even from people who might benefit from change.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-19 18:19:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.659603", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 134, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46236, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8534, "post_number": 59, "raw": "Mail sent..but the auto reply says he is on holiday through July 14 and to write back then.", "created_at": "2018-07-11 15:11:54.257687", "updated_at": "2018-07-11 15:15:23.239662", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 29.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [46232], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26630, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 5853, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>In the USA all healthcare is political</b>\n\n\"Obamacare\" is arguably the number one political debate along with immigration and national security.\n\nAnother aspect is student loans. \u00a0For years students have taken out loans to attend universities. \u00a0For years the government set low interest rates and wasn't aggressive in going after delinquent accounts. \u00a0That changed some years ago and those loans are now both very expensive and likely to scar your entire working life if you don't pay them on time. \u00a0I submit that is has a chilling effect on people seeking careers in medicine and health care at the higher levels. \u00a0And it is certainly a huge reason why there is such a shortage of general practitioners compared to specialists. \u00a0A GP has to take many more years to pay off their student debt.\n\nI could go on and on. \u00a0But the point is that it is impossible to separate health care from the political debate in the US, and probaly everywhere else.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-19 17:17:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.483691", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 180, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39846, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7774, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-12-01 12:34:34", "updated_at": "2017-12-01 12:38:16.099473", "deleted_at": "2017-12-01 14:33:30.995152", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 638, "user_id": 2762, "topic_id": 605, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section rtecenter\"><span><strong>Egyptian Abilities \u00a0</strong></span></h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>Idea:</strong></h3>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><span>Creating Hub for recruiting and training the Handicapped.</span></h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>previews work:</strong></h3>\n\n<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">The First Handicapped festival (Participate and Connect) in the Opera House , Cairo at Al Meidan Theater Powered by Egyptian Abilities initiative.</code>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong><span>link\u00a0</span>Event on Face Book:</strong></h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/601084940017622/\">https://www.facebook.com/events/601084940017622/</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>Documented Video for the Day:</strong></h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/adel.eissa2/videos/10204421331206909/\">https://www.facebook.com/adel.eissa2/videos/10204421331206909/ </a>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3695d04e8e2149c5fba1cf9d9a968bccc6e4a9e.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nFB page:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EgyptianAbilities\">https://www.facebook.com/EgyptianAbilities</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-27 03:28:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:01.956177", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 219, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29375, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 5853, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>But with so many refugees now</b>\n\nplacing increased demands on health care -

This campaigns (with related stickers on the walls of the cities) have connected the organizations of these celebrations with the Mafia system, how also demonstrated by important tvs and newspapers.

At LOTE4, there is a real danger of the unMonastery building becoming a place to crash \u2013 and as such, unrespected, unclean, generic, exploited for hot water and toilets but not\u00a0<em>stewarded.</em>\n\nSolution: move in 3-4 unMonasterians. They will move as people who know what to do: naturally, newcomers will refer to them and imitate them. <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>\u00a0had the idea to advertise this as \"unMonastery Lite\": you are not just going to a hackathon (I suggest we prioritise hackathon participants in allocating beds in the unMonastery) and crashing somewhere because it is cheaper, you are joining the only unMonastery on Earth, albeit for a short time. That means \u2013 at least in part \u2013 living according to Protocol. True, we don't have Protocol 1.0 yet, but we do have candidate \"lines of code\": the 7 am bell, kitchen duty, zero waste... this is enough structure for a week. The names of Masters of the House\u00a0<a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>\u00a0were floated.\u00a0\n\nI would also really welcome an unMonastery Summit session. It is a great opportunity to catch up on what people are doing. Of course we could improvise it on the fly, but this stuff has drawing power and can help us make this initiative a success. Ben, you are the most credible candidate for initiating this. Edgeryders will be behind it, of course.\n\nWhat does everyone think?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-17 09:16:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:19.896042", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10849, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3291, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Better change your current profile?</b>\n\nHi Kira and welcome !

The players keep reflecting and acting upon \"real\" city conditions, and watch the outcome of their decisions unfold on the game board.\n\nReversing Monopoly, the role-playing social game Polypolis entails negotiations among 4 groups of players that strive to resolve complex issues. The four groups of players are:\n\n<strong>1. Investors.</strong> Sub-groups: bankers, private investors, institutions/organisations, international corporations, real-estate.\u00a0\n\n<strong>2. Land/property owners</strong>. Sub-groups: big-scale ownership, small-scale ownership (local owners), small-scale ownership (owners from other areas).\n\n<strong>3. Shop/small-scale manufacture owners.</strong> Sub-groups: Greeks, Chinese, Pakistani, Greek small-scale manufacture owners, arts &amp; crafts\n\n<strong>4. Unemployed</strong>. Sub-groups: homeless, immigrants, drug-users, skilled ex-employees\n\n<strong>The winner</strong>: The group that proves the ability to resolve problems by discussion, negotiation and collaboration, managing the city resources and creating an appropriate, good quality and viable proposal for tackling the complex problems and contributing to the development of the Gerani area.\n\nSARCHA has started to develop local adaptations of the Polypolis such as the ones in Rome and in Thessaloniki. The next big event is in London in June as\u00a0part of the\u00a0London Festival of Architecture. In an 2 hour game players will become Athenians and experience a city in crisis.\n\nFor more information about Polypolis Athens in London you can visit www.polypolis.sarcha.gr\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-21 12:09:44", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 05:22:00.596125", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 375, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 80.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25596, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5880, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>What are obsolete comments?</b>\n\nI may have missed the point..

I think you make a valid point when you talk about the feeling of uncertainty that characterises our generation. I personally think it comes down to the fact that our generation - after so many that thought they knew exactly how the world should work according to definite political ideologies - is the first one to have experienced the 'end of history', and at the same time the utter failure of all systems that were imagined and implemented in the past. It's a deep philosophical question, which expresses itself, however, in very real emotions in many of us. This sense of wanting to do something and at the same time not knowing exactly what or how is precisely what can be called the \"transition\" we are trying to address here on Edgeryders.\n\nOne question to you though: you say that going abroad felt eventually like a bit of a waste of time, and that you should perhaps have pursued a career at home. Is there nothing you feel you gained from being immersed in a different culture? I think this is important to investigate, as the given mantra is that spending time abroad is in general a good thing, but perhaps there are aspects that are not so positive and that need exploration...\n\nA.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-21 21:32:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.378183", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 234, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27827, "user_id": 3630, "topic_id": 542, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Presentation</b>\n\nAfter 4 days of work we presented our project.

I started from a small wood stove that I got as a gift. Placed it 20 cm from walls to prevent any danger from the heat (sheet metal heatshields with 20 mm air gap to the walls still to be added ...).\n\nMounting for offroad driving conditions was kind of a challenge. So first I created a steel band, from 2.5 mm steel sheet metal ripped from a dead road roller's roof. It is mounted around the top of the stove, then bolted with two big bolts right through the box body wall of the truck, and has a L-profile cross-section behind the stove for reinforcement (not pictured). Two feet of the stove are bolted to the metal socket in the right of the image. Appears really solid now, and has the advantage that I can store objects uninhibited by mounting beams etc. to the left of the stove.\n\nThe wall duct through the 10 cm wall is done with a large hole, covered in blue aluminum in the image, stuffed around the oven tube with rockwool for heat protection. At the outside, there are 2 pieces of 1 m oven tubes, with one special feature as per a friend's idea: the upper tube is detached when driving, and then slides behind the lower one into a metal box  storage casing. Its top lid then fits as a rain protection lid on that storage box, level with the box body roof.\n\nPhew ... it was important that I got this done before the winter :P I'll add a diesel based independent vehicle heating some day, but for the first time, this is enough already. And, above all, it's free.

The original idea was to tell people how long after the best-before date a food item is still edible, but that was rather too simplistic as it cannot take into account different conditions of storage and pure chance of something having mold spores on it (and becoming moldy) or not.\n\nIf you have an Android device at hand, you can [install the app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fairdirect.foodrescue) and test it. The basic functionality and content is there in both English and German, but it's not too useful right now because it needs to know about more products and be fed with more content about food assessment etc.. Still, it will recognize about every third product from its barcode in Germany \u2013 and where not, people can also search tips by food category.\n\nAlso, the software works completely offline, not needing the Internet at all, because it has a database of 400,000 barcodes and categories of food items on the device. (I think I like this aspect the most, because it is very much against the trend of making everything depend on the Net and sending user data to all kinds of servers.)\n\nSo I'd say it's a solid basis that deserves quite some refinement now :)", "created_at": "2020-09-23 18:23:55.089400", "updated_at": "2020-09-23 19:15:18.111530", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 280, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 52.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [83627], "is_reply_to": [83627], "is_liked_by": [2915, 1877, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5971, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5938, "post_number": 1, "raw": "[ This is for @Amelia ]\u00a0\n\nAmelia, we are here with @melancon and @Jason_Vallet hacking away at the semantic graph.

Part of what makes this possible is distributed coordination between many individuals in different parts of the world collaborating on the online platform.\n\nIn learning to work together in this distributed way, we are building our capacity to get meaningful and ambitious things done. With new tools like Makerfox, and practices we develop through building LOTE events, we can unleash a lot of mutual support in developing community members\u2019 individual projects.\n\nIt\u2019s also why we don\u2019t charge for LOTE events in money, but in collaboration.\n\nOn an individual level participants develop new knowledge, skills and practices that are key to thriving in difficult environments. These skills are starting to be valued on the market. Over the past year we have seen signs of more <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-lbg/351-one-year-checkpoint\">organisations wishing to invest resources into collaborating with Edgeryders</a> on interesting projects. This is great news as it potentially means more paid work coming our way.\n\nIf you would like this community to realise more initiatives with the ambition and scale of the unMonastery, consider taking on a bigger role. Especially if at individual level we want to be eligible for future paid work, more of us need to develop the sought after skill and practices. Edgeryders is offering training to community members who take on team coordination roles for lote4, in addition to the \\#lote4 ticket for fullfilling the role.\n\nTo learn more about what coordination involves, <a href=\"/task-3609\">read the task description</a>\u00a0and follow the instructions there,\u00a0or join the next <a href=\"/events\">community call.</a>\u00a0In doubt?

Initial rough ideas for a project, for example, are best discussed in writing. Once a consensus has been reached on what to do, you might need a hangout for everyone to sign off to their part of the work; then people go back to writing. This has the advantage of openness (people that were not at the meeting can jump in and contribute); transparency (shows we have nothing to hide, and this generates trust, exactly what you are trying to build), and it is also much tidier. Remember: meetings, even online meetings, are devices of exclusion.

The method we will use is to limit our analysis to a smaller range of topics, allowing us to drill deep into them in a more sustained and continuous way and involve a wider demographic of participants. \n\nThe report will have a 3 part structure:\n\n1. An overview on the themes that have emerged on the platform so far, and your analysis of these themes. You are encouraged to use Graph Ryder screenshots for this section to illustrate the concepts and how they've connected so far. (see the NGI report as a possible model). Filtering the graph to 4 or 5 co-occurrences using the wheel at the top right corner is the easiest way to do this. \n\n2. A description of the narrowly focused topic areas that you would like to focus ethnographic attention on for the rest of the project, based upon the first round of coding. \n\n3. What themes, questions, and/or relationships you are hoping to explore in more depth through these more narrowly focused topic areas. \n\nPlease give us a deadline for when you will complete this -- as soon as possible, since it has major effects on what the Community Management/Outreach and Engagement teams plan for the rest of the project. @nadia and @noemi, heads up that this is incoming and will be very focused on specific topics that you can focus on on going forward. \n\n\n# Exceptional Call \n\nTo finish the code review of the spreadsheet, we will have an extra call next week, at 8:30 USA Eastern, 1:30 UK, and 2:30 Prague/Warsaw. \n\nPrior to the call, we will be having a call on Graphryder updates (time TBD) and @jan will send @amelia his reflection on parent-child relations.  \n\nAll of our calls will take place on Zoom, at this link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89020808871?pwd=OUFZMSt6N0ZEUWI2a2RhNnZXcmNzZz09\n\n# General Notes \nFeel free to use these to help write your reports -- they are your words from the call, as best as I could note them down!\n\n## Polish Forum Update\n@Wojt reports that the Polish forum has generated discussion around the main themes of institutional failure and a general lack of support. Not many people feel they lead a decent life. People experience a lot of daily struggles: with healthcare, and with inadequate income, with housing. \n\nPeople talk about the need to engage in dialogue and civilised debate, expressing a feeling that there is too much hate, a lack of solidarity, and a collapse of a sense of community. \n\nThere is also a noted divide between big and provincial cities, \"Poland A\" and \"Poland B.\" These divides are cultural and economic, and deeply felt. The failure of the state is a recurrent topic, via discussions of political inaction, institutional failure, and the destructiveness of neoliberal capitalism. \n\nLGBT rights are another key issue, clashing with traditional values. @Jan is interested in exploring the connection between anti-intellectualism and mythologies around gender ideology (and anti-LGBT sentiment). \n\n## Czech Forum Update \n\n@Jirka_Kocian expresses that the main themes emerging in the Czech forum are around healthcare, housing, and climate change. These are discussed in terms of intersocial relations and politics as they are expressed through everyday life. \n\nParticipants express problems with predatory behaviour from political elites to the state. There is a question of what the analogy might be to the system as a whole -- its antisocial nature. Whether this is a representational problem of society or a measure of something broken. \n\nMost participants on the platform are \"coffeeshop intellectuals\", between 25-35 years of age, residing in major cities like Bruno and Prague. \n\nThey articulate a divide between sticking to the liberal narrative (and opposing populism) or calling for complete alternatives. They express open association with the green parties, or at least a sympathy with them. \n\n@SZdenek thinks that some deeper conversation could be generated around the figure of the Prime Minster, who is the 2nd richest person in the Czech Republic. His media representation is also interesting. \n\nCOVID-19 is a major topic that he feels could generate deeper conversation and be a platform that brings in a diverse crowd. Through this a lot of topics could be approached:\n- **gender**, via work patterns, educaiton, leisure time, and a division of labour that is having to be negotiated/brings existing disparities to the fore, as childcare falls upon women much more. \n- **housing**, including intergenerational relations  \n- **healthcare** - access and inequality, reflections on the system and its relation to politics  \n- **anti-LGBT sentiment and relationship to ethnic minorities and refugees** - via scapegoating, etc. can also approach this via **anti-intellectualism** \u2014 particularly in the covid setting, around relationships to covid (e.g. is it a government/elite play for power or a legitimate public health issue) \n\nThis was widely agreed upon as a good approach for all the language fora. The theory being that people\u2019s responses to covid \u2014 its effects on existing systems and practices, and what it tells us about those systems and practices in the first place\u2014  and the way they frame those politically will shed light on the \u2018shadow of populism\u2019 in each country. And having the topics be largely the same across countries creates a good comparative.", "created_at": "2020-10-09 14:38:15.956763", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 12:02:35.621684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 939, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 68.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 6484, 4793, 4794], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12903, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 5975, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>My interest would be</b>\n\na couple of things.\n\nOne is high level community management - e.g. how to teach community managers to engage with people more effectively.\n\nBut I am also interested in the general phenomenon as I've worked with with percolation and networks a bit.

I have committed to do business development, fundraising and outreach for a series of Harmonious Hackathons next year and welcome 1-2 more people\u00a0 to join the core team. I would especially welcome help with the tech coordination (especially the requirements engineering bits).\n\nI believe it makes sense to start by learning from the experience: If you can answer three questions that would be very helpful.\n\n1) Would you be up for participating again and if yes, when would be a good place and time of the year for you?\n\n2) Which things did you think we got right and which ones could do with a lot more improvement in your opinion?\n\n3) Would you be interested in contributing to organising a harmonious hackathon and if so around what task/project/theme?\n\nThanks!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-10 17:02:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.578654", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 291, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 475.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1267, "user_id": 290, "topic_id": 1234, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I am 27 years old.

We love the CCC community, and feel we have much to learn from it.\u00a0\n\nHowever, 32C3 was already oversubscribed, and for this year the CCC team has taken measures to ration the tickets. We are certainly not central to their community, so we got in the queue like everybody else, \u00a0but tickets sold out before we could purchase them. No 33C3 for us. :-(\n\nWe are sorry but we fully appreciate the need for CCC to avoid overcrowding. We would also appreciate it if someone could advise us on how to work with them so that we can help a bit, and by making ourselves useful gain better access to 34C3 (and perhaps the Chaos Communication Camp) in 2017.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-25 12:02:19", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 19:01:46.890229", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 234, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24254, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5981, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Open call =&gt; win</b>\n\nI really like the idea.

When I came to Bucharest, initially, it was because I wanted to launch my startup, a project in the collaborative economy (you can read more about it <a href=\"/t/we-are-all-together-working-slowly-but-surely-for-a-new-paradigm-we-just-need-vision-patience-perseverance-and-collaboration/4125\">here</a>), and I could not afford to be an entrepreneur without pay in Paris. So I perceived my coming back initially as a sacrifice.\n\nThe situation has been really surprising, as I realized that Bucharest has changed so much, that it became a new Berlin, with so many alternative initiatives, hipster life and freedom.

If yes, do these fall under direct or indirect costs?</li>\n\n<li>How can we best go about covering the travel costs for a lot of people not officially on the research team without risking breaching the grant agreement?

This incorporates the project's online conversation layer, as well as the sensemaking on care issues and the collective decision on which problem/solution pairs to prototype.</li>\n\n<li>WP2: Prototyping community-based care solutions. WP leader: WeMake. The prototyping layer, plus testing and documentation activities.</li>\n\n<li>WP3: Design and evaluation of community-based health/social policies at scale. WP leader: Stockholm School of Economics. Self-explanatory. Includes inputs from service design discipline.</li>\n\n<li>WP4: Data processing for aggregating collective intelligence processes. Methods and software to combine ethnographic data with data on interaction patterns to help synthetize and validate the results from large-scale online conversations. WP leader: LABRI.\n\n<span>Needs decision</span>!\u00a0<em>Alternative naming based on WP activities sheet: \"</em>Survey, analyze and feedback community activities\"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere are a couple of decisions to make here. One is whether we should not give ethical issues the dignity of WP. Advantages: symmetry, with SCIMpulse leading its own WP; and signaling that we take ethics very seriously. Disadvantage: project fragmentation and loss of interdisciplinarity. As it is now, we are forced to integrate SCIMpulse at least in WP1, WP2 and WP3. <a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>, can you give us your opinion?\n\nThe other decision is how to treat WP0\u00a0<s>WP5</s>. There are two possibilities:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>all partners are involved in WP5 \u2013 that is, they have person-months budgeted under WP5.</li>\n\n<li>WP5 is run exclusively by KITE. The administrative work that partners need to do is budgeted within WP1 to 4.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSolution 2 has the advantage that\u00a0 WP5 becomes smaller. But that can be tricky too: the Commission obviously prefers to fund research rather than administration, but then it does demand lots of paperwork. The choice here depends a lot on KITE's style of work.

I disagree with your solution, though, even if it were technically realistic.\u00a0Dictation software would just take a \"snapshot\" of what people say as they say it. This would make for unreadable material: lots of \"ehms\" and \"ahs\", sentences that do not close, missing body language (like nodding when others speak).\u00a0\n\nThe act of writing contains editorialisation. It is a real transcoding from one medium (speech) to another (writing), not just a copy-paste. Ethnographers know this well: they are used to working with recordings.\u00a0By insisting on natively online conversation, we crowsdource the editorialisation, and that saves\u00a0<em>a lot</em>\u00a0of researcher time. Additionally, it empowers the participant, who takes control of the medium in which her content will be consumed by others. Chances of being misunderstood or misrepresented go way down. For example, if I say something with a light-hearted mood to a journalist in an interview, I trust that person with putting my light-hearted remark in the right context, and not making it sound like a serious one. But if I am blogging, \u00a0I can take care of that myself. I can also censor myself. And, believe me, I do.\u00a0\n\nSo, no microphones in the room.

Maybe best managed by a (paid) space organizer?</b>\n\nAs a cautious estimate of the economics of this kind of space, I think Alberto's numbers are realistic. So the risk for Edgeryders as a company is small enough, and it allows to organize things differently in practice to utilize the space to full potential both economically and as a \"Reef Space\".\n\nFor example, the use as event space, co-working space and \"AirBnB guesthouse\" could be managed in a way that is both fluid (on-demand use of multi-purpose spaces) and efficient. For efficieny, an internal web-connected booking system comes to mind, and a person who would both be Edgeryders' office manager and \"live-in space manager\", managing both marketing and bookings for the space, preparation of the space for events, guests etc., and maintenance and repair tasks. In return, they get free accommodation in the space, and free use of spaces that are not booked for other purposes. With the right incentives and the right person in charge, that could perhaps double the income from coworking space, event space and AirBnB bookings?\n\nWhat I don't really like, but that is a personal preference you all know, is that it's a very urban, central, classy space, and thus also very costly (viable, but costly). It will not be accessible for events etc. to people on shoestring budgets.

Museums are both a specific traditional 'technology' and an emerging set of disruptive institutes (or constitutes) that could be a massively powerful resource for sustainable resilience. Museums have been shifting from being storehouses of stuff (with added 'temple' aura to attract visitors) to being safe, neutral fora for dialogue and cathartic/aesthetic encounters that help us make sense of the world. Museum management is going in two directions: 1. Adding more and more expensive bricks and mortar, and attracting more corporate sponsorship and affluent tourist dollars to sustain themselves. \u00a02. Being resilient, reinventing themselves, using digital channels, involving communities to sustain both the museum and the community. The second is more a mode of thinking showing itself in some strands of museum programmes, or some professional networks. However, you can see it in some types of museums, such as rural museums or craft museums (such as the Economusems in Canada &amp; Scandinavia). They are much less about conserving memory and aiding retrieval of it, than about aiding construction of contextual understanding so that we can solve our contemporary problems. They are potentially the ideal public cultural space for the Transition.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-28 08:50:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:37.926618", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8672, "user_id": 3185, "topic_id": 6045, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>:-)</b>\n\nThanks Moushira, Costantino, Alessandro and all People that contribute @ InPe'!!!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-20 20:03:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.219797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3069, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66825, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 12069, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[quote=\"noemi, post:7, topic:12069\"]\nRealistically, that would be spring 2020\n[/quote]\n\nWe should discuss that, me you and @TamaraVuk and see what can be done and when.", "created_at": "2019-12-03 20:38:35.547964", "updated_at": "2019-12-03 20:38:35.547964", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [66818], "is_reply_to": [66818], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21057, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 6047, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Makes sense to me</b>\n\nI've been lurking on this all Christmas thinking about it.\n\nIt seems a very sensible option, especially in the short-medium term. I expect that other parts of the Reef will bring with them different challenges (construction, location, equipment) especially to create the medium and larger iterations. A small scale version in a city that is already known to a lot of partners could be a solid start. The big 'new' area for development would be the building/space manager, developing the links with organisations and individuals to sell work space, live/work space and event spaces. That outreach and expansion would probably have benefit if it happened before, or at the same time as, other reefs are being built.\n\nThe space manager is (i suppose) an extension of the Community manager position, making people welcome in a real world space.\n\nI agree in part with some of @Matthias concerns about the city centre location, but not the point about accessibility for people on shoestring budgets. Being in a city makes it easy to organise and use car sharing services, buses, trains or low cost airlines. It also makes the Reef more accessible to non-European partners who may want to visit due to it's proximity to International airports. Certainly more accessible than a rural location. My view would be city first, rural second (but very soon after)\n\nWhatever happens i'm interested.

Maybe to allow for flexibility, give the manager a cut on booking revenue, rather than a salary.\n\nTo me, the less money changing hands, the better.\n\nWhere I live we don't have any cheap accommodation, and that's a drawback for events.

I have been truly buried in work, and my life got heavily disrupted by personal matters for a couple months.\n\n@rune\n\nI think we have some miscommunication here. I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.\n\nOn your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \u00a0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper \"Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses\" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.\n\nThere are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM\n\nBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request. I'm not here to inflate the claims, and honestly I prefer to let Marie do the talking about these subject because her patient viewpoint is balanced and essential. However, I'm happy to provide more reading and evidence, when time permits.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-09 08:26:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.878254", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 360, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50001, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6047, "post_number": 31, "raw": "We got turned down with that space, but... \n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/growing-the-reef-in-brussels-some-initial-thoughts-on-sustainability/8930", "created_at": "2019-01-09 22:24:01.945784", "updated_at": "2019-01-09 22:24:01.945784", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 42.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [46636], "is_reply_to": [49980], "is_liked_by": [3206], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11937, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6379, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Re: open data</b>\n\nThat's a valid point @Rachel . Although I am a big fan of documentation, I have personally not given it too much thought for OI. Partly because the group in Oakland took the approach of not having an open and rolling documentation repository. Partly because it seemed like too big an effort for now, when\u00a0we are already struggling with managing all the information we do and don't have.\n\nI am also reminded of an interesting aspect of openness. A researcher I know, has a huge dataset on barefoot walking by indigenous communities. The Nikes of this world would pay big cash to have it. She believes in open source, however, opening up the dataset would mean only the Nikes could really exploit the data,\u00a0thanks\u00a0to their size. Smaller companies can't do much with the\u00a0data (they don't have eg. the $10,000 3D printer for it) and the indigenous communities can't either. There is skewness in the situation: a huge relative difference in resources, a huge financial incentive and no community of peers that is in a position to contribute to the commons. For all good measure, opening up the data would be\u00a0closer to a transaction (a gift, even).\n\nThe same factors are at play\u00a0for Open Insulin. If at one point, an experiment proves promising, a biotech company could take it from there and easily be faster. The peers (like the Belgium group) who want to contribute, can contribute though, but by getting more closely involved. At the end everything can be released, and hopefully this will shift some of the factors at play. Paving the way for a new way of protein engineering\u00a0is also a goal of Open Insulin.\n\nNot sure if there's good answers, I'd love to discuss this more.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-15 08:05:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.378187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 323, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10027], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6084, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6051, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A little Christmas gift for @Nadia , @Noemi and whoever is interested to keep an eye on the shape of the conversation in opencare.\u00a0\n\nI have made a Tulip perspective that contains no graph data, only Python scripts.

They might not 100% fit your needs, but they might bring a few answers, and perhaps help you make choices, and adopt various options.\n\nYesterday before going to bed, I read Cataspanglish's mission report about Elf Pavlik. <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/making-living-edge-elf-pavlik\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/making-living-edge-elf-pavlik </a>\n\nYou should have a look at this report! Pavlik has succeeded in completely removing money from his life. From the bits and pieces of your conversations, it is a lifestyle that might inspire you.\n\nPavlik's story keeps floating in my mind. I proposed at Edgeryders a model of a Luminous Man. I have not yet completed the business plan corresponding to this model, because I am still at the phase of trying to figure out the cause at a quantum level, and their effects and how it works. I know that many people do not want to consider this model and possibilities, but one cannot ignore the fact that there are several individuals, like Pavlik, and many others, who are living by applying completely different sets of values in their lives than mainstream society. Why is that? Where does it come from? What does it teach us?\n\nKeep looking for what would be best for you...\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-03 11:07:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.812176", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 304, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83770, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14414, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Cool.

Ethiopia sounds very interesting (also that you are already so well connected there \u2026 Edgeryders is such a diverse thing it's hard to believe). This scheme could work there for sure, and we'd be happy to provide all the knowledge we gathered so far (for importing cofee into EU etc.), and of course the epelia.com marketplace, in case you decide at any time to start this scheme there.\n\nHowever it needs quite a commitment (assume at least 2 months full-time) and dependable partners at the location to figure out all the details for direct trade with a new country and to get the first farmers started with the system. So \u2026 I think the system can scale / spread to include many other locations, but it's a bit of a challenge with every new place. Also for now, it will not work without going there physically, doing interviews with the individual farmers, taking good pictures and videos of them. Replacing that with \"partner organizations\" just won't work, as potential buyers in Europe are weary of the internal losses, inefficiencies and intransparency of big, layered organizational fair trade schemes.\n\nOn scaling in volume: that is simpler, and the system works better the more volume it can manage. For example right now, air cargo was the only meaningful option for the start for getting the coffee from Nepal. It's of course nonsense in every environmental aspect. With more volume, we can pioneer LCL loads in ISO cointainers going regularly from China to Europe by train now. But nobody has organized that kind of thing in Nepal so far, so we need a bit more trade volume / resources to pioneer it \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-03 12:19:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.797921", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 301, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21050], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26438, "user_id": 166, "topic_id": 3037, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Sam, Daniel, James at Unmon in June</b>\n\n<div class=\"ace-line gutter-author-p-174158 emptyGutter\" data-author-initials=\"JL\" data-author-link=\"/ep/profile/pscsDlfpA7W\" data-author-name=\"James L\" id=\"magicdomid284\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 60px 0px 54px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-left-width: 4px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: rgb(127, 192, 219); font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8em; opacity: 1; -webkit-transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; color: rgb(59, 58, 60); font-family: ProximaNova-Light, nova, arial, sans-serif;\">\n\n<span>Summary of what Sam, Daniel and I would</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>like to do at Unmon in June, which we would enjoy doing together with people at Unmonastery.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"ace-line longKeep gutter-noauthor\" id=\"magicdomid285\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 60px 0px 54px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-left-width: 4px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8em; opacity: 1; -webkit-transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; color: rgb(59, 58, 60); font-family: ProximaNova-Light, nova, arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"ace-line gutter-author-p-174158 emptyGutter\" data-author-initials=\"JL\" data-author-link=\"/ep/profile/pscsDlfpA7W\" data-author-name=\"James L\" id=\"magicdomid7\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 60px 0px 54px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-left-width: 4px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: rgb(127, 192, 219); font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8em; opacity: 1; -webkit-transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; color: rgb(59, 58, 60); font-family: ProximaNova-Light, nova, arial, sans-serif;\"><span>1) Play with hackathon and living/working space concepts</span></div>\n\n<div class=\"ace-line gutter-author-p-174158 emptyGutter\" data-author-initials=\"JL\" data-author-link=\"/ep/profile/pscsDlfpA7W\" data-author-name=\"James L\" id=\"magicdomid194\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 60px 0px 54px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-left-width: 4px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: rgb(127, 192, 219); font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8em; opacity: 1; -webkit-transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; transition: opacity 100ms ease-out; color: rgb(59, 58, 60); font-family: ProximaNova-Light, nova, arial, sans-serif;\"><span>- We're interested in running small, playful experiments to play with how we interact with each other, and with each other's projects.

Writing thoughts down for future reference as I rework the original text here with more concrete info, I admit they are\u00a0kind of vague still.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>There is a distinction between <em>generating knowledge</em> and <em>creating prototypes/implementing solutions</em>. The former can be classified as science, the latter could be called hacking. Both are interesting, but I reckon it's more interesting to focus more deeply on one for the OpenVillage track. I want to zoom in on science.</li>\n\n<li>Generating knowledge has a more long term character than prototypes and a specific profile in terms of resources &amp; technical complexity. An\u00a0outcome is that results are\u00a0uncertain, invisible or too far in the future to provide much incentive for a community to initiate research. This shows the role of government as an intermediary enabler of\u00a0research for communities who would otherwise not make those high risk high reward choices on their own. This means we have to talk about policy.</li>\n\n<li>It is tempting to commodify the generated knowledge as an attempt to hedge risks and move incentives to the short term. Result: patents, closed access, secrecy. This is where generated knowledge stops being property of the communities it is meant for. Therefore talking about IP (or better: intellectual rights) is central to this\u00a0conversation of citizen science/open science/science as a community service, in my opinion. The boundaries of these terms gets blurry to the extent that it becomes obvious that we should really just talk about a better 'science', no adjectives, as a goal.</li>\n\n<li>Other aspects to be covered that are more obvious: legal &amp; admin, financial sustainability, implementation lessons, people &amp; community roles.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nCurious to hear people's thoughts!\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-27 14:49:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.971155", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 348, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85156, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14600, "post_number": 5, "raw": "might be fun doing an AMA on internet conspiracies? :)) with Travis :)))", "created_at": "2020-10-16 10:21:28.329998", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 10:21:28.329998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 16.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85155], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30041, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1519, "post_number": 37, "raw": "<b>Can you sell this to the grownups?</b>\n\nThanks everyone, I am really enjoying the depth of the debate.\n\nSo here's a side note: given the intellectual firepower that the resilience scene can deploy, how come it is so marginal?

We are not attempting to determine the ultimate 'consensus' position from everyone in the network, nor do we want the voice of one person saying what they think ER should be / could be, in their own version of it. Instead, the invitation is for an informed opinion and assessment which is likely to be agreeable to the majority of the community, if not perfectly accurate for everyone.\n\nWe will use the data collected here to start to identify clusters and patterns based on the current taxonomy we have developed (mostly visible in the survey options), and to begin testing methods for collective intelligence and coalition building amongst interested groups, with the goal of developing a dedicated platform for this work to continue in an increasingly open and adaptable format.\n\nIf you are willing to take 10-20min to complete the form, please volunteer your name in a comment and if no one else responds or suggests otherwise within a day or two go ahead! I will follow up here as soon as a valid response comes through.\n\nThank you.

Now unMonastery is not taxing anyone, but it is likewise a diverse entity that can make use of pretty much everything. And when it organizes activities for locals, or locals feel grateful for some service or help through unMonastery, they could be welcomed to just drop things that they don't need any more but uM might find useful.\n\nI did not put it into the wiki because it's a proposal for a future extension of the uM business model, instead of documenting the current one. The problem with barter is of course the coincidence of wants: unMonastery would have to be very tolerant in what it accepts for barter. But some basic items, like food, would always be possible.

In addition to that, a combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of the on-line interaction between these grass-root activists enabled us to provide concrete recommendations for the future policies.\n\n\u201cSpot The Future\u201d is a project aimed at locating and connecting local grass-root activists and social entrepreneurs in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia. This is done by the means of Internet platform where users are encouraged to share their experiences, share their projects and visions, find their peers and establish new connections with a focus on future collaboration with the representatives of other social innovators in their own and other countries, as well as with the UNDP representatives. The uniqueness of the Spot The Future approach is embedded in inclusiveness, horizontal networking, orientation towards real-action solutions instead of pure networking. All the participants of the on-line and off-line discussions are perceived as experts, and the project team was taking a role of facilitators, encouraging involvement in on-line and off-line discussions, offering assistance, but leaving the decision-making role for the participants. This approach led to horizontal cooperation between grass-root activists on national and international level and provided the UNDP with an extensive map of social activism in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia.\n\nIn addition to that, a research team consisting of social network specialists and an ethnographer conducted an extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of the on-line interaction in the Spot The Future platform. Social network analysis and ethnographic qualitative data analysis of the posts and comments of the Spot The Future platform, added another level of understanding of the ground environment of the social actors in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia.\n\nThe quantitative and qualitative on-line data analysis, supplemented by the analysis of data obtained through off-line focus-group discussion revealed that social activists in these three countries are not satisfied with prevailing top-bottom approach to social challenges, are disappointed by the quality of vertical cooperation with governmental institutions, international organizations and other main top-bottom approach players, are challenged by the traditional market economy. They showed preferences to horizontal cooperation, innovative approaches, localized initiatives, collective action and informal economy. These results allowed us to formulate future policy recommendations for the UNDP and other institutional development players in Armenia, Georgia and Egypt.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-19 17:30:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.125853", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 484, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31105], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32918, "user_id": 3045, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 42, "raw": "<b>back on the paper</b>\n\nDear Noemi, Federico and all, sorry for having disappeared, I was travelling and I have been much more busy than I could imagine.

Concerns around this usually pull two ways---- first, sharing tactics to get around these legal issues, and second, a discussion or question on whether it is safe to do so. In some cases, the law is there to ensure people's safety. In others, it impedes it. (This is in part what I wrote on in <a href=\"http://blog.castac.org/2016/10/hippocratic-hacking/\">this piece)</a> It's a complex issue that people have been discussing across different health and social care problems on the site.\u00a0\n\nMental health, too, is a key issue being discussed all over the site. Often it is tied to trauma, which is in turn tied to migration in a lot of cases. But lately I've been seeing an expansion of the discussion on mental health--- not just focused on refugee issues, but also mental health issues across populations. Youth come up frequently, as do\u00a0 feelings of hopelessness in the face of the current labour market. There has been a repetitive feeling of disconnect between one's own dreams and desires and the way cultural and social norms, as well as existing labour and $ structures, require one to live and attribute value to activities.\n\nMost of the solutions, at least as I have observed, are community-based. Modern life is extremely individualising, and for both mental health problems and feeling trapped by a legal system, reaching out to others for care, support, and ideas provides a way out. Alternative ways of living, thinking, and dreaming are put forth by communities, and allow individuals to imagine different futures.\n\nThere seem to be technological solutions for this kind of community-building --- mainly, platforms for bringing people together and allowing them to share knowledge.\n\nThose are my initial thoughts and interpretations!\n\nTwo final notes:\n\nFor some reason, duplicate tags frequently get created for the exact same word or phrase (I'm not sure why this happens). I can merge duplicates, but it requires going to the taxonomy manager each time so I usually only do it after I complete a large enough batch. It would be great to know why this happens and get a fix for it.\n\nResearch question should be separated out as it isn't a true code, just a way of aggregating questions that community members are asking.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-24 19:07:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.597753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 437, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9905, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 823, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Saw the movie.</b>\n\nI remember the movie and how influential it was when it appeared some years ago, still is.

Basically there as been two main group, however: the one which did nice-rome and the one which did rome-athens (of course some people from the first group remained during the second phase: the five or six who actually did the whole march from nice to athens).\n\nAdd the fact that the national composition \u00a0was very wide...and you will figure out that it might have been complicate.\n\nHowevere I can say that except some normal contrasts due to the continous staying together and to some sort of competition that always appear in small groups the avarage of the relationships has been pretty good.\n\nTwo could be considered the main problems we have had, based on lack of trust and on the special context: people thinking that someone in the group wants to manipulate decisions and people being afraid of police undercovered.\n\nBoth the issues are normal and related to the exceptional conditions of the March.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the dynamics is that every single decision was made thanks to an assembly, totally horizontal....this means that we have spent a lot of time talking!\n\n<b>Now:</b>\n\nWell now that the March is finished the plan was to make an international agora in Athens, but it was not up to the March to organise it: there is a group of people in Athens who did it.\n\nFor the March the mission is accomplished: some of us are back home (like me) some others are still in Athens until the end of the Agora (tomorrow) and they will go back home at \u00a0some timecountries, or are\u00a0\n\n<strong>Next step:</strong>\n\nThere is not a next already decided step for this group.

It was an opportunity to reconnect with the people within the network, as well as make new friends.\n\nOur discussions on the roadtrip to the venue were wide ranging. We covered the work of Carl Jung; the alchemy of communities; theoretical physics; and the practical applications of magic in the hands of the storyteller! All normal discussions to have in a car full of Edgeryders.\n\nThese topics provided me with a context for the following days.  All my discussions and conversations then became viewed through these strange lenses. After a few months in the wilderness it became clear to me how much i value and rely on the Edgeryders community.\n\nThe next steps on the Edgeryders journey seem so exciting and challenging. So much of our current journey is looking at how we live together better - with discussions happening around the OpenVillage format; developing physical spaces that we can live and work together and improve the quality of life for both ourselves, and the communities in which we live. While this inevitably involves thinking about the technological solutions, the ways we communicate internally and externally, and the future of the work/life relationship, there are other factors at play as well. As a writer and cultural manager, i\u2019m most interested in the ways in which we express ourselves artistically in these new environments. Where is the space for artistic expression (both within our own lives and in our external relationships with the wider world) within this framework? With increase time and scope for self-actualisation and better work/life balances, where is the gap for play? And what might that look like across Edgeryders spaces and places?\n\nI see a lot of creative and cultural practitioners in the community, working in diverse areas; for institutions and for communities; artists; writers; cultural organisers; journalists; videographers; etc. The whole spectrum of artistic and cultural practice wither exists on the site, or has passed through our community either online or at live events.\n\n**_I\u2019m frequently asking myself: \u201cwhat brings us together, here\u201d and \u201cwhat can hold us together, here\u201d._**\n\nThere\u2019s evidently something within the discussions, practices and research on this platform that attracts those working within these intersections. So how do we find ways of tapping into that creative energy and provide opportunity to people from those backgrounds to explore their practice through the Edgeryders framework?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a series of big questions. Not all which we\u2019re close to answering yet, but there\u2019s a good core of people for whom these questions keep coming up, and i want to try to utilise that connection and the energy that comes from it to craft something magical. Something special. Something unique, that can only come together out of the alchemy of this community.\n\n**So what does that mean on a practical level?**\n\nWe are **looking for interesting partners and funders** who are aligned not only with Edgeryders current goals and principles, but also those whose partnership and integration may help us to grow in the directions we are most drawn to. We look to people whose interests align to help shepherd that process.\n\nSecondly, we are undertaking a comprehensive **mapping exercise to reexamine the conversations and people in Edgeryders over the years,** re-ignite interests and reconnect with people whose journeys with us may have been brief, and to see if this new strand of idea fits with their current practices. This is well underway, but any input into this is welcome, to ensure that we don\u2019t miss out on the edges of our own Edge. Fortunately we have the option of using EdgeSense and GraphRyder to help us do some of the work! Score one for the data scientists!\n\nThirdly, we are looking at building a **research project to look into how digital arts and artists can intersect with modern communal living.** Edgeryders exists so firmly within the digital sphere but as we look to create more permanent real world spaces how can these two worlds come together. What might that look like? How do we marry the world of funded digital art with the ideas of \u2018outsider\u2019 and community arts practices? This idea is still in the creative and shaping stage, so we\u2019re looking for input from anyone who feels like this idea has particular resonance to their own practices (whether artist, or living)\n\nFinally, we continue to think about how the Edgeryders live event formats that we have run and loved fit into this project. There seems to be an overlap where those of us with cultural backgrounds are drawn also to the **event production and the live spaces.**\n\nWe see that there is a need to continue to provide the chance for people already within the community together face-to-face in ways that both support and challenge. We have ambitions to see these events grow and to remain a core part of the ER development process over the next few years. Without the obvious tenpole of projects such as OpenCare, we need to find new ideas that can act as the strong attractors for the community. There are already ideas in the pipeline, but more are always needed.\n\n**Example ideas: A Making-of-community-art kind of camp**\n\nNoemi and I are both interested in collaboratively constructed events that produce real world artefacts, as well as live experiences. We\u2019re inspired by events like poc21.cc (among others), but with an interest in how these events can be used to solve structural social problems, or to investigate community cohesion through artistic and cultural expression. Encouraging participants to attend with their own ideas or practices and to expand them into finished artifacts whilst on site. Edgeryders interests and skills at capturing the processes could help create some interesting data as well as the finished work. Meanwhile, we all get to live and work alongside each other as people. Perhaps the camp expands after the final day to become something for the wider public? Inspired by the festival ethos of places like Borderland and Burning Man.\n\nIt\u2019s a continuation of the LOTE idea, and the OpenVillage Festival design process. But, with opportunities for growth and development of cultural practitioners through creative means.\n\nSimilarly, we are in discussions looking at the next steps for the EconSciFi group. We are exploring how this reading and discussion group grows into a live event, with iterations over the next 12 months. With these events there is another chance to reach out to new interesting groups; participants; partners; and wider audiences. More ways to bring a small slice of the Edgeryders way towards the centre.\n\nI know there are many other ideas like this bubbling under the surface\n\n**So how can you help? We have the 3 core next steps that you can respond to**\n\nWho could be good sources of funding to help support the development of the research project, and/or the live event ideas? Who should we be talking to that may be perfect partners for delivering either of these ideas?\n\nHow could we create a self sustaining research topic that can interest and engage as many people already within the ER network as possible, whilst also providing useful outputs to help us on our journey?\n\nWhat do you see as being the next step for Edgeryders events?

I don't know Ouishare well but know the other two. I don't see any advantage to Edgeryders joining a group based in New Zealand (Enspiral). Sure, there are plenty of overlaps in culture, but Enspiral is quite homogenous (IT people working for themselves) and I don't know how Edgeryders would fit in - it has broader aims and methods. Also, for Edgeryders to merge with Enspiral, it would probably need to accept the primacy of the Enspiral Foundation - why would it do that?. Maybe in years to come when there are, say, 50 or more open, networked, purposeful communities like this and they are operating on a larger scale, we will see increasing mergers as best practice from each is drawn out and spread and it gets easier for the cultures to blend. But for now I think there is still huge value in different players pursuing different strategies and tactics to make the world a better place. There is more than enough room for several \"players\" in the market for now.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-04 09:17:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.380612", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 186, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87425, "user_id": 6964, "topic_id": 14769, "post_number": 29, "raw": "Hello @noemi \nbased in rural Polish countryside I am a researcher in a field of management studies (main topics: alternative management, critical management, permaculture management, eco-villages).

However the trust building seldom takes place, because there is no other, smaller opportunity to interact or work together. It's kind of an endless loop. So in my view this comes back to finding small projects to kickstart further cooperation. I think this was also mentioned during the workshop in Brussels on the 24th.\n\nAnother is the lack of time, skills and\u00a0resources of people and initiatives to invest in building something that stimulates connection, interaction, collective learning, cooperation.\n\nThe people behind initiatives seem to share some characteristics.

Why do the auto industry seem more interested in profits than in life? What if we could build a car company on principles of stewardship? Riversimple was started more than 10 years ago with these and other questions. We are now at the point where we are optimistic of having our first hydrogen powered cars on the roads in the UK by the end of next year.\n\nWe started by re-thinking the car and realised this wasn't enough - we need to re-think the auto industry. We then realised that this wasn't enough. We need to re-think the whole company legal framework, something that has barely changed (in the UK) since 1855.\n\nWhat we have now is a design for a car that will be the most aerodynamic and energy efficient commercial vehicle in the world. It will not be available for sale (since a sale of product model encourages obsolescence) but only for lease, on contracts from a few months to a few years. It has been designed by a team, led by the man who led the team designing the modern Fiat 500.\n\nWe also intend to make our technology available on-line, through the independent open source foundation we established called 40 Fires.\u00a0\n\nThe really exciting thing is that stewardship is embedded into the DNA of the company. The board are obliged by law to serve the purpose, which is \"to build and operate cars whilst systematically eliminating the environmental damage caused by personal transport.\" What's more the board are appointed by and report to, \"custodians\" who speak for different stakeholders - investors, customers, staff, suppliers, the community and the planet. Yes, we have appointed a spokesperson for Mother Earth, who has formal power within the organisation.\u00a0 As far as we know this is unique in the world.\n\nWe have raised and invested more than \u00a310m so far. Currently we are finishing a beta version of our car, which should be ready for public viewing in February 2015. We then need to raise more funding, to start a trial in the UK in the second half of next year.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-20 10:56:01", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 16:56:46.800511", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 396, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 161.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095, 1856, 4, 97, 5, 4140], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46255, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8850, "post_number": 2, "raw": "As we're discussing face to face, some notes... \n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:8850\"]\nIt\u2019s a series of big questions.

And more specifically, the question I ask here is what is the \"culture\" itself of the Edgeryders community? The culture and conditions of this kind of work... \nThere's an opportunity in aligned movements in terms of \"next-generation\" anything or \"the future of work/ culture/ community\" to be paying attention to the how we are together ass much as the what we're doing together. \nFor example, my latest research project was entitled \"Thinking-making-living spaces into biopolitical contrast.\" \n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:8850\"]\nTo start with we are looking for interesting partners and funders who are aligned not only with Edgeryders current goals and principles, but also those whose partnership and integration may help us to grow in the directions we are most drawn to. We look to people whose interests align to help shepherd that process.\n[/quote]\n\nCan access my rich cultural network but foreground that I approach it based on relationships rather than sales.\nTwo different iterations I can think of: \n- Getting a project idea funded and then building the community partnerships to manifest it\n- Collaboratively developing a project idea and then a specific team/ steward sell it\n\nCulture Squad as the core concept for now, a kind of alliance of Edgeryders cultural practitioners and organisations that share mutual interests, approaches... an evolution of the membership network. \nWhat is the hook for them?

How do we marry the world of funded digital art with the ideas of \u2018outsider\u2019 and community arts practices?

The **challenge is to improve the design of cultural experiences by enhancing participatory and collaborative approaches and by fostering mutual cultural understanding and resilient strategies.**\n\n> Scope:\n> Proposals should develop **strategies for fostering collaborative and participative approaches to cultural encounters via communication channels such as social media platforms, participatory approaches, art and co-designed activities.** Proposals should consider both **tangible and intangible heritage, researching new applications and tools that allow for a more inclusive approach such as digital tagging of objects or co-authoring of societal and place-based memories**. The active involvement and engagement with, different groups or communities such as migrants and other communities at risk of exclusion should be promoted. Proposals should design options for these social groups to review or shape both contemporary and historical content, contribute new material or customise and personalise cultural heritage and digital humanities content in a meaningful and effective way. **Collaborative tools and applications should help the cultural tourism sectors and cultural heritage institutions, NGOs, community organisations etc. in Europe and beyond to enhance the analysis and understanding of cultures and communities.**\n\n> The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.\n\n> Expected Impact:\n> The action will contribute to **fostering cultural diversity and social cohesion and to the recognition of multiple identities and voices**. It will also have a positive impact on cultural institutions by attracting contributions from and boosting involvement of new audiences. In addition, **the action will provide disciplines such as computing, design and the social science and humanities with new research tools**.\n\nWhat are your thoughts @alberto @noemi @alex_levene @bob @natalia_skoczylas @hugi@nabeel_p @matteo_uguzzoni @mariacoenen @Sofien-Dahem @HadeerGhareeb @kate_g @iriedawta (And can someone please forward to Annette Mees?)", "created_at": "2018-07-12 15:12:03.031089", "updated_at": "2018-07-12 15:12:03.031089", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 549, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 430.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4275, 4511], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41215, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7980, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Guys.

Greg is a mathematician (his PhD is in mathematical physics). I was lamenting that I did not know when was \"enough\" in terms of what we call \"thick description\" in anthropology  -- what we discussed as \"stories\" in our white paper meeting the other day, and what we also call \"evidence\" in our SSNA paper. I said -- to capture all the nuances of the situation, there are so many sub-arguments that I want to argue underneath my main argument. But I don't have room, and no one will read an 10000 page tome (plus, my thesis has a word count limit of 100,000). How much is enough to evidence the argument? And how much detail do I need to take the argument into? \n\nHe said this reminded him of Taylor's Theorem, which he proposed might help me metaphorically. I'll explain it below in an oversimplified form. ![Screenshot 2020-10-28 at 09.33.13|511x690](upload://n79zA3Fivki8dmN06frHFSP1re8.png) \n\nThe question he posed: let's say we have a function, and we don't know what the function is, but we know it's very, very complicated. We know for the function, we input a real number and the function spits out another real number for an infinite amount of real numbers. How can we learn about what the function does without having to know every detail of the function itself? \n\nThe answer is to start with a zeroth order approximation -- in this illustration, f(0). We can take a range of values very close to zero (the range on the number line at the top). And then we have the next term, O(x), which tells us the error. OK, we are not satisfied. Let's add another approximation, which turns out to be linear, xf'(0). And we keep going until some point at which we feel we have approximated enough and the error is low enough that adding another approximation does not add significantly to our understanding of the function. \n\nHe proposed, based upon our conversations about anthropology, to think about it in that way. We make our best first order approximation, and we look at how much of the big complex story (because humans and human behaviour are extremely complex, very contextually determined, etc) is left out when we do that. OK, not good enough. Then we go and add detail to the description we already wrote (this is the diagram at the bottom). Still not good enough. OK, add more. Then we go until the addition of new information or \"thickness\" doesn't add significantly to the understanding of the phenomenon we are describing (or until we run out of room). \n\nI think it's a useful metaphor, and it maps on to the idea of \"theoretical saturation\" that we have in social sciences, as well. And anthropological writing is always an approximation, because to not approximate we would have to write every detail of the story. The question is -- what details are our strongest, most relevant, to explain the phenomenon we have observed? \n\nThis doesn't really answer \"how we know what we know\", but it does help explain how we get there and how to explain anthropological knowledge production. (I was also reminded of Bayesian inference a bit, metaphorically, when we discussed this --- because it also incorporates the idea that given more information, your explanation of a phenomenon/ability to predict an unknown becomes more accurate in somewhat predictable ways.)", "created_at": "2020-10-28 09:43:30.540403", "updated_at": "2020-10-28 12:15:32.349260", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 590, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 36.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85405], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41198, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7920, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Graphryder is indeed up to date.

Any initiative's a priori outcome is a random variable. The realization of that random variable can be very far off its expected value, way into the tails of its probability distribution. 90s dotcomland was a world with fat tailed probability distributions; you would expect to fail, but could score really, really big. An implication of this is that you can't make the next Google by volition: you can only be angle for the big break and be ready if you get it. Another implication is that it is a good idea to have a plan B.\n\nOn top of this, our decentralized approach has the advantage that we don't have to agree to work together (for network values of \"together\"). What matters to you what my ambitions are, as long as I help building the unMonastery? You are welcome (encouraged, in fact)\u00a0to fit it into your own scheme. I'd rather spend time building it rather than trying to align ambitions.\u00a0\n\nSo, you might wonder, why am I diverting (quite literally) time from unMonastery building to this debate? Because I think in terms of community. Community is the\u00a0<em>only</em> ace up our sleeve \u2013 everybody else has got large orgs, big money, government power etc. In those terms, telling people anything not resulting in building the next Google is a failure <em>is a really bad idea</em>: it sets the bar impossibly high for most people (though I salute your upbeat attitude!). So I came out of the woodworks to vouch for fire hydrant building to be a worthy goal in and of itself, in case someone out there was getting anxiety.

We don't know exactly the price of our vehicles yet - it will depend on multiple factors. But we aim to be competitive - so it shouldn't cost more to rent our car (on say a three year contract) than it would to own a conventional vehicle. Having said that, when we first enter the market our costs are likely to be higher than they will be later on so we might need to charge a premium.\u00a0\n\nAs for car sharing, we love car sharing but wouldn't offer it ourselves. There are plenty of companies very good at this and we would hope to work in partnership with them. We think our car will be ideal for car share companies.\n\nAs for the custodians, this is quite complex (it took us years to figure it out) although fairly simple once you understand it. Usually the board (who run the company) are appointed by investors. This means they tend to prioritise the interests of shareholders, which tend to be short-term and the opposite of stewardship. We want our board to balance interests - people and planet, organisation and community, short-term and long-term - and so we want the board to be appointed by people who represent a diversity of interests: customers, suppliers, the community, investors, the planet...

Hence, my first hypothese that 'introverts' cope better, at least more 'naturally' with confinement. \nMore importent, however, for the questions that  @matteo_uguzzoni asked, I notice that *the  mind is takeing over.* Being deprived from habitual inputs the mental processing of the actually sensed environement gets enriched (= 'wetware is enriching the virtual reality').The internal talk/story in the/my mind (for example when writing) gets an additional 'visual support', that is, a kind of scene is depictured, more dreamed than even fuzzily 'seen'). Hypothese: It is the intuitive bit (of INTJ) that plays its role more prominetly because its counterweight 'sensing' is deprieved from input. Subsequently, along these lines of thought, the 'thinking -judging' part of an INTJ-profile seems to help in the given circustance: *analyis what is to be done and rule-based operations*. Subsequently, my '[reserach] question(s)': If confined by the pandemic, does it help to be an INTJ. How do differnt Meyers-Briggs type cope with confinement?\nBack to Matteo's question; I spend many ours working (alone!) at my desk on some drafting projects. Not many video sessions. Nobody else  but my wife is calling for coffee... In that (lonely / peaceful) situation, sometime, I start a video session and send a link  (by WhatsApp) for it to a friend or an acquaintance. Once while he/she comes 'into the office' and we have a chat. Often nobody comes in, but it feels like having an open office door.If my work demands it, I close the door (= switch the room off).\n\nbest regards, Martin\n\np.s. **e**NTJ was talking here...", "created_at": "2020-12-05 11:35:10.718811", "updated_at": "2020-12-05 11:35:10.718811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 305, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 83.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 347, 5, 3323, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14733, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6142, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>This makes me happy</b>\n\nImpressive to see it in numbers, visuals and anecdotes like that. This is only the tip of the iceberg, surely. I see some big potential in being able to look at the research process in this way.\n\nIn my experience with alternative research\u00a0models, and especially when interacting with classically trained researchers, it does not occur to them that there\u00a0are possible correlations between the research process and the value of the research outcomes. They are\u00a0locked in how they have been doing things for years, naturally.\n\nFor example, citizen science as an approach is overwhelmingly commonly\u00a0reduced to an alternative method for collecting data. A tool, not a different process. A way to collect data\u00a0and involve people a little by doing so, rather than involving people in the whole process and having them collect data in addition to formulating questions, designing experiments etc. all along the way.\n\nI was at a conference dedicated to the\u00a0topic last week; a full programme, even quite diverse for most standards, and data\u00a0collection and related issues were\u00a0all anyone wanted to talk about. Insight does not progress if the wrong questions are being asked. It is detrimental if forms of participatory science are looked at only in this way. A perspective like the one you just posted could help to radically change that, to show that better questions should be asked.\n\nThe potential goes beyond that well into actual research. Coupled with the use of the Edgeryders platform, it's valuable as\u00a0digital infrastructure to manage a research project, a way of setting up a 'meta' research regarding the process, an analysis tool to see if there is actual merit to a participatory process, and a way for pouring everything\u00a0into hard conclusions.\n\nI\u00a0think\u00a0of Open Insulin right away @dfko . It would really drive a point home if we could validate the way you, and hopefully soon we, are\u00a0doing the research.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-02 19:24:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.077859", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 353, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 157.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 3, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39325, "user_id": 2070, "topic_id": 2784, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Hey guys,\n\nI think I can be of help to contact the TEDx Yerevan team and negotiate with them, also help to figure out the potential audiences and ways of communication to reach out to them.", "created_at": "2017-11-14 08:09:06", "updated_at": "2017-11-14 10:40:23.565702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [2817], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33014, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 2308, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>sorry! + logos</b>\n\nHi [jonocosa],\u00a0\n\nsorry for vanishing, a million things are happening, among them that we have no internet connection.

When it started there were only 30 authors, and they had an idea to quickly reach a fairly large number of people.\u00a0\n\nThe idea involves a tool called <a href=\"http://twitterfeed.com\">Twitterfeed</a>. The main idea is that you tell your Twitter account to tweet whenever a website publishes a new update (also works with Facebook and Linkedin). Once you set this up, there is no need for further action: all updates from the site are automatically tweeted by your account, until you decide to revoke that instruction. The website does not need access to your username and password.\n\nIt works like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We all created accounts on Twitterfeed</li>\n\n<li>We linked our Twitter and Facebook accounts to Che Futuro's RSS feed. An online magazine is basically a multiauthor blog, so the fit was good. Drupal is also very good at creating even highly specific RSS feeds through the Views module (<a href=\"http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/70994/how-to-create-an-rss-xml-feed-on-my-drupal-7-site\">see</a>), so Edgeryders and LOTE5 are also a good fit.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Each of us customized the way the RSS feed-driven updates would look on our Twitter stream, to differentiate our own tweets from Che Futuro's. There are several parameters to do this:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>frequency with which the feed is checked (30 mins to 24 hours)</li>\n\n<li>maximum number of updates you want to publish. For example, if you set it to 2 and the website has published 3 new updates since the feed was last checked, only 2 of them will be published onto your Twitter account.</li>\n\n<li>where you want to publish the updates (Facebook/Twitter/Linkedin)</li>\n\n<li>prefix/suffix: for example, I prefix all Che Futuro's updates like this: \"Dal team @chefuturo: \". This helps my followers distinguish between my own tweets and the magazine's.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI think this makes sense for LOTE5 and Edgeryders in general. It is a simple way for people who want to help, but have little time, to do so; and for us to leverage the power of community into communication with a human face.. or actually many of them.

Additionally, <strong>any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care</strong>, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.\n\n<strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong>\n\nThe purpose of the OpenCare PopUp Village is to demonstrate that this is indeed possible.\n\n<strong>During the past 12 <span>\u00a0</span> months, we have driven a transnational research project on the future of health and social care.</strong> Through <a href=\"http://opencare.cc\">OpenCare</a> <strong>we have connected with hundreds of partners, investigating radical solutions to social and healthcare systems under strain</strong>, failing to cater to the needs of growing and ageing populations.\n\n<strong>These solutions are often under-the-radar initiatives</strong> - from open source devices for echography to peer-to-peer suicide prevention schemes; from building alternatives to expensive proprietary medical instruments to decentralising the science and production of essential drugs such as insulin.\n\n<strong>Many of them involve neither state\u00a0nor private sector support or funding</strong>. Some are completely informal, some being run by only one hard-working individual. They hunger for peer support and opportunities to collaborate; during the year we have seen them forming partnerships and sharing their ideas and practices, all as a side effect of meeting on our online platform.\n\n<strong>With members in over 30 countries and 4 continents, we\u00a0are currently building a network of opencare cities to scale up the initiative with us. As well as committed partners willing to bring in their own resources as an investment in an exciting new venture. </strong>\n\nThe OpenCare PopUp Village will be a series of participant built festivals, with project demonstrations and a vibrant community spirit. <strong>Our ambition is to connect local actors in your country, with peers from all over the planet.</strong> Before the physical gatherings even start, a lot of preparation happens openly online. This means <strong>there is plenty of room for partners and attendees to shape the content, or for taking ownership of spotlight themes.</strong>\n\n<strong>For more information: </strong>Contact\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:community@edgeryders.eu\">community@edgeryders.eu</a>, or come to one of informal weekly online\u00a0video calls: Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays at 18:00 CET\u00a0<a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/call/in6dfwadzfdsldfynvnsatf75me\">here</a>\u00a0.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-07 15:08:47", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:37:26.630158", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 895, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1284, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1251, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I don't look for jobs anymore.

So, it is possible that, for example, \"diabetes\" co-occurs with \"product design\" strongly, whereas \"mental heath\" co-occurs with \"information sharing\" strongly.

It is frequently in our papers and on our televisions, yet beyond the UK and the direct environment of Calais the Calais camp has not received the kind of attention it deserves.\n\n\u2018The Jungle\u2019, as it has become known, is a large camp on the edge of the Calais port area. It sits on top of a series of sand dunes, small lakes and wastelands on the very edge of the French coastline, right by the lorry parking area at the port. Before it was settled it was an industrial dumping ground, and previous checks of the ground have found traces of heavy metallic elements like Cobalt, as well as large amounts of old asbestos panelling that had broken down.\n\nOn top of all this sits a huge camp for migrants and displaced people from around the world. At last count it stood at around 4900 people, most of whom are trying to claim asylum in the UK.\n\nAt it\u2019s largest point shortly after Christmas the camp had over 6000 residents. Living in very harsh, cold conditions through the Northern Europe winter.\n\nOriginally the camp was made up of tents and very temporary structures. But from around September last year a number of new charity organisations and volunteer structures made it their plans to help improve the quality of the camp [<a href=\"http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/\">http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/</a>].\n\nThe camp is largely made up of young men, although there are small numbers of families, women and young children as well as around 350 unaccompanied children between the age of 12-16. A number of organisations sprang up that work with the women and children on site, provided youth clubs, teaching and English lessons. [<a href=\"http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/camp-initiatives\">http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/camp-initiatives</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/\">http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/</a>]\n\nThe camp has grown up, physically and mentally, over the last 5 years, but has really become a focal point since around 2012. The camp has grown hugely during this time, as well as moving around from site to site.\n\nAlongside the humanitarian and social aid there are library and reading services [<a href=\"http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library\">http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library</a>], theatre and arts activities [<a href=\"http://goodchance.org.uk/\">http://goodchance.org.uk/</a>], community kitchens [<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OneSpiritAshramKitchen/\">https://www.facebook.com/OneSpiritAshramKitchen/</a>][<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/The-Belgian-Kitchen-1736739086546935/\">https://www.facebook.com/The-Belgian-Kitchen-1736739086546935/</a>], hot food distribution, dry food goods distribution and daily clothing distributions provided from a central warehouse [<a href=\"http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/\">http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/</a>], amongst many others [<a href=\"http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/\">http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/</a>].\n\nYou can find out more about a numbers of the organisations that work on the site by visiting [<a href=\"http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news\">http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news</a>] or by reading the No Borders document [<a href=\"https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf\">https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf</a>]\n\nAlthough MSF, GWB and Unicef run services on the site, and have provided some care to the camps the site itself is not officially recognised by the French or UK governments, and as such has no requirements to meet basic human rights, or follow local building or health and safety guidelines.\n\nAs a result, no single government or NGO organisation has responsibility for the activities and structures on camp. Everything that has grown up has happened through self-organisation, communication and collaboration between new and existing charities both French-based and in the UK.\n\nIncreasingly we are seeing aid, and charities from further afield in Europe coming to Calais to help, creating a multi-national series of solutions that have grown up without any direct hierarchy or guidance.\n\nIn March the French prefecture with the support of the CRS cleared the oldest, largest section of the camp in the south. The intention was to rehouse all of the residents in to a number of local official options; including the La Vie Active container camp [<a href=\"http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/\">http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/</a>]; the brand new official refugee camp in Dunkirk [<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html</a>] or into asylum/detention camps around France.\n\nThe majority of residents in the camp chose to not take these options as they are not looking to seek asylum in France, but are trying to get to the UK to reconnect with families. This disconnect between what the French authorities want to achieve with the residents and what the residents themselves want to achieve goes a long way toward explaining the conflict and central problem at the camp.\n\n<strong>About what i have been doing</strong>\n\nFor the past 3 weeks I have been working as a volunteer through the central warehouse, L\u2019Auberge des migrants.\n\nL\u2019Auberge acts as the central aid and food distribution services for the camps across Northern France, including Calais, Dunkirk and a number of smaller camps around the area.\n\nL\u2019Auberge exists solely on donations, providing daily hot food deliveries, daily dry food deliveries to allow residents to cook for themselves, clothing drops, and since my arrival a mobile distribution service that goes from shelter to shelter, assessing individual and community needs and providing aid in the form of blankets, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, lights and a number of other personal items.\n\nAll of these services are coordinated by long to medium term volunteers, who spend their own money and time to care for the people on camp without receiving any direct pay. Sometimes fundraised money is spent to provide accommodation and travel expenses to volunteers but a large majority of people live out here entirely on the own funds.\n\nThe warehouse was initially set up by a French charity but is now run and \u2018staffed\u2019 by a UK charity HelpRefugees [<a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/\">http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/</a>], who bring in funding and support from around the EU to help provide humanitarian services.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.html\">http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.html</a>\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.....\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CALAIS\">https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CALAIS</a>", "created_at": "2017-11-14 11:34:08.342670", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:09:41.519234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1186, "wiki": false, "reads": 40, "score": 308.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067, 5, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39737, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7757, "post_number": 1, "raw": "At the conference, @lakomaa finally gave me a copy of the paper, that I have now read. It makes for a great read, I really appreciate the effort to take a high level view.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n1. Section \"The increasing cost in health care\" suggests that the ethics of care is such that cost-reduction innovation is not incentivised in formal care institutions. This suggests that part of the systemic impact of open care might come from reaping the opportunities for cost reduction innovation that the formal system forgoes. This even resonates with the large efforts communities in preventative care that emerges from the opencare conversation. Yet, this is not discussed in the paper. There is only one sentence in the conclusions, but it does not latch to examples or data. I wonder why?\n\n2. \"In this study, the cases are limited to those using information technologies\". Why? It's counterintuitive, given @amelia's conclusion number one, \"when in need of care, people reach for other people, not for technology\".\n\n3. Section \"\"When does open care emerge?\" lists some success factors for open care projects. Based on what? How many cases? Collected and classified how? Etc.\n\n4. The same section makes an intriguing observation. \"Most open care projects are organized as non-profits.

You need a long, long time to understand how representations are enacted, or objects circulate in the \"native environment\", i.e. you need to wait that things happen and understand what is noise and what communication, what is relevant and what not, then switch metaphors, talk to different people, change you mind and perspective on what you thought was a main issue, as something is not working as explanation, or doesn't fit in former descriptions.\n\nThings look already so different since the beginning of the research and are always \"on the move\"; i mean that i cannot just frame a daily activity and describe it to come up with coding. You need to access the whole cosmology, the history, the network of values and what is really shared by people here. What i say is that \"to understand makers you must think as makers\". Here you have open innovation in a openspace for a opencare project. And it is not a matter of describing what happens online or on place, given that such projects have different phases lasting more weeks, even months. So designing and daily activities are dedicated to many aspects and involving different people not present at the same time. About designing community it takes also time to experience and evaluate practices involving many participants.

So, make a social network centered on the \"client\" and bring down the coordination costs of care. Their USP is <a href=\"http://tyze.com/business/home-and-community-care/\">here</a>:\n\nHOW TYZE CAN HELP YOUR BUSINESS\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tPushing schedules and daily care documentation into clients\u2019 Tyze networks = Reduced inbound support costs</li>\n\n<li>\tAbility to extend brand to those who share in the care journey of your client = Increased brand awareness</li>\n\n<li>\tDigital delivery of informational and support materials = Reduced printing costs</li>\n\n<li>\tEnhanced communication and care coordination via a Tyze network = Increased customer satisfaction and retention</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTyze per se is low value added technology. Youy could do the same thing with wikis, Trello, Google Apps and whatever. They have a solid intuition behind it, though, and the people using Tyze, and how they coordinate,\u00a0and who they are etc. could tell many interesting stories to OpenCare.\u00a0\n\nThe meaning of my statement above are: <em>people</em>\u00a0are already implementing A1 systems\u00a0(they deliver care and they are open) by making A2 stuff (inventing and producing services etc.). We conjecture that openness in the process (2) is an enabler of A1. More precisely, we conjecture that without open processes (B2) there can be no open care (A1), but the reverse is not true.\u00a0You can use open, participatory processes to design closed systems and artifacts. I guess the implication is to study closely the B2 side of things, and how openness in the process results (or not) in A1-type open care.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-18 08:45:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.376031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26600], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87403, "user_id": 6962, "topic_id": 14773, "post_number": 48, "raw": "**I want to take part in the webinar.** <br /> Yes <br /><br /> **My idea/suggestion for building the world:** <br /> Transform government by creating an authentic relationship with citizens <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-11-22 19:40:49.030697", "updated_at": "2020-11-22 19:40:49.030697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 39.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10483, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6201, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Purpose related to OpenInsulin or diabetes education in general?</b>\n\nHi @NiekD and nice to meet you!

I imagine a sort of \"landing strip\": when someone makes it across the border, they are somehow channeled into taking a series of steps towards safety first, and integration later. These steps are not obvious. My analogy is what happens in Milan to Eritrean newcomers: an informal network of people (many of whom Eritrean-Italians) takes newcomers in charge as they take the first baby steps. They need to be picked up at the point of entry (railway or bus stations): telling them \"take the Metro Line 2 and get off at Lambrate\" is not going to work, even if you have a common language to communicate in, because they do not know how to use public transport. So, people call each other to go pick up complete strangers at 5.00 in the morning, ask friends for spare beds and couches as newcomers take aim for the next step, which in Italy is typically trying to get to Sweden/Germany/wherever.

As Nadia pointed out, we could come out with the idea that it's enough to wear an accessory or a symbol, because a uniform is not suitable for such a diverse environment. It's important though to have a live session of discussion, because in that moment we can allow ourselves \u00a0to be a\u00a0bit more intimate about our feelings and attitute towards uniforms, \u00a0and people are more free to share details without being too public.\n\nRegarding the prototyping session, what I'm interested in is showing some techniques to empower people in the ability to prototype concretely starting from very basic shapes. Drawings are definitely not enough especially if we want to involve in the process people without any experience in garment-making. It's easy to make complicated 2d drawings and features, but it becomes a nightmare when you have to cut and sew it. The result I'd want to aim at is to have a documentation of very easy instruction for people to create their own uniform and customize it, without being a tailor.

This is really interesting, as it transposes the usual free riding problem of human communities at the organizations' level. My organization needs to do some work, so that a common good (let's say, a directory) can result from the aggregation of everybody's work. This work is typically uninspiring: housekeeping, like renewing certificates for the website or turning in your VAT return. And if my org does not do it (or does not do it well, for example with regular updates of the data), it can still use the common good. What are your thoughts about how to incentivize organizations to do this work, with an acceptable standard of quality?\n\nI have long thought that important data on organizations already exist, stored in very official state databases (Edgeryders, for example, has a legal obligation to keep some information in the Estonian [Company Registration Portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/index.py?chlang=eng). Problem is, those data are not open. Many states have sprouted publicly owned companies that make money selling them (this predates the Internet, by the way).

But it has a problem: since challenge responses are not part of groups, they are harder to parse between those that belong to different projects. We use parsing to two ends:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>For using in Drupal APIs (through jsonview).</li>\n\n<li>For project-level web analytics</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Parsing nodes for Drupal APIs</h3>\n\nServer side, APIs rely on SQL queries like:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\">SELECT DISTINCT node.title [...]\u00a0WHERE (( (node.status = '1') )AND( (og_membership.gid = '5954')) )</code>\n\nIf you don't have the <code class=\"content-command\">gid</code>\u00a0reference (= Group ID) you are in trouble. In OpenCare, we deal with this simply by including\u00a0<em>all</em>\u00a0nodes of type challenge response:\u00a0\n\n<code class=\"content-command\">[...] WHERE (( (node.status = '1') )AND( (og_membership.gid = '5954') OR (node.type IN ('challenge_response')) ))</code>\n\nWe can only do this once. For the second project, it will be unviable.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Parsing pages for web analytics</h3>\n\nIn OpenCare, I get asked a lot about visits\u00a0<em>to opencare pages.\u00a0</em>With the normal Drupal Commons model, I can do this by filtering pageviews by a regular expression on the URL, because Drupal \"formats\" URLS:\n\n<code class=\"content-output\">https://edgeryders.eu/groupname/pagename</code>\n\nObviously challenge response do not have this. So, there is no easy way to know how many of ERs page views are attributable to project X.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Conclusion</h3>\n\nUnless you have other solutions in mind, I would propose to return to a group-based data model.

UNV has offered to put it at our disposal.\u00a0Noemi was in cc on that exchange, but I wonder whether this is not more up Nadia's street, what with the community management liaison.\n\nThe idea is this: online volunteers will simply be asked to log onto Edgeryders and share what they know about social innovators and changemakers in the six countries. Instant conversation boost! Where we are short of engagement managers we might ask them to suggest some, or put themselves forward.\u00a0\n\nLadies, please get in touch with Elise Bouvet (elise.bouvet@unv.org) about this. We will need a call to action etc. It would be great of we could offer a little training, like participation in the calls Nadia is organizing.\u00a0\n\nPing <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>\u00a0because he might be interested in extending the same approach to the Nepal project.

The more senior or central, the better. Even with a contact and a supporter inside, like in the case of Leeuwarden 2018 (@jort_klarenbeek) things stalled. \n\n* **Making contact over email or phone will not get us far** i.e. so as to schedule meetings in person, be invited to travel and do an event, public pitching etc.\n\n* **The timelines between a public administration and ER are not aligned.** Even after our contracts ended with the winning cities and there was more work in the pipeline - Edgeryders being a partner in some of the projects in the bidbooks + more consultancy work - we found that the timeline in which cities operate is not compatible with our pace. We expect things to happen faster, but we are talking windows of 6 months minimum. With Matera, you can get an idea: the time between our contract in 2014 when they won and August/Sept 2017 when [we partnered up again](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-and-matera-2019-to-build-a-community-of-creative-and-cultural-projects/7205), is.. well, very long :-)\n\n* **Writing random funding applications doesnt work.** Another front was applying for European funding with a grassroots cultural residency modeled on unMonastery and the work in Bucharest - we called it Futurespotters Lab - but we didnt win any - neither the click based competitions nor the proposals with, it needs to be said, rushed and cosmetic partnerships.\n \n\n## Where are we now?\n\nOur most important development is that we have changed the approach and are aiming for across-city services.\n\n1. building an international network of grassroots cultural projects which can deliver projects to cities and be each other's partners- cities would be buying in to be part of it, so to speak. The change is as follows: at the core, we would not fundraise from the cities themselves, but from transnational organisations type ECF.\n\n2. will be deliver a community building training of 2 days in Matera in December, within the new contractual work, and there will be more cities attending. We will present the training as a product for any city wishing to build better community processes and collaboration. \n\n3. [not official yet] we are preparing a webinar with community building content to be delivered to an international cultural network. the sales process was that I went to an event where I hosted a workshop around something else - they liked Edgeryders, recognised expertise and it happens that they want to learn from us.\n\n4. we are partnering up with community members who are already doing work in culture! I.e. with Matteo - for a European funding application around urban games in various cities - in this case, Edgeryders can be an impact partner due to our global network. More details are available if you need them.\n\n\n\nThis is it for now. Me and Alberto I guess are still pursuing this but organically. We might have been more strategic about it, but other things got prioritised.. Also worth noting: the Culture Squad team work was funded with 2K initially from Edgeryders Lbg, with no real results. It is not funded anymore but we keep a live interest.\n\nHope this helps,\nWould appreciate connections with people you meet who are doing work in culture :heart:", "created_at": "2017-11-14 17:19:39.647948", "updated_at": "2017-11-14 17:58:03.849990", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 681, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 182.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3067, 4, 3311, 4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29807, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 6240, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Heads up for Challenge launch next week!</b>\n\nChallenge will go live, looks like you guys could contribute very nicely as there are different specializations and loads of prizes!\n\nhttps://launchforth.io/localmotors/accessibleolli/discussion/topic/calling-all-co-creators/63262/#post_1\n\nAlso paging @Hazem because I saw you are connected to Raul. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-17 21:20:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.063559", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 60, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29771], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16898, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1404, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>What can't you know Andrew O.</b>\n\nHI James,\n\nEvery now and then I have the good fortune of listening to a presentation by Andrew Odlyzko.

One look at the map of the region is enough to understand how difficult for them it would be to access hospitals and doctors otherwise. 2500 islands sit on the Indian part of the river, which starts from the Tibetan mountains and flows through the Assam region, being a home to 3 million people, 10% of the region\u2019s population.\n\nThere are numerous reasons why providing these places with health care is particularly difficult: due to huge shortages of doctors in India to start with (0.7 per 1000 people), shifting territories of these islands, unstable population and difficult living conditions: they\u2019re connected to the land by boats and suffer from frequent energy and drinking water deficit. Not to mention strikingly high numbers in maternal and infant mortality.\n\nSanjoy Hazarika pitched the idea of floating clinics to the World Bank in 2000 and received their support - 20,000 dollars to start with. One year later the first boat sailed to bring care to the Assamese, and until today, 14 more followed. The project was eventually joined by the state, which established a public-private partnership with the trust and started funding the offered service. Each month around 20.000 people in total are reached by these facilities.\n\nSome of the doctors who joined the ships helped to improve their service. One of the keys to success is frequency - by ensuring that each island is visited at least once a month it is possible to take good care of immunization and condition of pregnant women. They also bring the basic medicine, which is cheap in India - but if one needs to hire a boat to get it, the costs soar.\n\nAnd the service provided by the boat is free - the funds provided by the state amount for 72 400 000 million rupees per year - which, after covering the costs of the boat and the staff, means that there are 480 rupees per person left. Around 5 dollars per year.\n\nMore about the project here: http://www.c-nes.org/programmes/boat-clinics\n\nPhoto comes from\u00a0http://www.tehelka.com/2014/07/boat-clinics-provide-healthcare-to-3-million-people-in-assams-river-islands/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-24 16:55:49", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:52:02.072966", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 452, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34430, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 6724, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-08-16 14:03:13.972361", "updated_at": "2017-08-16 14:03:13.972361", "deleted_at": "2018-03-09 17:23:34.926212", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6274, "user_id": 3400, "topic_id": 6241, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Is community-based and participatory health care sufficient?\n\nThe World Health Organization (2003) <a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241545992.pdf\">states</a> that \"Effective treatment for chronic conditions requires [...] a system that is proactive and emphasizes health throughout a lifetime.\"\n\nFor us, three conditions are required to \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\" by 2030, a <a href=\"http://www.globalgoals.org/global-goals/good-health/\">United Nations Global Goal</a>:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Health innovation should be <em>driven</em> by communities and validated with participatory research.</li>\n\n<li>It should focus on <em>prevention</em> and adherence to care, not on expensive tech.</li>\n\n<li>Processes should be transparently documented, and results should be freely available to ensure everyone can use and adapt the work done.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nDo you agree?

We\u2019d like to try to make sense of it all, as a community and with the help of a small research team; the team has been reading, analysing and placing Edgeryders material in contexts that the policy world, including institutions, can make sense of - i.e in the form of <strong>policy research papers</strong>, each addressing a specific theme.\n\nThrough this mission we aim to make sense of the material together! If we use the papers as a starting point for an open and collaborative writing process, as a community we can produce something much better than anything 10 experts in a room can put together. After the validation process is done, Rebecca will then synthesize the main points from the papers, and the community discussions around them into a first version of the transition handbook.\n\nThe transition handbook aims to leverage Edgeryders\u2019 wisdom to the point where it makes an impact in the policy community, by speaking to individuals in institutions charged with addressing specific issues. The document should also speak directly to young people and other Edgeryders, using key terminology as used by Edgeryders themselves.\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBrUGChnuhXamzCWF5OqndAgurog3D1x2pfhPxW2hF0/edit\">For a detailed overview of background, process and your role in building the handbook, as well as tentative structure and production timeline go to this doc. </a></strong>\n\n<h3> </h3>\n\n<h3><strong>Want to help make sense of Edgeryders experiences?</strong></h3>\n\nCompleting this mission basically means reviewing and reacting to the research papers, so mainly commenting on them as they are posted here as mission reports..\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Start by checking out the summary of Rebecca's and Valentina's ethnographic analysis:\n\n<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-transition-getting-the-big-picture/1686\"><strong>Edgeryders transition: Getting the big picture</strong></a>\n\nDo you recognise yourself in the description?
