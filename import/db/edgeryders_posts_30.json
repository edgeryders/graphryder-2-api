Or some sort of combination of other environmental factors... I don't know. Could it have to do with Western diet habits, the 3 meals a day routine, mostly processed carbs, no fasting, lack of short chain fats. Inflammation within the body could be addressed through diet and other lifestyle changes, and dosages of offending molecules aren't well understood either. \n\nApologies for the rambling.

The results came back that I was literally allergic to everything, Grass, Dust, Pollen, other stuff I don't even remember. My arms were all hives.

The way I see it, and through the different stories I have read so far, there is a lot of Empowerment and Advocacy work, on several areas depending on the context of each region, need to be done in order to bring the desired positive change. It is difficult to do that without the support of different Partners and Stakeholders who have the expertise and the resources.

This looks like a super solid idea, congratulations. In fact, I think we should more or less replicate it here in Brussels, for the next iteration of The Reef (May 2018). \n\nThere are differences, of course. The student market is not as important: there are two important universities here, but they are already well served. I think in Brussels we should go more for young professionals (while staying open to not-so-young ones): this is the European Union's capital city, and many people from all over Europe and beyond move here to take up jobs, both in the \"Euro-bubble\" surrounding the European institutions, but also in the private sector. Our new housemate at The Reef, David, is a good example: he is an engineer from Jakarta, Indonesia, and works at Toyota. Professionals have a calmer lifestyle, better suited to how we want our own to be; are more distributed around the city instead of concentrated close to the campuses; and can pay slightly higher rents.\n\nAlso, Brussels is a relaxed, hedonistic city. We have many [great caf\u00e9s](https://www.alamortsubite.com/en/), [roasteries](http://www.smarksthespots.com/best-coffee-brussels/) and [concept caf\u00e9s](https://orcoffee.be/en/bar/espresso-bar-brussels-city-center). So, lots of competition! This also means that the market is large, so it's not necessarily a problem. But the viability of a caf\u00e9 + roastery depends a lot on where the space is. Ideally you want to be in the middle of the business tourism traffic, but that's also where spaces are most expensive.

Just watched the video in the post you linked ... well done!\n\nHere's some more analytical content in addition to my questionairre response.\n\nI gave an example of how it seems to be \"by chance\" that I ran into some people on the platform and interacted a lot with them, and did not meet others there even though I also could have interacted a lot (and did so, at the LOTE conference and unconference). And, the example is about one of these \"induced\" conversations.

And to me it seems that the somewhat limited navigation capabilities of the platform promote this \"element of chance\" in who interacts with whom. Additionally, in my experience there's simply a limit of personal resources (time) that makes it impossible to find all the communication partners one would want to interact with (seems a bit related to the \"communities don't scale\" argument, just that they do scale, but influenced by resource limits).\n\nChance is of course not the best facilitator to partition online communities into sub-communities and to make them scale that way, as it does not necessarily bring the right people together for best synergy.

You are in Scotland: what is it you see? Do you participate personally? Do you know young people getting involved in the referendum, or is your source a statistical one?\n\nSpeaking of statistics, here's a thought. You say sometimes young people get involved in traditional politics to reach a goal and drop out of the process once the objective is achieved: a referendum is a good example. It seems to me that in the past different forms of participation correlated very well across each other: a higher turnout at the election in a certain category of people typically was associated with likelihood to be member of a party, or a trade union (to a lesser degree). When I was young, many environmentalists in Italy claimed that caring about the environment would lead one directly to militating for the political left, via the interconnection between environmental threats and global capitalism. In those days you would expect a high correlation between\u00a0 being a member of an environmentalist group and being a political activist.\n\nNow it seems that correlation is breaking down. Some young people who are passionately involved with one issue, but don't care much about others. The same party might fight with its country's young on one issue, against them on another.\n\nAnd here's another statistics-oriented thought: maybe loyalty does not kick in because traditional parties organize the older citizens, and in the current economic climate the interests of pensioners and young adults are perceived as potentially conflicting. According to its founder Rick Falkwinge, the Swedish Pirate Party gained 8% at the latest European elections, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/22/rick-falkvinge-swedish-radical-web-freedoms?newsfeed=true\">was the most voted party by voters aged 30 and under</a>. Same for trade unions: already in 2003 the median age for union members in the EU was 40 (44 in Italy, 43 in Sweden); in the same year almost 50% of Italian union members were not active workers, but pensioners. I have heard that this figure is now more like 60%, but I have not been able to find a reference online.\n\nThis might be another way that political diversity got reduced: 40- and 50somethings got overrepresented, young people got underrepresented and defected.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-27 16:34:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.206866", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86705, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 14769, "post_number": 19, "raw": "Hi there, last sunday i was visiting a social garden here in Parma, in the northern part of Italy, where members should garden a spot of it and keep it open to the public at least once per season for some activities, mainly cultural. At the same time i'm participating in  a A Study Group for Restoring Planetary Health and Avoiding Human Extinction called \"Earth Regenerators\" (https://earth-regenerators.mn.co/), whose goal is to advocate for bioregions. I think that taking action in cities and towns with youngsters especially, might create a fruitful ground to inspire gardeners, but also farmers and self standing communities in rural areas. In Italy there are many little ghost towns (borghi), some even medieval on the mountains, or abandoned ruined farms in the country side. Financial aids and public support -as far as i know- are not so well developed, although a transition from high intensive coltures to saustainable and bio agricolture are growing year by year. \n![124451676_3640098779376036_3623174321706006116_o|690x517](upload://4qdlGB8z8Qr23QhuDq88IsUdm5M.jpeg) \nFor instance, a group of citizens are taking care of another garden in a far side of Parma called Picasso Food Forest, inspired to urban forests and part of a project called Fruttorti (http://www.fruttortiparma.it/).

We have a dedicated <a href=\"/en/lote6\">discussion group here</a>, feel free to join!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-13 09:56:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.899040", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 182, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31097, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4519, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Local syncing is good</b>\n\nSome phones have a USB master mode, but not all (as trythis mentioned), and for some of those having it it needs rooting (\"jailbreaking\") the phone to activate it. But I like the local syncing idea because it's so simple. It will only need a piece of electronics that (1) accepts a USB stick as USB client, (2) accepts the phone as USB client and (3) accepts instructions from an app on the phone to copy certain files between these two USB mass storage devices. It will even be faster than via wifi. A Raspberry Pi could do that (it saves the $$ for the wifi module and lowers the power requirements). But I am sure we can find simpler and cheaper devices which can also do this, since it's a pretty simple task.

An exercise in imagining the social contract for an online design process that does not happen in real world (e.g.: https://edgeryders.eu/t/fellowship-blog-strategy-labwork-in-august/6819/14 and the entire thread) doesn't appeal as a sound deliverable of the project. Reality, however surprising or uncharming, seems more interesting for us, and for future projects.\n\nHowever, as I also highlighted above, we discovered an ecosystem like OpenCare does satisfy several points of the real world social contract in this living design, concerning the sharing of experiences and best practices, reviewing each others, and such... it hits on transparency, on evidences, on quality... with very low bureaucratic overheads (it's documented while doing)... \nWe were quite excited when we realised this, that is why I am still struggling to grasp why you seem so let down.", "created_at": "2017-09-07 15:53:49.922190", "updated_at": "2017-09-07 15:53:49.922190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 230, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 52.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35735], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35805, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 6977, "post_number": 24, "raw": "Hi @winnieponcelet\n\nthis is an interesting question, as most of those born from changing the frame when reading something.\n\nThe social contract has a \"unifying\" value in being constructed by the community... this is true always, and in this sense any effort of writing one is useless.\n\nHowever, the same power of \"constructing\" is found in \"making sense\",  in \"meaning-negotiation\" among the participants... what does it mean for us \"to do X\".\n\nLet me look for a moment at another example... if you are looking at how people handle nations, you will easily spot the differences in social contracts if you claim that a \"right to work\" exists, or that a \"right to subsistence\" does... the effect of these choices will reverberate on whether a through representative democracy is possible, or the extent of self-determination of the citizens... \nNow this is irrelevant, if all you want to achieve is for people to somehow live together (I often heard the argument that a despotism by illuminated elites may be more effective than an elected democracy... it all depends on what you optimise for after all)... However, if you had in mind to achieve a specific range of behaviours and possible evolutions, the choice does matter.\n\nObserving and making explicit items in a social contract for community driven care that have managed to make their continuing design and evolution sustainable is not meant to prescribe anything... people can still get together wanting to invest some time to gain experience, and they need not to worry about sustainability over time... however, it offers a provocation to reflect about which direction is the process of designing one's own social contract taking, when the desired goal is to build a sustainable care initiative. \nThe group will still have to negotiate (ultimately build) the meaning of each of those items for its own community... a process that will happen at different speeds for as long as they exist... but they will have a reference point to reflect upon what their choices are looking like.\n\nThis is why philosophers of politics have over centuries spent a lot of resources describing the social contracts of their times, trying to understand how they came to be from the past...", "created_at": "2017-09-08 15:02:06.343252", "updated_at": "2017-09-08 15:04:11.791544", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 47.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35784], "is_liked_by": [3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8290, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5469, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Hi and Welcome :)</b>\n\nNice to \"meet\" you Alina.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:\n1. A successful model of 1000 Egyptian youth gathered together on the idea of \u200b\u200bdeveloping Egypt.\n2. Increase the percentage of internal investment.\n3. Development of internal and external tourism through model work for the Maldives, Malaysia and Thailand in Egypt. (Tourism islands) and these are the most places where the Egyptians in their travel.\n4. Establish agricultural and industrial projects without harm to the environment and not rely solely on tourism.\n\nII. THE CAUSE OF THE SELECTION OF JIFTUNE ISLAND:\n1- The length of the island of Jiftun is 18 km and the length of its coast is 43 km.\n2 - away from Hurghada 11 km and this makes it easy to take advantage of the services available in Hurghada.\n3 - Includes 14 sites of the most beautiful diving sites.\n4 - receive about 188 thousand tourists annually and therefore do not need to campaign for a large awareness of the place.\n5. Exploitation of the island comes from entrance fees only island.\nThird: The reason for exploitation of natural islands and reserves in Egypt:\n\n1. Australia generated revenues of $ 2.5 billion\n2 - Canada achieved $ 6.5 billion in addition to providing 125 thousand jobs.\n3 - Italy achieved one billion euros in addition to providing 80 thousand jobs.\nMauritius Island receives about 1,500,000 tourists annually.\nThus, the importance of exploiting the islands in Egypt to increase national income, create job opportunities for young people, and work successful models of Egyptian youth capable of taking responsibility.\n\nIV. How to choose 1000 young people:\nThe 1,000 young people from all over the country will be selected by a dedicated HR team\nThe lesson in selection criteria are:\n1. Ethics.\n2. Ambition.\nIn order to avoid the negatives resulting from the poor morals and frustrations that exist in society now\n\u2022 After selecting individuals\nEach member of the island has a membership card and the card has a number of points and if the person has committed any offense\nThe number of points owned shall be deducted according to the type of violation committed (of course, the sanctions regulation) and if the individual has exhausted the number of points owned by him\nHe is thankful for his time spent on the island.\nThe number of points is also increased for individuals who are positive in helping the people of the island and thus giving them greater advantages based on their positivity\n\u2022 The island is not limited to 1000 young people only, but they represent the population in the General Assembly of the island in accordance with the regulations of the team of human resources.\n\u2022 The expected number of people on the island will be reduced to 50 thousand and jobs will be provided to them in the available fields.\n\nV. ELECTRICITY:\nOnly clean energy generated from:\n1. Solar energy.\n2. Winds.\n3. Water rush.\n4. Power generation by movement (bike).\n\nVI. WATER:\nStudies in Egypt have proved that if we move away from the Nile River 70 km, desalination is the economic option\nTherefore, seawater desalination will be used to provide water for drinking and agriculture.\nVII. Sanitation\nSewage will be treated to be suitable for irrigation of gardens and agriculture.\n\nVIII. Means of transportation:\nYou will be able to use environmentally friendly transportation such as bicycles and golf cars that are powered by electricity\nIX. HOUSES:\nWooden houses is the perfect choice that has been chosen for various reasons:\n1.

Another problems is lack of relevant and up-to-date statistics, which would give the exact numbers of inhabitants of the city to start with, then - bring it down to numbers of people with certain types of disabilities.

In the long run, the way to go is probably to support language skills development of unMonasterians, rather than flanking non-native speakers with native speakers as interface.\n\nLauren reported that at least 10 people asked to be given English lessons in Matera. A possibility would be to host a weekly evening at the unMonastery in which doing conversation in English for, say, one hour, and in Italian (or whatever the native language) for the other hour. In this way, locals and unMonasterians would socialize on the exchange of language skills. Maybe an hour a day of more formal language tutorship in the unMonastery might be considered too.\n\nAnother suggested possibility is to have, say 3 out of 10 native speaker unMonasterians, who would be encouraged to speak in the local language to each other. This means that the local language gets spoken in the house on a regular basis, giving nonlocal unMonasterians more exposure to it.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-05 07:09:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:56.479310", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 266, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39301, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 6999, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-11-13 12:26:09.788705", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 12:27:34.046486", "deleted_at": "2018-03-09 17:09:34.709220", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [36032], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935, 3782, 3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40498, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7859, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@amelia you are of course right... stupid mistake in a function.

The distinction does not really apply here, because one of the ingredients of our method, ethnography, is, by your definition, itself trans. I guess that makes SSNA \"meta\", or something!

Problem is, to interpret the new layer (SSNA itself) you need to speak both languages. It speaks clearly to me, but I need some effort to make the ithers see.\u00a0IMHO the best SSN analyst is someone like @Noemi or @Amelia : social scientists with an inclination towards formal reasoning. The network science is, as of now, pretty basic, so it's much easier for them to grasp it than it would be for a network mathematician to teach herself the anthro and socio. Maybe later (if there is a later) the need for mathematical sophistication will increase.\n\nIn\u00a0a way, we are all children of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._Moreno\">Jacob Moreno</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociometry\">sociometrists</a> of the 1950s.

one challenge to solve or a prize or something , and not all changemakers who r also not mapped with the UNDP or other institutes didn't join because of different reasons ( being busy with their own challenges , didn't see this initiative going anywhere , don't trust the big institutions or even don't think about themselves as \"changemakers \" or underestimate their work , or for the language barrier which is still an issue ) BUT actually reaching some and networking will create a mass that attracts others and it is working as we can all see\u00a0 . but as mentioned its hard to spot and hard to evaluate as it is a naturally grown thing not a prize to win or a proposal to deliver.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-09 14:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.167024", "deleted_at":

This is a snippet of the early phase of CoreCareCollective\n\nQuestions that patients have don\u2019t always get answered- What can I do to keep my body in the best shape? What food is best to eat during treatment? These are a few of the many questions that require answers. In the standard 15 minute doctor visit it hard to dig deep and get these answers.\n\nIt all began with three words. \"You have cancer.\"\nThe most dreadful words anyone can hear. Denise Sliepen and Carry Hendrix heard those words.\n\nWhen Denise was diagnosed with in 2015 she had support from family and friends, but still found that they couldn't fully understand what she was going through. It was only by chance that Denise crossed paths with Carry Hendrix who was going through a similar diagnosis. An interaction at the gym brought these women to share the same space. Their friendship started and strengthened, and from that bond, it eventually led them to an idea of starting CoreCareCollective. An initiative to support the emotional and social needs of people living with cancer. This initiative promises to create a network of support dedicated to ensuring all people impacted by cancer are empowered by knowledge, strengthened by action and sustained by community.\n\nTheir story was shared in the [SCimPulse Blog](http://www.scimpulse.org/search?q=cORecarecollective), and we know it\u2019s necessary to share the \u201cWhy\u201d behind the initiative. Their intent is to provide a tool to support a collaborative dialogue between patients for sharing experiences and offering support.   As these early conversations are the backbone of any project. I had the opportunity to speak with Denise over a coffee and she shared with me the motivation behind their initiative.  <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c5338fd2970a6a0d32aba533e5345a8f45ce1f55.jpg\" width=\"459\" height=\"277\"> \n Carry Hendrix & Denise Sliepen (pictured above)\n\nA Recollection- I asked a few questions and this was the result of our conversation.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting Carry and getting to know one another and sharing the challenges and realizing they were similar including the internet for answers. We realized that information was scattered and more importantly we realized there must be others just like us. Searching for answers and support or exchange of conversation.\nIf something works for us, maybe it could help someone else who is in that unknown space. Sharing valuable information and treatment options are things that we would welcome. We thought we there must be others who were searching for answers as well. Nothing should be left up to chance. We decided that we wanted to help the next person who was affected and change the way people deal with cancer\u201d.\nI can recall an appointment at the hospital, where we were going to speak with a dietician for advice-which ended up not with insufficient information. We asked various questions, and shocked by the answers\u201d.\n\nWe both loved sports, maintained a healthy diet and wanted to retain as much of our daily lives as possible prior to diagnosis while undergoing treatment. So we went online and the journey began\u201d.\n\nWhat prompted the action?  \u201cWe wondered if all cancer patients struggled with the information provided on nutrition and exercise during treatment. We knew healthy eating and nutrition support can improve a patient's quality of life during cancer treatment. But we could not find a platform to discuss these issues, exchange experiences and see what works for someone else.  We all could learn from one another.  So we put our thoughts together and experiences so far and decided to start a community that could benefit from each other\u201d. \n\nWhat is the mission of CoreCareCollective? \u201cOur mission is to empower anyone who has been affected by cancer. To provide a space with the ability to connect and share personal experiences about cancer with others who understand. Our community would be 100% user-generated and engages all who are involved in a person\u2019s cancer fight: the survivors, fighters, supporters, and caregivers\u201d. \n\n\u201cEvery person who faces cancer has a story. This would be a space where the individual and collective voices impacted by cancer can be heard and shared to meet the social and emotional needs of patients, families, and caregivers throughout their journey\u201d. \n\nI had asked who else would be in collaboration, this was her response, and \u201cThe platform will honour the individual experience and create a community of understanding that extends to the entire health care delivery system\u201d.  \n\nWho do you want to reach? \u201cPeople around the world that want to share their experiences and sharing their strength\u201d. \n \n \nDenise and Carry have the vision to improve how cancer patients receive care and to collaborate and create a cancer support community that empowers people to take control of life before, during and after treatment. This support is crucial in allowing survivors, fighters and caregivers to share experiences with foods, treatment, side effects, long term effects and more.\n\nIt is their hope that every person and family battling cancer will reach out to the many others who want to help and get connected to a community that cares. Sharing the stories each with a promising and innovative approach to reinvent healthcare.\n\nI should end on a note with the essence of transparency, Denise and Carry, two strong and powerful women had their lives turned upside down decided to take their time and focus on feeling well and take an active role in improving their well-being. They decided to take a step back to move forward, at their own pace. So at present CoreCareCollective is waiting to be birthed. There are a plethora of platforms available to cancer patients and their families. But not all are created equally or intended to serve the same purpose.

Well done and super responsive. The platform I was working on was not focused only on that, local marketplace was just a part of it. Each producer had a profile on  which he could place and job offers, seasonal or permanent. Tell his story, have a promo video etc. It also gave a direct way of contacting producers who want such communication. Connection with google maps, showing the address of the producers. Recommended tours like cheese tour/wine tour or similar. Translated in 4 languages to start with.\n\nThe whole purpose was to bring closer the rural communities to urban population with a special focus on making it very easy for tourists or visitors from other parts of Croatia to get anything they need directly from the locals - eliminating the middle man. Also it would offer to tourists a great platform to discover all aspects of local life, not only products...cultural events, hidden gems etc. [Inspirock](https://www.inspirock.com/) does something similar in spirit.

So in total, it seems that researchers at least want the <em>option</em> to keep codings private, while not being opposed to selectively make them public as well.\n\nAfter much thinking, I think I found a good solution that respects this requirement. The coding interface would not be in the editor, but rather work with <a href=\"http://annotatorjs.org/\">Annotator</a> (which see for a live demo, by selecting some text there \u2026 it's quite nice). The storage would work using stand-off annotation technique: giving IDs to all words, and storing codings externally from the text by referencing the coded words' IDs. (More in the <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer-software-design/3905\">software design</a> wiki.) Still work in progress. For now, I'd like to know from you if word-level coding is sufficient?

I think that such a framework, however abstract and difficult to understand at this point and in this form, would be super useful in the context of evaluating a lot of projects that operate from European funds. This way the donors and the organizations both could better understand if their work contributes to actual positive change and lasting, thriving society.

We people often become selfish and forget generosity in that time when we have lots of desires to get different things. It is a human nature to have desires and to fulfill the desires people can do anything and this is what breaks the unity in people or it does not last long.\n\nI want to relate this thing with my life again. In my school we are divided to different groups and every time at least once a week or month we are assigned a project by our teachers. In my class, in the group that i belong too is so good, co-operative and has a great unity. And i am not telling it for sake, it is true that my group has the better unity that other groups. We work together in our group, we all have different views, ideas but our main aim or desire is always welfare of our group. But i can see some other groups fighting and having argument in small things because they all have lots of desires like they want to do less but get bigger reward not for group but for themselves and in the same group there are people who want to work but not too much and not of others part of work. They want their group to win and when group wins that is they also win. But some do not understand that in their groups and no unity.\n\nThis is the same in our society there are some people who are in unity though different they are, but others are like they just want themselves to be the winner and not others they all have desires not one but many. This breaks the unity.\n\nBut now to rebuild the same unity we had in time of disasters, we need to make people aware that are there desires unwanted, unnecessary or good. We can encourage people by being an example. Like if there is a competition in my school among groups and if my group shows an example of a united and co-operative group and our work is going well, other groups can learn from us and be united and settle down with quarrels. In the same way whole school then other schools, then again communities and at last the country. this may be one way.\n\nOther may be like, starting from myself, adjusting with people and teaching others the same. We can help others to adjust in our groups for unity. We have scout, biggest organization which also teaches to adjust and keep on the unity. So by all these we can maintain the unity and make others aware about importance and benefit of being united. And being human for benefit people can do that. As its a famous saying diamond cuts the diamond, greed cuts the greed. So this way we may maintain or make unity last long.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-23 01:32:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.779706", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 514, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9521], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36663, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 7061, "post_number": 3, "raw": "For today's call at 18:00 CET, @natalia_skoczylas can you moderate it as we discussed?  \n\nI tried again the usual hangout link and it seems to work: https://hangouts.google.com/call/in6dfwadzfdsldfynvnsatf75me\n\nJust in case, pinging @owen @gehan @woodbinehealth @alex_levene  and others joining!", "created_at": "2017-09-20 09:07:45.082703", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 09:08:02.177248", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 45, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12125, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 4267, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>agenda for the hangout </b>\n\nmy proposal is to do a round of testing before the call\n\nand for the hangout agenda this is what I have in mind , was going to send it to you Alberto and Luca to see what can be added before sending it as a reminder for the call,\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }\n\n</style>\n\nthe hangout could be structured over this main 3 questions\n\n1<sup>st</sup> what is working\n\nhow edgesense is beneficial in analysing the online \u201ccommunity\u201d for community members and moderators\n\nwhat are the immediate gains from looking through the edgesense interface\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2<sup>nd</sup> what's not (within the same scope)\n\nwhat kind of questions that were not answered by edgesense\n\nwhat are the info that takes more time( the non immediate gains) to conclude from edgesense\n\n\u00a0\n\n3<sup>rd</sup> what can be added\n\nwhat features addons can be added to have a more effective tool (regarding the 2nd what's not working question )\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-07 15:33:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.325315", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 346, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9896], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87924, "user_id": 1673, "topic_id": 15009, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I'm Thomas and I work as a Design Teacher and Media Producer in Lisbon.

Important instruction on handling wounds <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\n1. Wash it with water to remove any dust that may be sticking to the area. \n2. Immediately after this, it is important to cleanse the area with an antiseptic liquid (Dettol) that can prevent microorganisms from causing the wound to get infected.  \n3. Apply an antibacterial ointment to reduce the risk of infection (Betadine, Garamycin).\n\n\n## 5. Painkillers <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\nWhen you have a wound, there is often the possibility of a slight swelling, redness and pain in the area. Sometimes, you may develop a muscle spasm or sprain when you bend or stretch in an unnatural manner. In such cases too, there will be pain and inflammation. People who suffer from fever or a respiratory tract infection accompanied by cough and cold may also find they have a slight pain all over the body.Forall such situations, stock up on painkillers that are available over the counter (OTC) such as Paracetamol / Ibubrufen.\n\nApplying a cream to the affected area will help you get better relief more quickly. (ex. Reparil Gel).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Please keep updating!**", "created_at": "2018-01-24 09:23:48.026371", "updated_at": "2018-02-13 14:10:57.687110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1004, "wiki": true, "reads": 22, "score": 299.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4286, 3791, 4, 1935, 4267], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38178, "user_id": 3973, "topic_id": 7063, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I'm looking forward to learning more about your work as well -- and better understanding the relations between street / herbal / \"traditional\" medicine and medical / synthetic / \"modern\" medicine", "created_at": "2017-10-12 17:50:17.637682", "updated_at": "2017-10-12 17:50:17.637682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [36964], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12179, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2651, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Great idea about the interviews..</b>\n\nHi Nino,\n\n<span>I'm very excited about your idea of getting in touch with people and interviewing them.

Find the writeup and subsequent discussion [here](/t/13183).*\n\nSeveral of the smartest people we know in the Net activism space are worried. SARS-CoV-2 will be defeated, at some point; but it might leave behind new limitations to civil liberties and privacy. We have had two decades of [consumer surveillance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html); and at least one decade of the inter-governmental panopticon we learned about through [Edward Snowden's revelations](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/759833071/in-permanent-record-edward-snowden-makes-his-case-against-mass-surveillance). The right to privacy online has been tenuous at best for quite a while, but that encroachment has not, so far, directly curtailed basic civil liberties. \n\nUntil COVID-19 hit. Suddenly everyone is coding mobile apps to track who has been in touch with whom. There are reports of dodgy companies like Palantir and Clearview AI collaborating with major governments on digital tools to monitor and contain contagion. And, in the rush to beat the pandemic: a formidable social pressure is mounting to \"just do what we are told\". At the same time, many activists are trying to mount less invasive solutions; disposable identities that track one's health status during an outbreak and then are destroyed; or opt-in digital commons. \n\nWhich freedoms are we really risking? What do we stand to gain in return? \n\n**We organize a community listening session on Thursday April 9th at 17.00 CEST**, in the context of [IOT Day](https://www.iotday.org/). \n\n### Format & practical information\n\n* Full information sheet: **https://bit.ly/SurveillancePandemic**\n* A Zoom meeting (ironic, I know \u2013 we are looking into alternatives, but we have no time to properly test before qe go live). **[Click here to join the meeting](https://zoom.us/j/566856233) starting 16.45 on Thursday April 9th.**\n* **Not a panel, an open, moderated discussion**. A moderator will give the floor to people who want to contribute something. Some have already volunteered (see list below, updated continuously). If you want to share your point of view, use the call's chat to let us know, and the moderator will give you the floor. If you have a question to ask the speaker, ask it in the chat (better) or let us know you want to ask a question. Questions are taken before we move on to the next speaker.\n* **We commit to doing a proper writeup of the result** (aka \"documentation, or it didn't happen\"). Edgeryders also deploys its team of ethnographers for participant observation and note-taking. \n\n* **Everyone welcome**. Below there is a list of the people who have agreed to show up. If you are coming too, we are happy to put you on it. If you prefer not to be on the list, that's OK too. \n* **Please note we aim to publish the content of the conversation as public knowledge, available to activists and scholars**. However, this will happen through writeups by people in Edgeryders. We will not record the call, and event the writeups will not mention any names.\n\n### Confirmed at the time of writing \u2013 check back for updates\n\nThis is a list of people who confirmed their attendance, not a panel.

In this session, we sought to reflect on the systems at play in our worlds that play a role in shaping our reproductive destiny.  We noted how the ancient practice of choosing one's reproductive destiny has become so foreign.  Due to the multitude of entities invested (even only partially) in controlling a woman's reproduction -- pharmaceutical companies, local/state/national governments (laws!!), schools, religious bodies, culture, husbands, fathers, doctors, teachers, etc -- it is a daunting task to seek autonomy.  The interplay between doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and governments alone should make any one skeptical of the treatment they are receiving.  But is there even an alternative?  As a group, we reflected on our own infrastructure related to our reproductive health -- do we trust the entities at play?  For some, there are strict laws preventing abortion, for example.  For others, the laws were more lenient but came with a list of caveats.  Who can you trust and what are your options?  Rather than fighting all of these powers at play, we realize we can arm ourselves with knowledge.  Knowing our own bodies that we are typically so alienated from, is the first step towards sovereignty.  We also must understand our own needs as individuals and as communities.  We found commonalities between stories shared within the group (from around the world), but so much is different.  Through the discussion we realized that the work must be done at a the hyper-local level because context matters.

That being said, I understand why you had to do so. Amelia's presence is crucial for this ethno-session to be fruitful.\n\nSo here is how we fix things. That October week is a hectic one for me. I have to be on a PhD jury in Paris, and I give an invited talk in La Rochelle two days later. Being in Brussels until Saturday is just not possible (not mentioning until Sunday!).\n\nConsequently, we have decided with Jason that he would be the one running the show with Amelia. I'll simply skip the event and travel back home earlier. This will also save me to cancel courses and reschedule them later -- this is always quite a hassle, because of schedule clashes between mine and that of students and lack of available classrooms ...\n\nGuy", "created_at": "2017-09-20 09:41:46.695302", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 09:41:46.695302", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 193, "wiki": false, "reads": 59, "score": 71.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85361, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14583, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-10-20 08:04:36.729151", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 08:04:36.729151", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36685, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7105, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Before I get into a more public musing on the subject, let me do a brief reality check.  My specialty, if you want to call it that, is community building, nurturing and sustenance.  This is for online and offline environments, and in our case, hybrids of the two.  The WB is more interested in the online part of that, but much of our interaction in the OV/MENA/Reef universe has to do with the generally more complicated and, frankly, difficult offline live/work realities.  In service of our overall goals, I split my presentations into one that emphasizes the offline environment and one that really focuses on online community management.\n\nAs we select out Fellows and do the actual building of the OV scenes in the respective countries, am I correct in thinking that Fellows, or someone designated for the online role, will be responsible for managing the online community aspects of their particular OV/Reef?  And if so, will some subset of the people who are likely to be interested in my overall community talk need to understand the finer points of online community management?  Because I suspect that if, during the 1.5 hour \u201cBuilding Healthy and Productive Online/Offline Communities,\u201dI spend too much time on the online aspects, some will think, \u201cwhy do I need to know all this?\u201d\n\nSo perhaps, a second session during the Freestyle section would be useful for those who really need to know more about how to handle themselves when they are in an online community management position.  Or does that apply to all of them?  I am unclear on this part.  We have two Fellows so far, both super talented and bright and capable who are already quite worldly.  And we have decided to sort of size up others when we are there together.\n\nSo, what do you think about the first session touching on important themes of online community, and having a second session for those (probably few) who really want and need to dig deeper into it?", "created_at": "2017-09-20 14:07:46.614111", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 14:07:46.614111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 340, "wiki": false, "reads": 53, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36397, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7106, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"Heba, post:2, topic:7106\"]\neveryone is despairing and civil society is shrinking\n[/quote]\n\nI have seen this expressed elsewhere in this project :worried:\n\n@Abdelwahab I am curious about the ULC.

Rather, it\u2019s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. [\u2026] Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the Cognitive Revolution.[\u2026]\n\nYou will never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. But why is it important? [\u2026] fiction enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. [\u2026] Myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.\u201d\n\nProbably Harari is an extrovert and there are bias at work here, because I totally agree with your point that this ability of abstraction gave us also science that is doesn\u2019t have to be social in order to evolve (or maybe yes? see the scientific method).\n\nAnother thought that your comment sparked is this: maybe I like to be with other people also because I found very helpful to ask questions as a shortcut to knowledge, point of view and stories. I can learn a lot from books as well..if I read Madame Bovary I will learn a lot and probably very deeply, but the fact that with humans I can follow up and we can have an exchange, it is much faster but probably less deep.

The display would indicate if it's ok for one more person or animal to go on the bridge, or not.\n\nA robust mechanical solution with a mechanical display could be good, but might also be much more expensive due to the need of measuring high tensions mechanically. An electronic solution (with photovoltaics for power) would be much cheaper, as it could measure tension indirectly, for example via oscillation (similarly to a guitar string: higher pitch means higher tension). Since the bridge can still be used when the load meter breaks, I think this would be the better solution.\n\nSuch an electronic load meter (if it really solves an issue with wire bridges) could be a marketable product because it can be added to the many existing wire bridges in Nepal and other countries. We would develop it as an open source project, and it can be produced by a small company (for example one starting inside an OpenVillage house). This way might even open a way of funding wire bridges in Nepal: we'd partner with an NGO specializing in wire bridges, developing the open source load meter device for them in exchange for getting (say) five wire bridges built in Karnali.", "created_at": "2017-10-08 19:52:15.414876", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 19:52:15.414876", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 312, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 70.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [36520], "is_reply_to": [36520], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27847, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 3133, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Veggie food, yes i!</b>\n\nWhat a great initiative!

We at Edgeryders organized an AMA with him to learn more about the case. This post summarizes the discussion we had during the AMA. The full discussion is [above it](/t/14766/1). \n\nAt the end of the post, you will find a list of questions raised by the AMA, but left without an answer. Can you help us answer them?\n\n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:1, topic:14766\"]\nIn 2014, the Dutch government introduced a legislation approving the use of a risk scoring algorithm to detect welfare fraud. This system, called System Risk Indication (SyRI), pools together data from various government agencies to calculate the likelihood of committing welfare or tax fraud. The UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights has described governments\u2019 use of similar systems as \u201c[digital welfare states ](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A_74_48037_AdvanceUneditedVersion.docx)\u201d and condemned them for their lack of transparency and oversight, and discriminatory impacts. In the case of SyRI, we discovered that the system used neighbourhood data to profile against migrant and poor communities.\n\nWith a coalition of privacy organisations, we challenged SyRI on grounds of privacy and equality violations. Earlier this year, the Dutch court found SyRI to be unlawful and ordered its immediate halt. You can read more [here ](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/) and [here ](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2020:1878).\n[/quote]\n\n## Why the algorithm was deemed to be unfair?\n\nThe court observed that SyRI was not comprehensively sweeping the Dutch society. Rather, the government aimed it at poor districts. \n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:17, topic:14766\"]\nThe SyRI system was used in \u2018SyRI-projects\u2019. These projects were targeted at specific neighborhoods that were considered \u2018problem districts\u2019. Therefore, the profiling that took place in SyRI mostly affected groups with a lower socio-economic status and or minority / immigration background.\n[/quote]\n\nIn his book [Radicalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalized_(Doctorow_book)),  Cory Doctorow has a great explanation of why AI trained on law enforcement data tend to be biased: \n\n> \"Because cops only find crime where they look for it. If you make every Black person you see turn out their pockets, you will find every knife and every dime-baggie that any Black person carries, but that doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether Black people are especially prone to carrying knives or drugs, especially when cops make quota by carrying around a little something to plant if need be.\"\n>\n>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, we know that Black people are more likely to be arrested for stuff that white people get a pass on, like \u2018blocking public sidewalks.\u2019 White guys who stop outside their buildings to have a smoke or just think about their workdays don\u2019t get told to move along, or get ticketed, or get searched. Black guys do. So any neighborhood with Black guys in it will look like it\u2019s got an epidemic of sidewalk-blocking, but it really has an epidemic of overpolicing.\"\n\n## \"It mat be unfair, but it works\". Or?\n\nWe had an interesting discussion about the effectiveness of SyRI. The court itself admitted that \n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:12, topic:14766\"]\n>There are predictive algorithms which are fairly accurate in predicting the outcome of a court case.\n\n[...] So, it\u2019s bad to profile people, but it works pretty well.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"katejsim, post:25, topic:14766\"]\nI\u2019m curious what you @antonekker think about *whether* individuals\u2019 likelihood of committing welfare fraud can be predicted from data collected in government records.\n[/quote]\n\nSuch effective prediction is probably unadmissible in court, because it is not based on \"substantive merits of the case\", but rather on observable variables that correlate statistically with those substantive merits. We discovered that this effectiveness was not neutral, but deployed disproportionately against disadvantaged citizens in another dimension: \n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:38, topic:14766\"]\nOne of SyRI\u2019s stated goals is to find \u201ctax fraud.\u201d Tax fraud, as a category involves every strata of income and society.\n[/quote]\n\nIf you train an algorithm to maximize potential *tax* fraud, it will almost certainly zero in on rich people. This is simply a feature of the mathematical landscape: the higher your gross income, the higher your potential for tax fraud. \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:45, topic:14766\"]\nThe expected value of catching an offender correlates positively with the income of the people being searched. I guess if you train an AI on the sums claimed back, rather than on the number of offenses, it will zero in on the rich folks. :smiley:\n[/quote]\n\nMoreover, if you trained the whole of SyRI to maximize the overall monetary value to the state (social welfare detection fraud + tax fraud) it would probably still target the rich, because\n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:43, topic:14766\"]\nif you catch one rich person for tax evasion, that might be equal to ten cases of social security fraud.\n[/quote]\n\n## Even if it works in the aggregate, it can still be very bad for individuals\n\nAIs are trained on datasets, and evaluated on how well they perform *on average*. They do not need to be accurate, they just need to be a bit more accurate than the alternative. In machine learning, the alternative is normally standardized to random selection. To be useful to the Dutch state, SyRI only need to detect more fraud than checking citizens at random. That's a low bar to clear.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:36, topic:14766\"]\nIf we are happy with being \u201cgood\u201d (outperforming randomness) at the aggregate level, we might need very little data. For example, in predicting the outcome of football matches, the simplest model \u201cthe home team always wins\u201d does (a little) better than random. Hal Varian (Google\u2019s chief economist) a few years ago went on record saying \u201cif you have 99% correlation, who cares about causation\u201d, or something like that. But this extra performance only applies to predicting a whole lot of football matches (the population), while being useless if you are trying to predict one match in particular.\n\nI think @katejsim worries that prejudices outperform randomness. *If you don\u2019t care about fairness and the rights of the individual* , you could indeed predict that the poorer neighbors would have more social welfare fraud than rich ones. But this would come at the expense of treating poorer individuals fairly, and, unlike with football matches, it would end up reinforcing the conditions that force those people to apply for welfare in the first place.\n[/quote]\n\nThe thing is, the consequences of a SyRI error could be dire for a person. Defending yourself against allegations of fraud costs time and effort, and often money. \n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:37, topic:14766\"]\naking the possible consequences for citizens in account, the predictions should actually be much better than just \u2018good\u2019. If 2% procent of the outcomes are wrong, this is already effecting a large number of people.\n\nThis raises the question if decisions by government about fraud can ever be left to algorithms alone. Maybe, human interference should be mandatory.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"katejsim, post:40, topic:14766\"]\nFalse positives means that people who need welfare benefits don\u2019t receive them.\n[/quote]\n\n## Open questions\n\nThe AMA session raised more question than we could address in one hour. Here's a stab at listing the remaining loose ends. Do you have any information or want to share an opinion about any of them?\n\n### 1. Standards for how to prevent bias and discrimination\n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:21, topic:14766\"]\ncertain aspects of algorithmic decision might be addressed in a way that resembles the \u2018open source approach\u2019. I\u2019m thinking about standards for how to prevent bias and discrimination, how to assess the impact of algorithms and how to explain the outcomes. Such standards might be assessed and improved within the public domain. There are many different societal contexts and use cases that would have to be addressed, for instance financial sector, automotive, health care, et.\n\nDoes that seem plausible to you?\n[/quote]\n\n### 2. A trustmark for AI\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:3, topic:14766\"]\nAt the NGI Forum last year, Nesta hosted [a discussion on a potential \u201cNGI Trustmark\u201d](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-trustmark-notes-from-ngi-forum-workshop/10883/4) for AI. [...] How do you think this could work in practice? And is a Trustmark a good idea, or is it a waste of effort? \n\nAnother idea [...]: that any AI trained on public data or data acquired in a public setting must be released to the public, by EU law. What do you think about that proposal? \n[/quote]\n\n### 3. European-level protection against AI abuse by government\n\n[quote=\"Seamus_Montgomery, post:26, topic:14766\"]\nI was wondering if you have any thoughts on what could be proposed in terms of policy at the European level to protect EU citizens against similar infringements of privacy rights by their own governments.\n[/quote]\n\n### 4. \"They keep coming\"\n\nThe SyRI case is a bit special, in that one of the parties was the Dutch state. The state is subject to the law... but, unlike the NGOs on the other side of the case, it also makes its own laws. So, it does not have to win in a court battle; another way to win is to simply change the law. \n\nGiven all this, can human rights activists really win these battles in the long run? If not, what else can be done?\n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:18, topic:14766\"]\nI\u2019m quite sure that the government will try to make adjustments to carry on with similar projects. After the judgment was given, the Dutch State decided not to appeal it. At first, my clients were very surprised. However, shortly after that, the government introduced a new legislative proposal that provides a general framework for SyRI like systems. We call it \u2018Super SyRI\u2019.\n\nUnder the new law, risk profiling technologies can be introduced in several domains. The law only provides a general framework. Specific requirements will be set in by ministerial decree, which by itself is problematic from a constitutional perspective.\n[/quote]", "created_at": "2020-11-16 19:27:24.804785", "updated_at": "2020-11-16 21:07:43.517620", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1704, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 467.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 14, "quotes_posts": [86417, 86645, 86484, 86655, 86668, 86675, 86673, 86666, 86667, 86670, 86650, 86428, 86656, 86647], "is_reply_to": [86417, 86645, 86484, 86655, 86668, 86675, 86673, 86666, 86667, 86670, 86650, 86428, 86656, 86647], "is_liked_by": [8, 4934, 5059], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19795, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1256, "post_number": 6, "raw": "'<em>Lying transparently</em>', houl\u00e0, I haven't tried that trick yet!\n\n<span><span>SUPPORT. </span></span><span><span>Is the word that</span> <span>comes to my mind</span>, <span>when I</span> <span>listen to you</span> <span>talk about your story.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>I</span><span> find</span> <span>very beautiful this ability</span> of yours <span>to</span> <span>surround yourself</span> with l<span>oving, caring</span> <span>people</span></span>.

The fast-track life has absorbed us into its rush, dragging us from one location to another, to fulfil task after the other, in what seems to be an endless cycle, making us worried, anxious, and lonesome. Human interaction has faded in a world of capital, with businesses and careers fostering competition and individualism, perhaps as modern survival-of-the-fittest tactics. And a cemented invasion of natural spaces further hinders spontaneous human connection. \n\n   With a history of wars and conflicts, in a country swirling in political corruption, economic regression and social unease \u2013 to say the least -, we persist to struggle for reasonable peace, stability, and possible change. Accumulations of rivalry constructed great walls of separation between individuals from same or different generations, regions, and cultures, distancing people even farther apart. \n\n   From a group of friends living in villages of Aley El Ghareb (Shahhar) region of Mount-Lebanon, Lebanon, coming from similar cultural contexts, carrying diverse visions and interests in life, our project gently developed.  An appreciation of art, a longing for genuine human interaction, and a curiosity to debate social and cultural matters of our country and the world, are elements that built our common ground towards a simple yet unpreceded concept for a joint project.\n\n   Since it is our right to enjoy open public spaces, and since it\u2019s everyone\u2019s right to have access to artworks with purpose, we decided to screen movies, an approachable form of art by most people, that convey certain social realities in a green public space in the villages of the area of Mount Lebanon, as a start.\n\n   We allow our followers on Facebook to vote for a movie out of three different options of a mutual theme, and the selected movie is screened. This screening takes place in a new public space every other Wednesday, where entrance is free and popcorn is offered (gratuitement!).  We only ask people to bring their matts and cushions along with some enthusiasm for a friendly gathering.

People became more conscious about mafia penetrion in our area.\n\nI really would like to talk with you to organize an \"AntimafiaCamp\" next fall in Italy, to support the antimafia movement and create a network of people using technology and innovative ways to empower themselves and each of us against mafia and corruption.\n\nLooking forward to meet you at the conference in the next days :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-12 19:00:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.359741", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 228, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35658, "user_id": 3826, "topic_id": 6815, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\n\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b \u064a\u0627 \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0635 ... \u0627\u062d\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0649 \u0648 \u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0645\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0631\u0642 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0627\u064b ... \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0627\u064a\u0634\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u0623\u0643\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u062a\u0627 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0629 \u0648 \u062f\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u062e\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0646\u0633\u0628\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0623\u063a\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u062a\u0632\u0648\u062f \u062a\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u0623\u0643\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0639 \u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0647\u064a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0649 \u0642\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648 \u0633\u0639\u0631\u0647 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u0641\u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0644 \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629 \u0632\u0649 \u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u062a \u0645\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u062a\u0635\u063a\u0631 \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0646\u064a\u0639 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0644 \n\n\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0645\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u0639 \u0632\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0648 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0649 \u0648\u0631\u0634\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0636\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0646\u0629 ... \u0647\u0648 \u0637\u0628\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0634 \u062a\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0643\u0645\u0649 \u0643\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0623\u0633\u0627\u0633\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\n[/text-direction]\n\nfood flow in El-Gouna (Mousa,Heba;

And tents for services and for shelter. There are separate shelters and donation stations for pets.

There are posters all over with cards pens and pins to sent messages of hope and strength. The local schools are still closed so the parks are full of children all day. There have been thunderstorms every night. The people unharmed are scared. For many young people it is the first time they faced death and it changes them. Some have already moved away.

Najve\u0107i broj njih se poljoprivredom bavi na tradicionalniji na\u010din, koji podrazumeva izla\u017eenje na kraj sa prirodom i prirodnim pojavama: poplavama, \u0161teto\u010dinama itd. Poljoprivreda je spora, ona ne mo\u017ee biti brza ako povr\u0107e ne gajite u plasteniku. Pa\u017eljivo: soju, pasulj ili p\u0161enicu (kao osnovni sastojak na\u0161e ishrane) ne mo\u017eete gajiti u plasteniku. Ideja da se gajenjem u plastenicima mo\u017ee prehraniti \u010ditav svet je mit.\n\nKada je pao Berlinski zid, u odre\u0111enim isto\u010dnoevropskim zemljama se javila ideja da se velike dr\u017eavne zadruge preobraze u velika preduze\u0107a: u \u010ce\u0161koj Republici, Slova\u010dkoj, Ma\u0111arskoj. Oni imaju ogromna gazdinstva koja su, na neki na\u010din, nasledili. Ali je u Poljskoj i Rumuniji situacija bila suprotna: kada sam posetio Klu\u017e pre deset godina, razgovarao sam sa profesorom koji ka\u017ee da pri agrarnoj reformi svaki Rumun \u017eeli svoju parcelu sa zemljom, \u0161to je nemogu\u0107e jer su bile suvi\u0161e rascepkane. U tim zemljama postoje velike firme \u2013 koje nisu lo\u0161e \u2013 ali i male, koje \u017eele da prona\u0111u nove puteve i da sami ne\u0161to preduzmu \u2013 na primer, sreo sam ov\u010dare koji su na\u0161li na\u010din da mleko i druge proizvode prodaju mesnim supermarketima. A postoji i ose\u0107aj nostalgije.\n\nMe\u0111utim, kada se mladi poljoprivrednici prihvate dela, u stanju su da nostalgiju preobraze u ne\u0161to dobro.\n\n### Da li su za podr\u0161ku inovacijama u poljoprivredi neophodne javne ili privatne strukture?\n\nTradicionalno, inovacije nastupaju kroz izu\u010davanje u laboratoriji, nakon \u010dega istra\u017eiva\u010di izlaze na teren kako bi poljoprivrednicima pokazali \u0161ta mogu da promene. Posle \u201eZelene revolucije\u201c je do\u0161lo do kolapsa ovog na\u010dela na Zapadu, gde hrana vi\u0161e nije pitanje bezbednosti i gde se razmi\u0161lja o novim stvarima. U pru\u017eanju izvora finansiranja, privatne kompanije su zamenile javni sektor, \u0161to ba\u0161 i nije dobro \u2013 uz javno finansiranje se mo\u017eete baviti ne\u010dim na du\u017ei rok i podneti teret pitanja o ekolo\u0161kom i dru\u0161tvenom blagostanju. U svetu privatnih kompanija, one \u017eele povra\u0107aj ulaganja i nije im posao da razmi\u0161ljaju u socijalnim kategorijama.\n\nEvropska Unija se trudi da finansira i, po principu \u201eodozdo navi\u0161e\u201c, poma\u017ee operativne grupe u [Evropskom inovativnom partnerstvu u poljoprivredi (EIP AGRI)](https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/european-innovation-partnership-agricultural). Ove grupe su zami\u0161ljene kao raznorodne i okupljaju poljoprivrednike, nevladine organizacije i istra\u017eiva\u010de. \u010cak i uz podr\u0161ku javnog sektora, kod ustanovljenih re\u0161enja se pojavljuju problemi kada ih treba primeniti u ve\u0107oj razmeri i na drugim mestima.\n\nU ovom trenutku, pitanje podr\u0161ke javnog sektora nije toliko u davanju novca, koliko u me\u0111usobnom povezivanju ovih projekata. Mo\u017eete imate sajt sa stotinama ili hiljadama projekata, ali ko \u0107e povezati konce? Ako javni sektor to ne u\u010dini, mora\u0107e neko drugi.\n\nTokom vebinara, svi prisutni \u0107e izneti iskustva o svom projektu i postavljati pitanja na\u0161em gostu i drugim u\u010desnicima. \u017delimo da zajedno nau\u010dimo slede\u0107e:\n\n* Kako se lokalne inicijative bore sa efektima pandemije virusa Kovid-19?\n* Da li vam lokalna samouprava poma\u017ee u radu ili ne, i kako;\n* Koje su glavne prepreke sa kojima se suo\u010dava va\u0161 projekat ili preduze\u0107e?\n* Koji oblici saradnje su mogu\u0107i izme\u0111u poljoprivrednika i lokalnih proizvo\u0111a\u010da, prehrambenih zadruga i platformi za odr\u017eiviju lokalnu trgovinu i zajednice?\n\n### Gost vebinara:\n**An\u0111elo di Mambro** (Angelo di Mambro) je novinar koji se intenzivnije po\u010deo baviti poljoprivredom i hranom 2008. godine, posle skoka cena prehrambene robe na globalnom nivou.

Not only is Slack the most sluggish, inefficient and bloated of the six web-based chat tools that I have open all the time. It is also not open source, and not frictionless for people who are not on the platform. Because they need an account on our Slack (let\u2019s say [edgeryders.slack.com](http://edgeryders.slack.com)), even if they already have one or more other Slack accounts. And if they are going to need a new account anyway, they could just as well have made one on our Discourse platform.\n[/quote]\n\nTotally agree -- we were lamenting that Slack is the only chat program set up to integrate fully with Discourse right now since it's our least favourite haha. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:3, topic:14748\"]\nAlso I think that we should look for a more general solution than \u201cjust\u201d being able to post Slack transcripts to Discourse. It should be applicable, with little work, to any chat tool; of which we use several already. For example, when community managers hold a webinar in Zoom or Google Meet, the chat among the audience might contain relevant content, and we\u2019d want an edited transcript on Discourse.\n[/quote]\n\nAlso totally agree with this. The funding, as you say, is the million dollar question. So we need to find 4000 EUR for this? \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:3, topic:14748\"]\n* otably, the transcript will use the usual Discourse quote formatting to attribute chat messages to users (such as `[quote=\"username\"]\u2026[/quote]` ). It will *not* create one Discourse post for every chat message. Usernames would correspond to Discourse usernames where a mapping has been provided, and otherwise would use a special prefix such as `chatuser_` .Posting each chat message as a Discourse post is not a good idea because Discourse posts are meant to be longer. Many short chat messages will lead to a lot of notification spam, and also many users would have to be created who would never come and post anything in person on Discourse, thus cluttering the database.\n* The user posting the transcript can edit the draft at will (shortening, fixing spelling and grammar, editing out personal data etc.) and would then post this as a new topic to Discourse. It can serve as a conversation starter, allowing other Discourse users to add their own posts as usual.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is the main thing we'll have to work out -- because ideally we do have unique users for each chat post, or something along those lines (maybe instead, an aggregation of every message sent by a single user? Or not auto-creating users due to this database cluttering? Will have to think about it). I'm interested in what coding a chat would look like, because my theory is that you'll have shorter messages with only two or three codes (and some not coded) but more messages, so still an ability to track which concepts co-occur most. \n\nOne big block of text is very bad for ethnographic coding, because then everything co-occurs with everything else and we lose meaning AND we lose the social element (who is saying things) --  so having it all in one big Discourse post isn't ideal. Definitely would defeat the purpose of doing this in the first place from an ethno coding perspective. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:3, topic:14748\"]\nAs a nice side effect, this solution will also enable the ethnographic coding of video call transcripts. It\u2019s just about manually creating a post made from quotes, in analogy to what the chat transcript importer would generate.\n[/quote]\n\nGreat!", "created_at": "2020-11-08 12:24:42.869441", "updated_at": "2020-11-08 12:25:30.609210", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 616, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [86407], "is_reply_to": [86407], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38350, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 7170, "post_number": 91, "raw": "I hear you @anique.vered, while I only needed one name and OK for the booklet, you two can lead in practice and manage things with @natalia_skoczylas, Alex and co.

From the perspective of ethnographic coding, the solution I proposed above *will* use unique users for each chat user. Just that these are not Discourse users in all cases (only where a mapping is provided). Instead, these are users in an additional Open Ethnographer user table. These users would be automatically identified by the handles they use in the chat transcript.\n\nThis does not contradict current coding practices, but extends them. So whenever in the future an ethnographer codes a quote of another user (using the `[quote=\"username\"]\u2026[/quote]` syntax), that code will be attributed to the quoted user, not the quoting one.

In this respect being in Matera isn't a necessity to any of the roles but rather a preference. If I were able though, I'd visit Matera once a month. For the most part this team will operate remotely. We've just started regular community calls again, first summary here:\u00a0<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/quick-summary-of-unmonastery-community-call-1\">/t/unmonastery/315/quick-summary-of-unmonastery-community-call-1</a>\u00a0\n\nIf the desire is to facilitate the co-design process, since you've highlighted this as your area of specialism, I think there would definitely be a need to visit Matera at least a couple of times in the lead up.\u00a0\n\nThe decision making process. As with EdgeRyders, the philosophy is this; the one that does the work, is one that makes the decisions. In order for that to function\u00a0transparency and discussion with peers is needed to ensure we can work together effectively. You won't though need to ask for permission.

This topic is to discuss what extensions to that basic journal feature are needed, if any.\n\nInitial collection of ideas I have in mind for that already:\n\n1. **Automating comment for status and field changes:** A custom plugin could post these comments whenever a user updates the `status-*` tag or a field in the first post. The comment thread would then closely resemble how it looked in the Drupal version. It can be implemented with inspirations from the Discourse core \"discoursebot\" user. In addition, it would allow us to switch to a unified mode of updating a journal: simply edit fields in its first post, which would be a wiki. No strikethrough, no `status-*` tag editing etc.. The bot would post a comment about the change and who made it, and also adapt the `status-*` tag on its own. Potentially, BBCode tags like `[status]\u2026[/status]` would be introduced in the topic template to simplify this task for the software.\n\n2. **Tag for reuse candidates:** To mark projects that are esp. promising for reusing / recycling them, we might want to introduce a separate tag that would be assigned in addition to \"`project-dropped`\". Such as \"`journaltag-reusable`\".\n\n3. **Tag for crisis mode:** As a simpler replacement for the former \"Attention needs\" field in the Drupal version, we might introduce a tag `journaltag-crisismode`. Or something less strong to indicate projects that need special attention to be successful. Can be further emphasized with an icon in front of the title, like one of :bangbang: :triangular_flag_on_post: :fire: :bomb:. (The usual named codes like `:fire:` also work in the title.)\n\n4. **Bringing back the \"Attention needs\" field:** Maybe simply not needed, as there is a strong correlation with \"project state\". In the Drupal based system, it encoded the level of care with which the project must currently be handled. If you are waiting for the client to react to a proposal it might be low (\"awareness\"); if the client is waiting for you to make a proposal, or if the project is active, it might be higher (\"management: attentive\"). In general, \"awareness\" denotes a passive state, \"management\" an active one.\n\n5. **Profect lifeline diagram:** Add a diagram to a pinned topic in category \"[Project Journals](/c/docs/journals)\", or to a custom admin backend page, that shows the lifeline of every project as it changes its status over time. Status changes would be tracked from post revisions. Embedding the diagram into a Discourse topic is somewhat complicated but possible via a third-party diagramming web platform and custom OneBox embeddings \u2013 see [this discussion](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/94).\n\n6. **Tag for project manager:** By assigning tags like `manager-matthias` and changing them depending on who is project manager, we would (1) provide everyone the option to have an overview of the projects they are managing by visiting the corresponding tag page, (2) unify how field values are changed: by tag, not by editing a wiki. The wiki would only contain things that don't change (client, client contact info).", "created_at": "2017-09-26 17:34:07.405618", "updated_at": "2017-09-27 00:35:56.704684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 535, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37197, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 7193, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Thanks for raising this issue @unknown_author I always have the same doubts for the potential scenarios that could happen.\n\nwas just discussing with a friend that there is this old building for a school in Downtown Cairo that I have never seen used since I was a little kid, I would love to reuse it and do some projects there involving the mechanics and cafes nearby but it is very tricky not to be involved in the process of [gentrifying downtown cairo](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2015/10/29/feature/politics/the-changing-face-of-downtown/) anyway that's off topic and can't be realized now anyways. \n\nI believe that we can't control the whole process but we what we can do is build real ties with the locals and gain mutual trust so we can help also as @johncoate was saying without bringing the uneeded investments to the town. \n \n[quote=\"unknown_author, post:1, topic:7193\"]\nI spend 3 hours yesterday breaking argane nutshell with my new ''mom'', get the water from the fountain with my new brother (rouhya) shopping fish from essaouira with the crew...etc...I m talking to alot of people and I see so much potential to keep this place healthy, but it's gonna be hard.\n[/quote]\n\nthat's a start, I believe it also depends on the people who will go and live there, games could help them to get involved, other important thing is the language, and Moroccan people getting involved from our side. \n\neven starting learning the language is a sign and builds trust, so organizing lessons that local people can teach us their local language, for me is a good point to start longer deeper collaboration. \nsharing food, activities ( surfing or any kind of sport or game ) involving them in the festival and other stuff, working will come naturally then.", "created_at": "2017-09-29 13:14:25.693726", "updated_at": "2018-03-09 19:53:44.126563", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 312, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [37021], "is_reply_to": [37021], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84695, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14555, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@Nadia for this week's newsletter (internal) I focused on the findings of the ethnography study. \n\n@IvanC", "created_at": "2020-10-09 14:13:41.815937", "updated_at": "2020-10-09 14:13:41.815937", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78726, "user_id": 5604, "topic_id": 9766, "post_number": 34, "raw": "And we start it as Blue Ocean solution: for currently under-served groups, by providing them TRIPLE-A books (Accessible, Affordable, Available), with 'digital twins' of contents - adjusted & adjustable in real time - to the unique user:\n- VIP make 20% of population, currently served only ca. 1% (by audio books for VIP\n- immigrants (books at non-local languages are rare), elderly people (digitally illiterate) who need SPECIALIZED books in ONE UNIQUE copy each, like special fonts for dyslexic/ Large Print Books.\nAnd (referring to Copyright question) our strongest feature is ISP's / Copyright protection & enhanced support: see Public Libraries Testimonials, slide 8 https://bit.ly/oeBook4Espoo", "created_at": "2020-06-11 08:05:16.506442", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 08:05:16.506442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 105, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78717], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23056, "user_id": 119, "topic_id": 5187, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Hmmm</b>\n\nOK, so the walk is actually a methodology in itself.

Les designers r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 des commandes dont les cons\u00e9quences parfois peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9fastes. Ils ont toujours une part de responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils doivent assumer car c\u2019est le r\u00f4le du designer de suivre ou d\u2019influencer les projets qu\u2019il r\u00e9alise.

Do you worry about this when using Scuttlebutt? How can we make these peculiarities of decentralized technologies visible without scaring people off?\n[/quote]\n\nThis touches upon an aspect I worry about in regards to scuttlebutt as well yet is of a different kind. In your example you mention being faced with data you would rather not partake in, I have found that blocking does indeed hinder most forms of data sharing which I would like to avoid. The one case i have witnessed a lot of discussion around is the same as with facebook/instagram of the \"annoying uncle/aunt syndrome\", in which one has a social obligation to not block the individual yet would rather not see the unfiltered spouting on their feed. Facebook/instagram has solved this by simply opening up for \"opting out\" of seeing their content in your feed. This would be simple to implement on the application layer of SSB for example. \n\nOn the other hand, speaking of hops and the spread of data, comparing the amount of privacy (in the sense of who has access to your data) SSB is by far more private than current internet standards and platforms. This ties into the core issue of all kinds of flat-structure tools/platforms used for private communication, that they can easily be used for hiding shady information as well, something one inevitably has to take a stance on. \n\nIn regards to designing for communicating privacy/lack-thereof /quirks of the new protocols, security expert [Eileen Wagner](https://radicalnetworks.org/archives/2018/participants/eileen-wagner/) had a great workshop about this at Radical Networks last year :)", "created_at": "2019-05-28 22:45:51.328332", "updated_at": "2019-05-28 22:50:43.833483", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 291, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 60.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53772], "is_reply_to": [53772], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54111, "user_id": 5040, "topic_id": 9953, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:9953\"]\n\u201cnot build the next big thing, but rather build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don\u2019t have to maintain it\u201d.\n[/quote]\n\nhahahahha this had me laughing out loud, I'd missed that he said this! :smile:  He might be onto something considering beaker browsers new development....

It explains a lot... I've been on the edges of the EdgeRyders community twice: once pre-Matera, and now again, but never yet met up with people face-to-face. (Though I am looking forward to attending LOTE6 and meeting people there!)\n\nThinking of the \"fork\" that @Alberto mentioned, before the \"fork\" I felt that EdgeRyders was indeed edgy, occasionally too edgy for comfort. Though I couldn't see where, I felt a background tension. Interesting to learn now that it was partly at least around the unMonastery at Matera. Before @Billy_Smith brought up the issue recently, after the \"fork\" I had a sense that EdgeRyders had now found a more stable mode of existence, and that (interestingly enough) focused around interpersonal relationships and care, with technology and social experiment less up front (though still being a vital ingredient. There is no claim to anything objective here, I'm just reporting my personal impressions.\n\nPeople do tend to look for historical explanations of the present. When things change, there is always the question of why and how they have changed. I do, genuinely and very deeply, support transparency. But I think there needs to be care here as well. Transparency is not just about what happened at a physical level; and it is more than what happened to be written down anywhere. There is a deeply personal aspect to transparency, and I see it as being connected to the narratives we tell ourselves. I believe that we can only achieve collective transparency when those personal narratives are shared and received, and that means firstly that the individuals need to have enough trust to share them (can be difficult), and secondly that others take the time and trouble to listen deeply and reflectively (i.e. reflecting back openly what has been heard) until the person sharing feels truly heard. I understand this as part of the essence of Restorative Circles. If you put in the word \"needs\" then you're pretty close to NVC.\n\nI still wonder if we would collectively do well to hear out the conflict more in a RC manner. I personally would imagine finding it deeply instructive. I'm with @Billy_Smith in the desire to mediate, and I would hope he would be with me in the desire for the matter to be healed more deeply.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-18 08:42:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.195559", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 413, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33462], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28737, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 3775, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>@Noemi @ helen Aspects of the</b>\n\n@noemi @ helen\n\nAspects of the unMonastery are actually proposing some half internal sessions outside the program (at 0900 each morning.)

How to develop this potential?\n\nIndividuals create and shape languages to communicate and share experiences, to produce order and assemble other individuals around a common goal.\u00a0 Individuals of higher status can influence or manipulate others by utilizing language.\u00a0 Awareness of complexity is found at different levels in organizations: through words, arguments, and narrative discourse individuals can create new realities from lower to higher levels in organizations. These organizational levels are defined by the degree of influence and control that some individuals have over others.\n\nIndividuals with higher levels of consciousness are able to deeply observe the world, their relation with other individuals and their interaction among organizations. Observation is the first step before we absorb ourselves into the system. When we are able to identify ourselves as a part of a whole we can contribute to or modify the whole, creating new fictions. As a result, we experience evolution of consciousness. \u00a0\n\nObservation, assimilation, transformation, and evolution are defined here as interactive in all levels of the ascending spiral of the evolution of consciousness.\u00a0 These are the conditions that individuals should attain to create new fictions. This difficult task is impeded by the social standards or the cultural center of gravity that acts like a magnet on individual development. If you are below the average level of consciousness it tends to pull you up. If you try to go above it, it tends to pull you down (Wilber, 2000).\u00a0\n\nOnce individuals attain a higher level of consciousness they feel obligated to add to the whole a representative part of their own existence. The creators of fiction have the duty of creating or contributing to the global meaning, or sense, of the whole system, since organizations are created not only to serve a function, but also to achieve transcendence.\u00a0 A meaningful organization is the result of its individual member\u2019s comprehension. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-05 08:21:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.979830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 369, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11796], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19453, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6229, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>That's a great idea!</b>\n\nWell done, @Shajara !

There is fiat money, which is what everywhere has now, and there is commodity money, based on a product almost people, and will therefore accept. Gold & silver are the common examples of commodity money, but that is because economists do not understand what people actually have traded (I am an economist -- I should know). They are terrible examples. The vast majority of people throughout history never saw a gold coin in their lives -- most never saw silver either. They mostly traded among friends and family as described in the Sociologist Marcel Mauss' 1925 book \"Essai sur le don\" about the Gift economy, which is never mentioned in economics books, but is a foundational text. So with people you know and interact with daily, gifts determine the balance of exchange between you and others. But if you are trading with someone you don't know, you would use barter (my knife and bow for your woman), or domestic animals (chickens, sheep & goats, cows, camels) or grains. Both animals and grains are what should be called \"commodity money\".\n\nSo: alternative currencies. It depends. If, for example, you want to go right back to Paleolithic society, and organize society in groups of the so-called \"Dunbar's number\", which has been proposed as the approximate number of people in early bands of hunter-gatherers, and seems to be the number of people one can know and get along with well, from studies of interactions on Facebook, etc.,then you could use a \"gift economy\" inside the group, organize it as a separate governing entity with every set of about 150 people being self-organizing and more or less anarchistic, but interacting with others on an occasional basis, then maybe a couple of people in the group could act as \"traders\" who use a kind of universal trading currency (call it \"credits\") and a central overarching bank that keeps track (corruption at the bank would be a problem to be solved). So that's one.\n\nAnother might be to use data. You have people who are much better at figuring out how this works than I. Some variant of blockchain technology would keep track of transactions -- this would enable a non-governmentally controlled currency.\n\nJust a caveat: in 21st century US and Japan, and even Europe, the central government's independent central bank has been pretty much all that stood between people and catastrophic economic meltdown. So even though we of course all hate the government and bureaucrats and all, some bureaucrats have saved our skins -- twice in the last 11 years or so. Food for thought.\n\nA third option would be what \"the Machines do, in the Isaac Asimov short story \"The Inevitable Conflict\" -- the last in the book \"I, Robot\" from maybe 1950. In this story there have been positronic brains developed to such a state of perfection that they run the global economy, telling companies what to produce, where to sell it, and on and on, for the optimization of the well-being of humankind. Asimov never actually mentions in this story what currency (if any) is used in the trade of goods and services coordinated by the Machines. But it is entirely possible that because of the unimaginable complexity of the Machines, they could effectively revert to the kind of barter system which economists currently say is impossible -- goods and services for goods & services, but in a very complicated dance which sends diapers here, foodstuffs there, steel elsewhere, and educating the kiddies and the workers... and it is all coordinated so perfectly that Josip receives goods in accordance not only with his need, but also with the amount of productive work he performed at the factory; Aduana the same, along with the dance lessons she craves and works for, Gen the farmer is recompensed similarly not only for the crops they raised but also for the value of the crops that failed due to lack of rain that season, etc., up to the entire global population in exquisitely perfect complexity. <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-12-12 08:57:28.138248", "updated_at": "2020-12-12 08:57:28.138248", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 693, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 41.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 6179], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86522, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14769, "post_number": 14, "raw": "@noemi what address should I share this with? \n\nLaura", "created_at": "2020-11-10 12:12:08.809181", "updated_at": "2020-11-10 12:12:08.809181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86501], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82140, "user_id": 4661, "topic_id": 14264, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I was imagining that for a set of search terms, for each document in the corpus you do a search pair-wise, taking two terms like `wealthcare system` and `low quality`.

This should be fairly easy to adjust, including in the way you suggest of calculating proximity on more of a paragraph basis.  When I was working on Elasticsearch stuff I found it allowed me to insert my own custom tokenizers and analyzers very easily, and I suspect it would be the same for this.  \n\nBut, in any case, once you have proximity values or scores for all the possible pairs, you know which ones are connected, how strong the association is, and the number of occurrences (or number of documents in which the term occurred).  In a force directed graph you could perhaps make the term-node size larger if it had more occurrences, and edge lines thicker for stronger associations.\n\nOne thing I'm puzzled by though is that I would expect you would want to be extracting more meaning regarding how the associated terms are related.  Admittedly, this is a more challenging problem, but I think NLP algorithms are getting better, and the systems can be trained, so....\nAfter all, there is a big difference between:\n\n\"Our `healthcare system` is `low quality` and\n\"So grateful we don't have a `low quality` `healthcare system` like the US!\"\n\nIt may be useful to know in aggregate *what* people are talking about, but what they are saying about it is important too, isn't it?", "created_at": "2020-08-21 00:09:32.349099", "updated_at": "2020-08-21 00:09:32.349099", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82139], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 166, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 133, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Using the Future is an experimental initiative organised by Unesco in collaboration with Edgeryders</h2>\n\n*This project took place in the summer and fall of 2014*\n\nParticipants contribute thought leadership articles to one or more learning goals for Using the Future and meet to discuss the contents over a series of 5 video-conferences lasting 1 hour.

First off, I want to express gratitude to all who have put in so much care/labor to make this convening happen. Due to some bouts with illness amidst relocation to Europe, I am a bit late to the game. Our comrades from Woodbine invited me to contribute ideas a while back and I am just now getting to this as the official program has been decided. I would like to introduce myself still in case this helps facilitate a coming together with those with like concerns, possibly in the freestyle sessions (or even more informally after meals and the like).\n\nAs a curator, citizen, human, I\u2019ve focused my attention primarily on the interrelatedness of groups, subjects, and objects within various social and political systems and, particularly, institutional bodies. Last year I realized that I was at a crucial point where focused time outside of the imperatives and logics of an institution could facilitate a necessary perspectival shift in the work I was doing, one that would inevitably alter the way I\u2019ve been working though the convergence of contingency, labor, administration and planning within organizational bodies in the arts. Just as I slowed down, I got sick. This is how the ongoing curatorial project \u201cSick Time, Sleepy Time, Crip Time: Against Capitalism\u2019s Temporal Bullying\u201d began, out of this lived experience. (Note: \u201cCrip\u201d is a political reclaiming of the derogatory label cripple.)\n\n\u201cSick Time\u201d argues that care for the body in states of debility and disability (particularly their temporalities) can help us to re-imagine the ground necessary for collectivity. It proposes that better incorporation of the temporal states of rest, illness, sleep, and aging into society works against the Eurocentric conception of progressivist linear time that finds its corollary in neoliberal capitalist logics and drains humans of their life blood. Dragging on, circling back, with no regard for the stricture of the work week or compulsory ablebodiness, sick time is non-compliant. It refuses a fantasy of normalcy measured by either-in-or-out thresholds and demands care that exceeds that which the nuclear family unit can provide.  (A set of curatorial notes/manifesto can be found [here](http://temporaryartreview.com/notes-for-sick-time-sleepy-time-crip-time-against-capitalisms-temporal-bullying-in-conversation-with-the-canaries/) and more info about the first exhibition in the series can be found in the PR [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/537c9eb6e4b0ca838c2f4f52/t/58e3bc521e5b6c8ff92d36a1/1491319891111/Sick+Time+PR+Draft_3_30.pdf))\n\nI\u2019d hoped to offer a bodily communication workshop centered around how we communicate about illness, but perhaps some of the artist\u2019s practices/experiments in this show might be interesting to discuss. Much of the work being done by the artists and communities of care in \u201cSick Time\u201d relates to a distinction articulated by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten in their 2013 book between policy vs planning. In short, policy comes from above and pronounces others as incorrect, while planning invents the means [of social reproduction] in a common experiment. \u201cPlanning in the undercommons is not an activity, not fishing or dancing or teaching or loving, but the ceaseless experiment with the futurial presence of the forms of life that make such activities possible. Planning is rooted in a black radicalism, which hopes against hope...in order to survive in the deplorable present\" As Harney and Moten further detail, \u201cManagement looses not in workplace but economic management can not win in realm of social reproduction...here, management encounters forms of what we will call planning. In the undercommons of the social reproductive realm the means, which is to say the planners, are still part of the plan.\"\n\nOne example to look at might be the Canaries. Canaries is a support group and art collective for people with autoimmune diseases that operate on crip time amidst a scarcity of language to address rapidly unfolding chronic illnesses. For the publication project, _Notes for the Waiting Room_ they contributed texts and images addressing the question: \u201cHow do you take care of yourself during a flare-up of your symptoms?\u201d The resulting publication, distributed in art contexts as well as in doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, challenges the unilateral and hierarchical transmission of information from doctor to patient and, much like the overall art and advocacy work of Canaries, fosters solidarity and embodied knowledge sharing instead. Or another example is the work Cassie Thornton has done. She has investigated the impact of economic systems on public affect and behavior for some time and, like Canaries, is currently exploring methods of social healthcare by testing a model for de-financialized care that responds to the experience of crisis. \n\nBy constituting new cultural rituals and creating provisional non-hierarchical infrastructures, these artist\u2019s works question the very borders of a body and provide myriad radical possibilities for gaining agency and negotiation with the problems of the body by using a political relational model that views dependency with others positively. While the space of the arts has long been a site for new modes of self representation, critique, cross-disciplinary experimentation, the envisioning of alternatives, and challenging the dominance of mind-centered epistemologies that dislodge us from our bodies, it could be interesting to discuss how it allows for a reconfiguration of structures of care that then does or does not trickle out. Of course there is a certain experimentation of forms that is germane to the arts, but there is also the way arts critiques just helps institutions optimize under neoliberalism etc to consider\u2026\n\nLooking forward to discussing this and more!", "created_at": "2017-10-02 16:13:53.629886", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 13:15:54.228828", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 933, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 177.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37339, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7252, "post_number": 1, "raw": "These are by @winnieponcelet :slight_smile:\n[quote=\"winnieponcelet, post:8, topic:7237\"]\nBioFabbing convergence in Ideasquare at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.

We collect knowledge and practices that people in different sectors are using to keep their businesses afloat right now. An open discussion can provide valuable advices, experiences and opportunities for further learning and collaboration.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/433619044\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWhat does it mean to be safe if we look from the perspective of resilient livelihoods?\n\nWe used to do economic development policy by adopting a unique idea of what a good society looks like and everyone is supposed to conform to that. Since we are now losing faith in this model, we should encourage peripheral regions to experiment different economic systems.\n\n**In the case of Messina,** this seems to have come about by pioneering an approach resting on four elements:\n\n* **relational goods** (encoding human relationship in physical goods. Example: the local brewery had been bought up by Heineken, who proceeded to delocalize production. The Messina crowd allied with laid off brewery workers to start a new brewery. The beer made there encodes human values of dignity, local regeneration and hope).\n* **Stocks over flows** (social economy tends to be undercapitalized, because its protagonists focus on getting funding for short-term projects. The community foundation funds no projects, only permanent initiatives)\n* **Systems over networks** (the difference is this: the components of a system are happy to reassess their strategy depending on that of the others, moving in a more coordinated way)\n* **Dyson\u2019s sphere model** (the Dyson sphere is an imaginary artefact built all around a star to capture its energy. The idea is to create prosperity for every member of the system: when a client comes around wanting, say, a consultant to organize a workshop, they are immediately asked if they also need a venue, a translation service, a travel agency and so on\u2026 all parts of the system).\n\nOver the years and in part based on the culture of the founders, they were able to come up with practices that are self-evident to them, but counter-intuitive to us.\n\nOne example: they have **assembled an art collection without buying any of the pieces** .\n\nThey acquired them all through donations or artist residencies. The collection is worth several millions now, and Guggenheim has tried to acquire it, but of course the foundation can never sell it without destroying the goodwill that made it possible to acquire it in the first place.\n\n**That the collection cannot be sold does not mean it is worthless** .\n\nIt has **value in two senses** : as the *embodiment of the relationship* of mutual trust between the Foundation and artists, and as *a collateral to roll out revenue-generating projects* . The collection is valued not for its resale value, but for its **potential to grow and catalyse more activities** . You do not realize this value by cashing out on the asset, but by stewarding and growing it. This is a very different value theory from the one dominant in capitalism and neoclassical economics. It is an example of the kind of thinking that can emerge from mutual aid communities.\n\nWhile seemingly simple and fairly easy to adopt these principles in other places, it is also easy to underestimate the complexity of local differences and embeddedness, as well as of local and regional inequalities.\n\nOne of the views that emerged in our discussion was:\n\n\"From my experience of working in the UK, I am not sure if the definition of well being and safety is shared across different communities. For many safety and security is keeping people outside of the borders and this view often belogns to the Brexit voters. There is a big risk that people are left behind in transformations, because we are not listening to communities and creating strong cultural bonds. The situation is complex, there is not the same clarity for everyone.\u201c\n\nSo how can we implement the lessons learned?\n\nWhat does it mean for those who wish to support economic regeneration in the wake of #covid19 or The Green New Deal?\n\n\u201cI am wondering whether we could create access through the mutual support groups of sharing and caring communities? How do you expand on the Messina case? How to add on top of that trans-contextual literacy in these already stand alone communities - through more flexible policy making (not waiting for the EU)? Climb the ladder bottom up and expand on it. The axes of sharing and caring communities could be the way to start. What would be the motto to use to find that intersection?\u201d\n\n**Nora Bateson** says that when the systems are stuck they don\u2019t get unstuck if someone says it, but only if the systems learn together. Experience of creating trans-contextuality - experiences with different identities, empathy, get the glimpse of the context of others, go beyond the polarisations and the idea of the democratic process. Lack of trust in society - part of the core things not working. Automatization of who we are. The idea of subsidiarity - top down, not bottom up and it is completely missing as well the dynamic ways of doing policies. We need a dynamic way of testing and designing policies and interventions. Locally driven and context dependent. Forget about the scalability.\n\nA key aspect is that we are going to need to **experiment new processes and models** for working with movement building to get something to happen, and then **protect its integrity for long enough that the desired results become visible** . A process which embeds the means to strengthen the political/ideological movements that have supported and protected it.\n\nAn interesting example of what happens when you don\u2019t manage to do this is the *Finnish Basic Income experiment* . A well thought through proposal originally came from progressive activism and was co-opted by the political platform of the liberals. They ignored fundamental elements and executed it badly. Some of these fundamental elements were giving basic income to a randomly selected sample of at least 30,000 individuals. Neither condition was met. Also, it ran for less than half of the time estimated for the experiment to succeed in meeting its main target. The result was that it did not bring significant employment effects (Demos Helsinki has published the [full report here](https://www.demoshelsinki.fi/en/2020/05/08/letter-results-of-finlands-basic-income-experiment-will-help-us-build-the-post-pandemic-society)).\n\nCompare this to the **history of Folkh\u00f6gskola** (Folk high schools), a Nordic model for adult education and lifelong learning that has been around since 1844. The concept originally came from the Danish writer, poet, philosopher, and pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig. The folk high school movement was an act against a [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative) ideal of both education and culture. At its core was an idea was to give the peasantry and other people from the lower echelons of society a higher educational level through personal inner development. It was born out of a reaction against the Enlightenment\u2019s view of our mind as a fixed, rational machine as opposed to being embodied in the totality of our bodies and embedded in our culture. After the 1848 revolutions in Germany these ideas travelled to the Nordic countries where they were then adopted in the educational model pioneered by Grundtvig and contemporaries. Tomasz Maliszewski at the Polish Naval Academy gives a detailed account of the rich history of this institution in Sweden:\n\n[T_Maliszewski-OntheHistoryofFolkHighSchoolsinSweden.pdf](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/short-url/jgK9bC291Ap2XAZgqSVvmXxP1k7.pdf)\n\n*One conclusion we draw is that we need to embed the idea of Citizen Engagement as community action on experimenting local development economic models, rather than as citizen-to-institution consultation.*\n\nBecause the citizen-engagement-as-consultation mindset does not look at the issue of power. Consulting citizens is one of those ideas that sound like a no-brainer, but are very difficult to get the incentives aligned right for. It\u2019s like experiments: the idea of policy experiments sounds great, but try proposing in a European forum \u201clet\u2019s have an experiment: revoke the copyright directive for Latvia\u201d. You won\u2019t get far, because the powerful people already have what they want. You can experiment only if you can override them, but if you could do that you could also attempt to establish an alternative policy anyway. With consultation it is the same. If the results of the consultation go against what powerful stakeholders want, the temptation to tell citizens \u201cwe have heard you, but we do not think we can go by what you recommend\u201d is going to be too strong.\n\nThere could be a way out from this situation: invest time in the regional level because maybe you can allow citizens to hold real power, or experiment, if you go to a place that \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d. At the periphery of Europe\u2019s economy, it is easier to get away with things. And indeed, **Europe is swarming with mutant local economies** (like [this case](https://edgeryders.eu/t/13876) in Catalonia).\n\nIn practice we need to find new arenas where we can broker specific deals between communities and their local institutional and political actors around getting specific things off the ground. And create conditions for them to have staying power.\n\nThe SciFi Economics Lab explores how to spark and nurture similar dynamics between regional administrations, political activists and groups running existing initiatives which embody different economic models. We explore how can we give enablers of a transition to a thriving future access to political power so they create the change needed?

I'd really like to hear more and find out how an OpenVillage house can fit into the local conditions in Jordan. So interesting!\n\nHere is one remarks already: integrating a hotel, as you intend to, can be a good business model. But in touristic places, the traditional hotel business model is probably too tough in terms of competition. There are always people who are not well served by existing offers of accommodation \u2013 often these are young people, so serving their needs fits right into the purpose of OpenVillage houses. \n\nFor example in Nepal, @anu is looking to found an OpenVillage house that provides good, low-cost accommodation to students coming from rural areas to the capital Kathmandu. They can pay some money, but not much, so currently they often live in bad houses. But with new ideas of how to use the rooms in an OpenVillage house better, they should be able to get good living conditions (for ideas see [here](/t/id/6892/16), at point \"agile bedroom management\").\n\nIn Jordan right now, what are the groups of people with the biggest need for better living conditions?\n\nAlso have a look at the article \"[Proposal for a network of OpenVillage houses](http:///t/id/6785)\", if you haven't seen it yet.

That was a mistake because so much has changed in the 60ish years since Mahatmaji died that a lot of it just doesn't make sense, and he died before much of the theory was tested, which means we don't have his experience and learning about his own philosophies to learn from. His models constantly evolved, and we have no idea what he would have added, subtracted or changed about his theories given more time!\n\nSo I've had to go back and apply the method: first speak the truth, then live it. I'm not doing very well at living the truth - still tied to market capitalism, and hedging my bets with the military-industrial complex. I have not achieved ahimsa - I've got an intellectual understanding of non-violence, and the soul of a killer. I'm still working towards it, but it seems further away than ever: rage gets fast, easy, destructive results.\n\nBut that's the key: I am where I am, and I tell the truth about what I know. The method is what counts from Gandhiji, not his results from the method.\n\nWe have very little hope of implementing his conclusions, but there is absolute freedom to implement his methods and reach our own conclusions. It'll likely destroy everything we believe and most of our cherished assumptions along the way, but isn't that the point: it cost Gandhi his racism, his caste privilege, his gender privilege and everything else as he went along coming to the conclusion that so much of his own native culture was abuse and lies, and polished layer after layer clear, abandoning each unsupportable prejudice within himself and within the world as he went.\n\nSuch are our demigods of the past.\n\nSuch may we become!\n\nThe only card I have left is to acknowledge that I am out of cards.\n\nI really was listening to that old devil Bembo Davis.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-16 15:47:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.665849", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 376, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17961, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1957, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>It's not too late for funding people's travels either</b>\n\n[Nadia] is doing a lot of work\u00a0behind the scenes and traveling to events, talking to people and organisations.\u00a0Who knows, maybe something will come up in the end :-)\u00a0and in that scenario of course those Edgeryders having helped the most are first in line to benefit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-17 16:48:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:40.305483", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 67, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16507], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20719, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 5259, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Move your chair</b>\n\nI think it will be too messy especially if people will start to do it by the stairs (they are too tight).

As a crowd based solution different people are encouraged to join in at different times; thus the challenge is to embrace chaos and define what direction the project can take. It's a cloud of concept of occasional contributions aiming towards development of a platform for bringing emerging rehabilitation technology or ideas into practical use. \n\n**01_Why are we here**\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4818b9f2c7b03d691184bb32238378f00c55ddc2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\nTo get a better understanding about what brings us together in this project, we sat down and wrote posters mentioning the main objectives of the project that were divided later into groups. The result was four groups as seen on the foto above. Chiara was helping us by synthesizing some headlines written in black. \n\n_Crescita personale - Personal growth_\nThe aim is to learn how to manage a distributed community, dividing the objectives and tasks for each person involved. The main outcome is to create a platform thanks to which people will find, create and share personalized assistive devices. Consequent but fundamental outcome of the project is the creation of growing awareness among the society regarding modern accessible technology that brings people freedom to create customised assistive/rehabilitative solutions without initial specific knowledge and preparation, becoming more independent physically.\nAs this project has a novel approach and objective with no known preceding experiences to draw from it is also an opportunity for personal development of the involved people. \n\n_Messa a sistema - Documentation_\nBeing research relying heavily on academic resources, we are interested in understanding how this research can be of scientific value. An objective is to write a scientific article in synergy with the open-source/sharing philosophy of the project. The subject matter of such publication will be to demonstrate and prove the viability of the approach, answering the question: can the creativity of people with physical limitations be leveraged to help them solving their  personal needs?\n\n_Collaborazione & Comunit\u00e0 - Collaboration & Community_\nWeHandU activists need to understand and learn how to manage the community. Co-working, open-source and collaborative design and production without top-down control requires understanding of the social mechanisms that motivates people to contribute actively. How can we reach a critical mass to consolidate continuous collaboration network (People with needs \u2013> makerspace <\u2013 Research and Healthcare providers)?. \n\n_Progettuale - Project content_\nAs part of collaboration and management the WeHandU.it is a site under construction. It could become a hub serving different functions; informations about solutions and possibilities, a place where people can meet, discuss and share ideas and offer the possibility to share content and join discussions forums.\n\n_Capire le potenzialit\u00e0 - Assessing feasibility of the idea_\nThe endpoint of the project should be to draw conclusions and directions for further development of the feasibility of the proposed approach.\n\n\n**02_Brainstorming**\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfdb1cb79128928cbd0cf1ebd7444dc457b9de65.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"558\">\n\nThen we had a brainstorm session. Here,  anything that comes into your mind is possible and serves to analyze the common factors. We came up with 10 discussion points:\nTechnology abandonment (literature tells us that a large proportion of existing assistive devices are abandoned. Mostly because they don\u2019t meet the user's expectations and needs)  \nCo-Working/Design (involvement of all stakeholders in the realization)\nThe valley of death - known to be the problem of letting a conceptual idea become available to the user. Many ideas \u2018die\u2019 while trying to become a commercial product.\nKnowledge exchange - on one hand we have knowledge of what can be done to help people, on the other hand we have people who have knowledge of what help they need. \nEmpowerment is a recent \u2018buzzword\u2019 in rehabilitation, meaning people taking responsibility for their care. \nSIVA.IT is an example of an empowering service (evaluation and consultation on choice of assistive technology. A leader among seven major national portals throughout Europe. )\n\u201cI\u2019m disabled, help me\u201d the classical paradigm of care. This leads to next point:\n\u201cHelp me find a solution\u201d which is the foundation of the WeHandU paradigm to explore. \n\u201cResponsibility of the patient\u201d \u2026 to become a creator of solutions.\n\u201cResearch evidence\u201d  shows that increasingly more chronic patients are inventing solutions for alleviating their problems on their own.\n\nOur hypothesis is that, there are resources out there that hasn\u2019t been used yet, creativity(or critical opinion/evaluation) of the user, of those who look for a personalised solution(assistive technology). New technologies like 3d printing enables us to create  personalised solutions. \n\n**03_Create an elevator pitch**\n\nSo how do we explain all this in a few words? \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/03ae6d308ae5541c11a30053d1180d55ce94119c.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"481\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aec1646524cd30468ecce3b4f5d9d025eae79866.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"357\">\n\nThe project WeHandU is an open system/service/experiment that assists in generating ideas, project-design-make and share the solution for/with people (having/not having special needs to help coping with physical limitation/disability) that seeks to produce useful devices that facilitates physical activities of daily living in contrast to the classical healthcare model.\n\n\n**04_Meet your neighbours**\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9713a8c16c58b41a6d3c028f23e6ce9a384bd75b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"382\">\n\nWeMake: The OpenCare can be thought of as a container class containing a variety of projects of which WeHandU is a specifically focused embodiment\n\nReHub: Is working on a rehabilitation glove. Can we collaborate on in clinical trials\nResQ:\tIs working with software. Could it develop as a recruitment/collaboration app.\n\nAnd fortunately Silvia gave us a hand here on the graphical side:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/73ac71e08612fb7dfce5ba79753abcc820f861ce.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"483\">\n\nIt connects all the arguments that we touched during the Agile planning phase.\nConclusions\nWeHandU is a prototype framework: Overall objective is to test if people who are motivated to solve their personal needs, can be empowered to create an assistive device for themselves. We will support them in the process using this rapid prototyping technology.  \nSo we can summarize this to the following structure with a trinity of roles:\n\n**Participants**: Promoters of awareness of the needs. They are protagonist of a path to autonomy conducted by \"carriers of interest\" \n**Mentors**: Expert participants helping to understand the possibilities. Linking new with existing solutions and making the whole process sustainable and scalable.\n**Facilitators**: Assisting with preparation, analysis, study and realization of individual solutions. Keeping scientific approach to problem solving, promoting reproducibility. \n\nA long learning process on Agile planning in a chaotic crowd is ahead before the action can start. Action must start to create content. We need to select and implement adequate technology and tools, workflows, meeting cultures and know our collaborators.  Since the project aims to create a platform with an active and independent community, it is important to find the tools to manage an open source coworking/codesign project, and to learn how to reach the critical mass to consolidate the collaboration with WeMake. Meeting may happen both in person and through video-call, thus keeping contact with everyone, even if mobility issues keeps them distant from the operative core.\n\nThe work that has been done at WeMake, had showed us more in detail the importance of the team work and precisely planned tasks and gave as more tools to organise the work - e.g. Github\nThis project is very ambitious, that\u2019s why it is crucial to create step by step phases that will proof project efficiency on the early stages and/or discover more objectives that are vital for the success\nWe found that team is aligned on the main objectives\nWe have realized the importance of interaction with more organisation (e.g.makerspaces, other healthcare initiatives) that will help us to build and test our service\nNext steps\n1.\tTo complete a concrete prototyping project for the WeHandU framework.\n*\tIdentify a person who becomes a Participant in the WeHandU\u2026\n*\t...Who has a concrete solvable problem and is motivated. \n*\tLetting the Facilitators device and propose a initial solution which the Participant  can realize.\n*\tThrough engagement in the affine processes encourage the Participant to become Mentor for future events\n\n2.\tHarvest data from this prototyping experience \n*\tfor publication\n*\tconsolidating/developing/correcting workflow\n*\tlist and publish lessons learned\n\nDisclaimer: The purpose of this article is to stimulate discussion.

It's also not actually the case that that QE is expanding our money supply (people with bank deposits), it's actually expanding the bank's money supply, essentially the amount of money in the clearing system, and although there is a link between the two, increasing the bank's money doesn't necessarily increase the general money supply.\n\nOn the other hand the monetary statistics are very clear that the money supplies of Spain, Greece, and the UK are currently contracting. This is a major problem, because it causes monetary deflation (prices drop for purely mechanical reasons, not because more is being produced which is the good kind of deflation). Monetary deflation is an issue because prices of most things can adjust to the money supply over time, but one thing critically can't - and that's debt.\u00a0\n\nBesides the not inconsiderable technical issues with Bitcoin, the real issue isn't the monetary unit in and of itself. It's the debt networks that are created from it. I do get very nervous when people start throwing around all these alternative curency ideas, because the potential for them to go badly wrong is very high - 19th century American Banking is a fun study for that kind of thing.\n\nA fascinating paper that i think everybody should read is the semi-notorious \"Cigarette Paper\" by R.

Most recently I am working on a government programme that will see over 300 small community based locations for the public to get access to the internet. Many of these will seek to develop co-working spaces for their local communities to avoid having to commute. I\u2019m helping with up to 12 locations in my municipality. I have also been asked to help look at other community hub developments that do not have the same government backing, but will experience many of the same problems with generating demand, usage as well as the challenges facing the volunteers managing these facilities. My job is to help them to be successful.\n* How has the Covid19 crisis impacted your work processes?\nThere has been a step increase in demand/interest in remote working and coworking that can facilitate the balance between working outside the main business premises but can provide the social interaction that humans require.\n* Where do you see the potential for technologies to improve co-working?\ntechnology is critical- from the tools to enable coworking to take place with people working for a variety of employers or for themselves through to the security, booking, location management of people using the co working spaces. For COVID19 control we need to be able to have accurate records of who is using co-working spaces to enable tracking and tracing of the virus to be carried out.\n* What do you think will/have to be the key changes/future developments in the co-working sector in future?\nThere will be increased interest however individual experiences will determine how successful it is both for the individual and for employers. Security for example is still an area that will require further work- challenges such as Data Security, security of the premises and property within it, personal security for those using such facilities (Cyber and personal).

Introduction](#heading--1)**\n\n**[2. Instructions](#heading--2)**\n\n**[3. Example](#heading--3)**\n\n----\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Introduction</h2>\n\nThis topic shows how a Google Slides presentation can be integrated into a Discourse post. It uses one image per slide for the preview, and a link to the full presentation.\n\nThe process will be simpler and better once we have implemented [#102 \"Allow embedding Google Slide presentations\"](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/102).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Instructions</h2>\n\n1. **Convert your presentation to a series of images.** When your presentation is made with Google Slides, you have two options:\n\n    * \"File \u2192 Download as \u2026 \u2192 JPEG image (.jpg, current slide)\". Obviously this can take some time as you have to download an image for each slide separately.\n    * \"File \u2192 Download as \u2026 PDF Document (.pdf)\", and afterwards convert the PDF to a series of images with ImageMagick: `convert -density 160 slides.pdf slides.jpg`.\n\n2. **Get the code.** Edit this wiki, copy the post below from section \"2. Example\" and paste it into your own post.\n\n3. **Replace the images** in the code with those of your own presentation.\n\n4. **Replace the link** to the full presentation with one belonging to your own one. You get this link in the Google Slides web application as follows:\n\n    1. Open the presentation file in Google Slides, in our example with [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DWb4ZTLT8aXt5WVyG__GglFgcfhkmu7etfQn2wGSgiw/edit).\n    2. Go to \"File \u2192 Publish to the web \u2026 \u2192 Link\" and click \"Publish\".\n    3. Copy the URL from the box that will appear.\n\n5. **Save** to publish your post.\n\n_[TODO: Change the ImageMagick command so that it will also create a black border around all slides. Otherwise, as in the example below, slides with white background will not look well.]_\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Example</h2>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<i>(Click the image to view the presentation.

If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself and the data you have provided from the study at any time during the event, without giving a reason and without penalty, by advising the researchers of this decision. If after the interview you choose to withdraw, please contact Maria Kling (maria.euler@edgeryders.eu)\n3. **What will happen if I take part in the research?** The event takes place digitally via Zoom. It consists of an open discussion, moderated by Edgeryders staff.  If you take part in the event you will be able to listen and contribute to the discussion. Edgeryders staff will take notes, and reflect of the main issues raised during the call. \n4. **Are there any potential risks in taking part?** The risks of participation are minimal and include for example involuntary data breach leading to sharing beyond the original intention. We are committed to prevent any of this. We are using a third party service as a facility for video conferencing. So, we are subject to the quirks, features and security issues that come with that software. In particular, be aware that they may record your IP, even if you connect with a pseudonym via a browser.\n5. **Are there any benefits in taking part?** There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study. The study may contribute to understanding the broader effects of *How to recover and develop the co-working sector following the COVID crisis*. As a result, it may have an indirect benefit to participants. You will also get great opportunities to connect to and network with people from this sector/interested in this topic. There will be no payment for taking part in this study.\n6. **How is the event documented?** We do record the call. We take notes and will publish one or more writeups. For this, we will adhere to Chatham House rules: we mention what people said, but not who said what in case of participants. The chat will be saved temporarily, for the purposes of completing the writeups, but not shared, and deleted as the writeups are published.\n 7. **Will the research be published?** One or more writeups will appear on https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364. Writeups will be attributed to their authors, not the participants. That is an open forum, so participants are welcome to use it to comment, respond, or contribute their own writeups. The whole content of the public-facing forum(including the mentioned writeup, and any discussion about them) will then become the basis for at least one research report. We also hope to publish one or more journal article. If you would like to be a co-author, we are in principle open for it. Please contact *Maria Kling* (contact info below).\n8. **Who is organising and funding the research?** The research is organised by Edgeryders and funded by the European Union via a research project called [NGI Forward ](https://research.ngi.eu/).\n9. **Who do I contact if I have a concern about the study or I wish to complain?** You can contact *Maria Kling* Community Manager at Edgeryders via emailing them at *maria.euler@edgeryders.eu*.", "created_at": "2020-10-13 13:37:05.650489", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 16:04:27.658921", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 591, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84876, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Yes it was, @MariaEuler it would be good to send the people on that list an invitation to this event - no?", "created_at": "2020-10-13 13:33:37.811646", "updated_at": "2020-10-13 13:33:37.811646", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84873], "is_liked_by": [6658], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80668, "user_id": 6550, "topic_id": 14066, "post_number": 26, "raw": "Hi Nacho,\n\nVery interesting post and gives a great insight into your thinking behind what you are doing.

Sometimes, to be sure, it is our own fault: unfocused or unrealistic ideas, or sound ideas that we, alone, lack the capacity to deliver.

This conjecture is based on the observation of the interaction between the community and the Council of Europe during the first Edgeryders iteration in 2012. Being innovative requires creativity, radicality and out-of-the-box thinking, but that\u2019s scary and strange to large orgs.

We debated citizen engagement in a refreshingly hype-free way \u2013 no one even mentioned any magic app or technology, it must be a first in the 21st century. I took home a number of points from my fellow panelists, that I detailed <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/t/participants-questions-and-observations-from-the-euregionsweek-workshop/14499?u=alberto\">elsewhere</a>. This post presents in written form my own opening remarks, and the question I asked the panel.\n\nCitizens' participation to the definition, implementation, and monitoring of public policies is perhaps my central interest. I have a background in regional development, and that led me to look into citizen engagement with a lot of attention. If you have done any regdev at all, you will know how important it is for the local people to support what you are doing. Getting anything done in the presence of substantial opposition is impossible, of course: but many projects lose steam and ultimately fail just because there is not enough positive will to make them happen. In my country of origin, Italy, there is a <a href=\"https://www.francoangeli.it/ricerca/Scheda_libro.aspx?ID=6130\">landmark study by Luigi Bobbio</a>, who followed 100 local development initiatives over five years; by the end of the study, only 5 had been completed, with all the others being mired in procedural complexity, NIMBY fights, polemics.\n\nSo, in the early 2000s, I started to think we could use the Internet, that at the time was becoming a mass commodity, to engage citizens on our work. Over the following years, I built up substantial experience, mostly while working for the Italian ministry of economic development. In 2010 I felt that experience was mature enough to become <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia/\">a book on \"government by wiki\" and collective intelligence</a>.\n\nIn the 2010s, I left government and became more of a researcher, but I kept following this idea, within the context of my current home, <a href=\"https://start.edgeryders.eu\">Edgeryders</a>. Over the years, we have become quite good at engaging citizens on large online dialogues, which we think of as networks of social interaction carrying content, and performing sophisticated analysis on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xH54IQ5blMQ\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, but it can be done. And when people ask us \u201cHow do you get people to engage?\u201d There are always two answers. The first: have a fair social contract underpinning the participation. Someone asks you \u201cwhat do I get for the time I put into participating?\u201d, you need to have an answer. The second: ask interesting, relevant, mobilizing questions. And this brings me back to regional policies.\n\nThe principle driving regional policies in Europe is called <strong>convergence</strong>. It is inspired by maps like this one \u2013 you have seen it a million times in one version or another. The idea is that what is different should be made the same. Moreover, there is a clear ranking: Thessaly should become like Bavaria, not vice versa.\n\n![r78dg-eu-regions-by-per-capita-gdp-2018|689x613](upload://hGsZKVKufhBR1XVtdBZIb0eJemr.png) \n\nConvergence is there for a reason: it reduces the scope for competition between low- and high-labor costs regions, and this way makes transitioning to the Single Market less traumatic. However, I think it is not a mobilizing issue for citizens. For two reasons.\n\nThe first one: <strong>the model underpinning convergence needs to be changed anyway</strong>. If we take seriously a transition to low carbon, the idea that more growth is better needs an overhaul. At a minimum we need to refine our definition of <em>what</em> should be growing.\n\nAnd this brings me to the second reason: <strong>Europe is a mosaic of cultures, traditions, lifestyles, and people do not like theirs to be considered inferior to another along some arbitrary scale</strong>. It\u2019s a bit like looking at a cat and saying it\u2019s a lousy dog: it is not false, but it kind of misses the point of that a cat is, and what it brings to the table. And indeed, convergence does not work very well. Many peripheral regions have been struggling for decades, only to find themselves the eternal laggards. This breeds not engagement, but cynicism and resentment towards the European project.\n\nOn top of that, despite very substantial effort being invested into it, <strong>it is not clear that the model is working that well</strong>. The EU and its member states <a href=\"https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/overview#\">invest roughly 100 billion EUR per year on cohesion policies</a>. Despite this, the Commission's own analysts report that <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/work/200801_convergence.pdf\">convergence slowed down or stalled after 1995</a>. I have my own thoughts about how and why this happens, but let's leave them for another day.\n\nSo, what if we used citizen engagement to ask a very different question?\n\nWhat if we asked European regions, especially at the periphery, <strong>not to try to \u201ccatch up\u201d with Bavaria, but rather to <em>lead</em> in experimenting with different economic systems?</strong> Maybe Thessaly does not want to be like Bavaria after all. Maybe it wants to be like Bhutan, promote harmony and \u201cgross national happiness\u201d. Maybe Pomerania wants to try a high-efficiency, low-GDP economy based on public goods. Maybe Sicily wants to try being a solarpunk utopia of mostly self-sustaining communities. As these regions move up the learning curve, their learning benefits us all \u2013 we can copy from them, the former laggards, what they have found to work. They would also, presumably, learn from each other, and those running on the same economic operating systems would form inter-regional alliances. The map of EU regions would no longer be shades of one color, but rather a mosaic of different colors, like this:\n\n![7Vs6C-eu-2050-by-economic-paradigm|690x604](upload://6CAs53ttNbrU3I1BhuHuqcrdOIH.png) \n\nIf you are a science fiction reader, this will look familiar. It's how I imagine a map of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age#Phyles\">Phyles</a> in Neal Stephenson's <em>The Diamond Age</em>, or of  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Ignota#Setting\">Hives</a> in Ada Palmer's <em>Terra Ignota</em> novel, or again of Centenals in Malka Older's eponymous <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/series/thecentenalcycle\">cycle</a>. This is no coincidence: these authors all explore the real-world idea that nation states are no longer fit for purpose. The EU itself has no small part in making this idea attractive to speculative minds.\n\n<strong>It might sound radical, but remember it\u2019s how China did it</strong>. In 1980, president Deng drew a curve on the map around Shenzen and said \u201cLet\u2019s make a capitalist economy, but only in this special economic zone\u201d. When that proved to work, arrangements in Shenzen were debugged and scaled to the country, with the results you are seeing today.\n\n<strong>My hunch is that a radical, honest approach to regional policies would lead to much more, and better, citizen engagement, ultimately boosting the moonshot of the green transition</strong>. And we need that boost, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VUgUfSyQh00\">time is running out</a>. If you, like me, are up for exploring this notion, get in touch (leave a comment here, or write to ivan@edgeryders.eu).

Why? Well because a lot of the time what the people working on to solve one issue, can have positive effects on other issues. Take community gardening as an example from a different domain. The protagonist of such a project may be doing it for one reason (greening the city), but someone else looking at another issue might pick up on the fact that it is getting elderly people in the neighbourhood to exercise more, meet others etc. And connect it as a public health solution. For the protagonists this could mean they get more support from unexpected sources.\n\n### Proposals already developed by the NGI Forward project\n*  [Vision-for-the-future-internet-long-version-final-1.pdf|attachment](upload://7o9Gz3BT3BDMtTQp4yCpyidki2g.pdf) (1.5 MB)  \n\n\n# Possible Frameworks for structuring the content/discussion?\n\nWhy do this? Because in a discussion about any complex topic, our underlying perspective shapes where we decide to direct our gaze, and how we understand what we think we see.

Get Copywriter to produce short texts that weave together the different pieces of content that we have clustered under the different headers.\n\n5. Stick it all into a book (give it to a graphic designer to do the layout and add some illustrations.\n\n\n### We have been asked to include content that explores the following themes:\n\n* **digital labour:** \u201cdigital labour\u201d is not a code currently, but we have a lot around  `work`  and interesting discussions about  `imagining the future`  and  `imagining alternatives`  around that. We also have codes specifically about  `content moderation`  and  `compensating moderators`\n\n\n* **health:** `health`  is a core code with several related codes like  `healthcare`  ,  `mental health`  and  `public health`\n\n\n* **alternatives to surveillance capitalism and sharing economy:** We have a lot going on around \u201calternatives to surveillance capitalism and sharing economy\u201d. See our [NGI Code Review Wiki](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-code-review-wiki-legacy/14458/18) for a nice detailed overview, e.g: t\u2019s clear even at this level that the use of  `personal data`  sets up a  `trade-off`  for a lot of participants. In  `decision-making`  about sharing or protecting  `personal data`  , community members are  `considering larger context`  around its use and  `assessing the impact`  of the trade-off.  `cost`  is also a key consideration.  `Personal data`  also connects strongly, if we move south, to  `agency`  , in a highly illustrative cluster with  `control`  and  `user experience`  . We see, again, trade-offs set up \u2013 between  `user control`  and  `user experience`  , raising questions about what one gets when one gives up  `personal data`  , and how much control is possible. Community members also raise questions about the effort and  `cost`  of controlling personal data in the current environment, when responsibility is highly individualised (  `individualising responsibility`  is a salient code at a lower level of co-occurrences). ALSO `open source`  also strongly connects with  `privacy`  , an extremely central node in the conversation.  `privacy`  connects back to  `personal data`  , and we see an illustrative network of privacy concerns articulated by the community: around  `smart cities`  and  `human rights`  ,  `covid-19`  and  `contact tracing`  , and as aforementioned,  `trade-off`  and  `decision-making`  . A salient theme is the question of how to weigh up privacy trade-offs, in order to make optimal decisions about one\u2019s own data privacy. What does it  `cost`  ? There is  `uncertainty`  around how extensive  `surveillance`  is, and a  `distrust`  of the information that one is given about these technologies, which makes making quality decisions about these issues difficult for community members. We also talk about these themes in [our preliminary findings](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-ethnography-preliminary-findings-october-2020/14542): Some operators are turning to  `technological solutions`  like  `apps`  to monitor their facilities and regulate members\u2019  `access control`  . This raises some questions about  `privacy`  but operators seem to find access control apps to be the most practical option for the moment.\n\n\n* **citizen science:** While we don\u2019t have the specific code \u201ccitizen science\u201d we do have a similar code,  `open science`  which is all about making science and scientific findings accessible. alongside that he have the code  `conducting scientific research`  which is about the process of acquiring and disseminating scientific data.\n\n* **collective data rights:** Collective data rights is not a code on its own, but we do have several codes that describe aspects of this/ co-occur to represent this idea, such as  `data rights`  ,  `collective intelligence`  ,  `data protection`  ,  `commons`  , which is defined as \u201cand or resources belonging to or affecting the whole of a community, in this case referring to the Internet\u201d.

If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself and the data you have provided from the study at any time during the event, without giving a reason and without penalty, by advising the researchers of this decision. If after the interview you choose to withdraw, please contact Maria Kling (maria.euler@edgeryders.eu)\n3. **What will happen if I take part in the research?** The event takes place digitally via Zoom. It consists of an open discussion, moderated by Edgeryders staff.  If you take part in the event you will be able to listen and contribute to the discussion. Edgeryders staff will take notes, and reflect of the main issues raised during the call. \n4. **Are there any potential risks in taking part?** The risks of participation are minimal and include for example involuntary data breach leading to sharing beyond the original intention. We are committed to prevent any of this. We are using a third party service as a facility for video conferencing. So, we are subject to the quirks, features and security issues that come with that software. In particular, be aware that they may record your IP, even if you connect with a pseudonym via a browser.\n5. **Are there any benefits in taking part?** There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study. The study may contribute to understanding the broader effects of *How to recover and develop the co-working sector following the COVID crisis*. As a result, it may have an indirect benefit to participants. You will also get great opportunities to connect to and network with people from this sector/interested in this topic. There will be no payment for taking part in this study.\n6. **How is the event documented?** We do record the call. We take notes and will publish one or more writeups. For this, we will adhere to Chatham House rules: we mention what people said, but not who said what in case of participants. The chat will be saved temporarily, for the purposes of completing the writeups, but not shared, and deleted as the writeups are published.\n 7. **Will the research be published?** One or more writeups will appear on https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364. Writeups will be attributed to their authors, not the participants. That is an open forum, so participants are welcome to use it to comment, respond, or contribute their own writeups. The whole content of the public-facing forum(including the mentioned writeup, and any discussion about them) will then become the basis for at least one research report. We also hope to publish one or more journal article. If you would like to be a co-author, we are in principle open for it. Please contact *Maria Kling* (contact info below).\n8. **Who is organising and funding the research?** The research is organised by Edgeryders and funded by the European Union via a research project called [NGI Forward ](https://research.ngi.eu/).\n9. **Who do I contact if I have a concern about the study or I wish to complain?** You can contact *Maria Kling* Community Manager at Edgeryders via emailing them at *maria.euler@edgeryders.eu*.", "created_at": "2020-10-13 13:43:09.292143", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 16:04:48.559696", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 596, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26415, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 2565, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>\"There is no away\"</b>\n\nThis ipad just ate a really extensive post about new bits of science and what that implies for our real world systems who still act according to traditional methods, it took a look at sub absolute temperatire and negative temperature effects at that systemic level and indicated that bringing these effects to human scale would trounce the laissez-destroy policies of the modern state by exposing the incomplete foundation of their ideological basis as a kind of willful ignorance and stubborn holding on to incomplete pictures of reality.\n\nI'm sorry that I have deficient technology that eats my treeasure all to frequently, hopefully I can come across a new computer soon.

There is no \"best\"; there may be \"best adapted to this society\"... or there may still be several choices, depending on the variations among the population.\nFor current USA, I have hope for a couple of ideas: one is associated with Social Credit Theory, intitially developed by C.H.Douglas in the 1920s, and used by Robert Heinlein in his first, never published until 2003, 1939 novel \"For Us, The Living\". The idea is that much of physical capital is built from previously patented ideas for which the patent has expired. The income from this intellectual property is properly owned by the nation as a whole. It should form the basis of a tax called \"Social Credit\", which can be distributed to every citizen as income by virtue of belonging to that society.\nA second idea is that promulgated by Henry George in his 1879 work \"Progress and Poverty\", and worked into a science fiction work in 1895 by S. Byron Welcome: \"From Earth\u2019s Center: A Polar Gateway Message.\" This is that land is, again, the patrimony of the nation, not of individuals, who did not and cannot own it permanently -- they can only extract value from it by virtue of their labor -- therefore the portion of the value of their production which appertains to the productivity of the land itself should be taxed and distributed to the general population.\nThird is from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's 1840 book \"What is Property?\" Proudhon argued for a labor-based theory of value -- it meant that Locke's idea that property can be \"owned\" permanently because one person at one point used it to add value to their labor makes no sense -- sure, that person has a right to the value of the products made using their labor, but the underlying value added by non-human (out of patent) resources should accrue to the society as a whole, and there can be no nonsensical permanent and total ownership of land or capital.\nThese ideas provide a strong philosophically justifiable foundation for an economy in which everyone partakes of the value of their labor, and so has incentive to produce, but in which everyone has an income simply because they are members of that society. This ends poverty, but incentivizes work and creativity. <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-11-24 05:38:14.522575", "updated_at": "2020-11-24 05:38:14.522575", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 74.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 8, 4, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37790, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 7363, "post_number": 11, "raw": "\nWhile waiting for Nadia to share us with the estimated budget we can try to write the project together and apply for funds, check this ( http://bit.ly/2y6Awdd) and ask for sponsorship, during the workshop there are members who already have an established association right ? \n Please d o not hesitate to ask for help I highly recommend you  in addition to study the different financing possibilities to structure the project and put it in its frame  why the festival?

I am a Biology Engineer. I was one of the participants in the innovation camp that took place in Medenine in the late December 2017, where I got introduced to this outstanding community of Edgeryders.\n\nThis experience was rewarding on so many levels. I had the opportunity to interact with amazing people and discovering that we share the same ideas and passions.\n\nYet the biggest outcome was finding the courage to start my own initiative: creating a biohacking space. It was an excellent fit for me since I have been having these thoughts and ideas of practising biology out of the academic context from the day I graduated. Special thanks to @anique.yael who enlightened me to this new practice.\n\nSo my idea for this project is to create a Biohacking space where I can introduce Biology to normal people, with a focus on kids who would be interested to dig deep into it and really get to the bottom of something they want to understand that has to deal with either their body or their ecosystem in order to help them improve their life ([link for Prezi presentation](https://prezi.com/view/UrFQ5pynNkkGCpMoizCx/)). I want to be among the best but since I am a newbie in this field, I definitely need help from expertise, someone who has a sound knowledge in biohacking and here comes the magic of Edgeryders community: I got to meet @winnieponcelet here in Tunisia.\n\nIt was a fruitful encounter. We had the chance to share ideas and discuss different aspects of the project. By telling him what set of skills that I think I need to acquire in order to launch my initiative the right way, he pointed out the best practices to lead this project successfully and clarified many misunderstanding that I had in terms of defining the purpose of my project and establishment of my goals. He also shared with me how he started his initiative and the different stages that he went through and what are the obstacles he overcomes to achieve his success. All of this gave me a great help to organise my mess of ideas and to try putting them into actions.\n\nI had also the pleasure to give him walking tour in the old city of Sidi Bousaid and the ancient Carthage where we explored the remaining ruins of the once mighty Phoenician city of Carthage and enjoy the beautiful sightseeing and to take in the atmosphere of a glorious long-gone past era. It is definitely one of the top things to do when visiting Tunis.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fe96449c49efd750cae9917529fd31ffeb1ba64c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"383\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e38c4c51ed57dc1a382536577416c96169487466.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"381\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aed136e30a532b1ff1d2bb8224bfade8ee627ff3.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"516\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fdb2ffd5f644ede351fb2ec9ffed48c65b7338ca.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"383\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a53feb263186be06f579a7e410de9ec0b6001212.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"516\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b0d26b65923c674485446490bf21cb04e4875e96.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"516\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f07db88c726207d718de429312a29da7aa5b3d2a.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"383\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3513bb61e6bf554ae1a98c1401c0885535344c7.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"516\">\n\nFinally, I am looking forward to connecting with more people here and share ideas and why not collaborate on future projects. @winnieponcelet again thank you so much for providing me with such valuable advices and hopefully, I can meet you again in Brussels and learn more.", "created_at": "2018-01-26 21:20:07.830037", "updated_at": "2018-01-27 13:11:24.077602", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 587, "wiki": false, "reads": 40, "score": 568.0, "like_count": 18, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3362, 4034, 3704, 4, 2915, 4040, 1935, 3782, 4265, 3904, 3942, 3729, 3708, 3, 3703, 4085, 4263], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23439, "user_id": 2546, "topic_id": 4566, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>So we have the power!</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/swarup\">@swarup</a>,\n\nI really enjoyed reading your article!

I described examples -- to the best of my knowledge -- of initiatives we thought were worth examining.</li>\n\n<li>The interview gave me the opportunity to go over the problem we faced with the need to spend money on non-partner initiatives. Antonella perfectly understood what I meant -- and of course, she is not in a position to change things -- and told me about sad stories ... where people in the end were not payed although they did comply and implemented solutions they were suggested ... (That made me think our actual plan B probably the most\u00a0secure option).</li>\n\n<li>I said a word about collective intelligence, seen as a concept around which many of us work. Explained that in our case\u00a0collective intelligence either built around discussion forum (ER) or in a physical room.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe interview lasted a little less than an hour, and I understood it was meant as a first contact -- from which we should not expect much, but to link with CHIC.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-15 09:23:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.502962", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 431, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41456, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8024, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Ladies (and Winnie) this is fantastic news.

The issues you've highlighted are fundamental to creating organisations that generate health as well as other forms of value. I'm really curious about the link between your involvement in CIN & anxiety level. I'm guessing there are clues there that relate to the theme I'm exploring - the conditions that generate health within our organisations. It sounds like these conditions are generating ill health.\nI see this as connected to the issue of balancing the needs of the individuals and the needs of the collective/group/org and collaborating around strategies so that a broader range of these are met while at the same time its true that its not often feasible to meet all needs at all times. Greater attention paid to needs as a normal part of our operations would be one way forward. \nI'm also interested in how we might create organisational structures that are much more capable of functioning _around_ individuals ability to function. The organisation I work for receives many referrals who are skilled and talented people who aren't able to hold down paid work because of health issues of various kinds. Yet often what they want _more than_ 'help' is contexts where they feel their skills are valued, where they can contribute when they are able and find support when they are not. Often this means not having someone trying to 'fix you' and perpetually asking if you're okay which can just draw your attention to how 'not ok' you're feeling. At one point we considered implementing a badge system - to indicate to others our internal state - a kind of 'leave me alone - its enough to know you're there'.\nBut we haven't done that and we are only able to take people as referrals or as volunteers which feels like it falls short.\nThank you for bringing such a personal and interesting dimension to this discussion.

The import procedure is needed to build a neo4j database containing users, posts and ethno tags from which the different views are fed.\n\n>The procedure starts from a tag, allowing to grab topics attached to this tag. Topics contain a stream of posts incrementally numbered as they are published. Posts also have a unique identifier number. Fields in the post allow to detect whether the post initiated the topic or whether it is a reply to the initial post or to another post (previously called comment).\n\n>PB \nPosts can be withdrawn (by the author). But the reply_to field of incoming posts (replies) is not updated (ex. 37600 post #10 in topic 7263, leaving 37601 and others with no posts to point at). This breaks the reply_to structure from which the social graph is built.\n\nThis was also present in Drupal, and is fundamental. Users need to be free to delete their content. By convention, if a  post points to a deleted post, we make it point to the post number 1 in the same topic. \n\n>Annotations are somewhat a bit more tricky.\n\n>Discourse allows to grab annotations attached to a topic. But then launching multiple queries raises a limit exceeded exception. We are thus left with the necessity to grab *all* annotations (even those not relevant to the starting tag). This is not a problem for now as there are not too many tags. It is just not a good and sustainable strategy (if ER is to multiply the number of projects as it certainly will).\n\n@matthias, does this make sense to you?  \n\n>PB\n>Many annotations have no associated ethno tag. That is, they have their tag_id set to null. We have not exhaustively look at all the data \u2014 there are many hundreds of cases \u2014 but it seems that annotations consisting of a single word may correspond to ethno tags themselves. But in that case, the presumed ethno tag could be attached to the whole post (?), as opposed to a part of the post content.\n\n>You may have an explanation for this.\n\nI'm getting confused. I use \"code\" to refer to ethno codes, and \"tag\" for Discourse tags. I suppose you mean ethno codes by \"ethno tags\" in the above. If so, it looks like a pretty sloppy way to code, because there is no attempt to identify when informants are using different vocabularies to convey the same meaning. But then I am no ethnographerm and may be wrong. @amelia, @Digitalanthropology, what's your call? \n\n>This may have some impact on the resulting tag co-occurrence graph (if we are unlucky, tags induced from annotations with tag_id = null may well be isolated ethno tags, thus contributing no edge in the co-occurrence graph).  \n\nThat would mean either that the underlying ontology is not well-maintained or that there really are disjoint codes. In the former case, it's back to a second or third pass of coding. In the latter case, we have to live with it.", "created_at": "2017-11-29 17:45:57.481202", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 02:34:16.329840", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 76.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86121, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14733, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I can't make this Wednesday -- we go into full lockdown at midnight on Wednesday and I have a lot to take care of before it hits. \n\nMy updates:\n\n1.

I've been developing a proposal for the call with my colleague Flora and in discussion with Alberto and Hugi. From the call, no one seemed keen to lead, though possible people have just not spoken up. Hard to get a sense. Climate KIC said they would reconsider leading but need to speak internally, and would reach out to everyone with a map of the terrain for each call in terms of who was interested in what.

Instead of trying to change the world to fit my life I changed my life to fit my world. Instead of looking for a way to make money to live the live I was immersed in I have moved into a life where money plays a much smaller part. I have become \"rich\" by adjusting to my environment. It has been at least (if not more) about surrendering to that which is, as it was about creating new things.\n\nThis has put me in a place where I have space and time to dedicate to other things I care about. For example, to partaking in this dialogue (and others like it) and travelling to Italy to meet.\n\nI have watched my relatively poor neighbors (Romanian villagers) and from them I learned a practical aspect of giving: it is easier to give something you have a lot of ... from a place of abundance.

All your projects, your ideas, your courage, your gestures of care, your incredible initiatives of change\u2026 WOW. Simply being with this is nourishing. \n\nAnd so in an aligned way, there are multiple pathways in which I\u2019m experiencing care to share. While some of the language may seem a little abstract at times, the essence is practical and inclusive. So I invite you to walk with me a moment through some of my explorations of care and towards a shared possibility at OpenVillage...\n\nAn apt start are the personal practices, such as what I call _\u201ctending to the fray\u201d_ : : the act of witnessing myself falling apart. The acceptance that fraying at the edges can be generative and liberating, and that sometimes we just need to give space to our unravelling in order to grow. \n\nThrough to my research in shifting our thinking around what \u201ccare\u201d actually is \n: : referencing post-feminist psychoanalytics and decolonialism to explore an \u201cexpanded self\u201d  rather than you-me power dynamics that drive so much of how we understand care. \n\nOn to practicing commons-based living and a refusal of neoliberal mechanisms of power\n: :  where collaborative initiatives unleash sustainable pathways, where the many facets of care cycle around and where people of all walks of life can move beyond the limits of capitalist \u201clabour\u201d towards individual, collective and planetary wellbeing.\n\nAnd through and with much more of how care is lived in the worlds I encounter.\n\nSo as a part of Open Village\u2019s \u201crevolutionary care\u201d theme, I wanted to offer an evolved version of a project I experimented with at Elsewhere: a living museum last year. If our community and the festival curators agree, then it will be a simple and subtle installation that festival go-ers can engage with at their own pace and within their own limits. \n\n**_\u201cCaring through uselessness\u201d_ is a shared reflection on how in order to reimagine postures, mechanisms and systems of care, we sometimes need to render what we know useless.** The experience of letting go of what one knows in order to move into a new paradigm - both at an individual and systemic level - can be disruptive, divisive and induce paralysing fear. It refers to \u201cuse\u201d not in terms of resourcefulness but rather how the dominant frames of reference for \"useful\" are based on unjust capitalist notions of utility. **_Caring through uselessness_ offers itself as a companion to this process of moving beyond outdated notions of care.** \n\nIt appropriates a psychological notion of the \"transitional object\" and \"transitional phenomena\" developed by D.W. Winicott. Examples are teddy bears, thumbsucking, rabbits, the mother\u2019s breast, the mother herself. Winicott talks about the \u2018transitional object\u2019 as the first not-me relation, as the first possession, as the comforter. I believe that as changemakers we need to make sure we care for ourselves as we care for change. Akin to much shared in other stories and the festival\u2019s whole framing, I believe that as changemakers we have the opportunity and indeed responsibility to engage in practicing new paradigms of care as we address new mechanisms of care. \n\nIf accepted as an apt and quiet offering at Openvillage, _Caring through uselessness_ will install a curated selection of hand-held found objects - discarded pieces deemed useless - for attendees to pick up and take with them to the talks, panels, conversations, walks and encounters of the festival. Think a tin, a keyring chain, a plastic fork, a battery, a bracelet\u2026 **These objects are offered as care companions for you. A little, quiet, personal and mobile site to host you in your own process of care and the many movements of Openvillage.** \n\nRegardless of what unfolds with _Caring through uselessness_, please feel free to introduce yourself to me here or at the festival if you\u2019d like to share in some space with these ideas and practices. \n\nWith care, in solidarity :tulip:", "created_at": "2017-10-11 11:27:17.209410", "updated_at": "2018-05-09 16:18:23.734675", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 664, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 234.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3367, 3613, 2569, 4061, 145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38162, "user_id": 3613, "topic_id": 7400, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Really like this idea @anique - its important to create ways to form a relationship with these themes that take us out of the 'head' and into embodied spaces.

Fear of the future, working and paid from civil society but at some point you will have to find a \u201creal job\u201d\n* Entrepreneurial spirit & Corrupting influence of funding: people no longer trust the international organisations, especially since a lot of money was coming into finance daesh, via mosques.\n\n**_What each participant said about themselves?_**\n\n**Ahmed:**\n_Cards: Core Values, Solution, Budget._ \n\n_**_**Q: How do we change the educational system that we have?**_**_ \n\n@Yosser: \u201cAhmed talked about loving what you do, picking something which you love to learn. His experience with the civil society- he found what he loved in it---you can work on it that there is a fear about the future, that you will not be able to do it in th future. Like being hired in an organisation, the peter principle...and when you ar promoted you can no longer work on what you love. once you fnd you can find your own peace of mind you can become more productive and help others.\u201d\n\nHow do you keep your values while offering the solution..and how to maintain a healthy budget that goes with your values? \n\nI've been hearing people are working on something that they don't love, that they are chosing the major at University based on the name, not its content.  How do we develop an education system that respects the persons' needs and not the needs of a system that has been here for 40 years and that creates unemployment all the time? \n\n**Amine**  \n_Cards: Profit, Solution and Reach out tactics._ \n\n**Q: How do I get retired at the age of 40 so that I will do things I really like to do?** \n\nI am not the only schizophrenic person in this room : There is a big difference between what we are studying and what we want to do. I thought it was only me, but I found out that there are many people who fear that change, that want to stick with what they are comfortable with/stable situation. \n\nProfit because when I do things I love I don't think about budget. Reach out tactics: I have a lot of projects that I think are useful for people but I don't know how to market them. Example: teacher substitution problems in school - I came up with a solution for myself and gave it to my school. But I didn't go beyond that. Also have made a route planner - faste. I create things but I don't think about tactics and how to sell them and market them...because I do them for fun. I want to find solutions for other people's problems without ignoring the sustainability and marketing part.\n\n**Randa** \n\n**Q: How do I...**\nI am a textile engineer - trained as it but am not working at the moment. For the moment I have mixed feelings. Fortunately we know what we love. Unfortunately it's maybe not exactly what we learned at university, what we graduated as. This causes unhappiness and disequilibrium and fear. This is our situation. I thought it was just me, that I am the only one. What I really want to do is mentoring and coaching others. \nMy passion is to help people, I feel such a great satisfaction when I do it.\nThe idea of an open village was not very clear for me, not sure if it is going to be just online or a place where we sleep and work. What I\u2019m doing right now [not sure what you are referring to...can you elaborate please] is really useful for Open Village.

Engineer in Electromechanics/ trader\nYour Health? Great! \nWhy choose \u201cmedicine\u201d card? Different tastes: want to do other things than my specialty.

If we have some people breaking the cycle. I like change- like not being sure about what the future holds for me. Resigned from public sector. Have a lot of ideas that I can put in service for this country, especially education and health- i think if we can fix this we can help people to fix everything else. The fixation on specific problems can help us to appreciate the other things we have.\n\nReach out tactics - I struggle alot with getting people motivated for the right reasons. E.g. with training go to training for trainers or debaters....we talk about all kinds of stuff to do with intrinsic value, but really people are there for funding. How to change that? Roles and responsibilities: the problem of having rigorous lines for each person's responsibilities- whole load of work on shoulders of small number of people...but then benefits are spread across everyone. Some people can say it's ok they don't mind but when time comes for credits then this can break teams and people.\n\n- What do you do right now?* Teacher (university) maths, and debate trainer.\n-  what is your \u201ccareer\u201d in sport? *I practice sports regularly since 20 years, different kinds of sport\n- what\u2019s the major problems in society in your view? * Education, Health and Transport\n-  How do you think these can be solved?* By working at many levels: public policy, social dialogue, inclusion of different actors, pressure on government, etc..\n-  What do you plan to do in the foreseeable future?* Be more active and engaged at the civil and political levels.\n\n**Sana** \n **Q: How do I leave my current job?**\n\nI am working as a designer in a big company and the Relationships at work at work are not great I am facing a lot of problems at work. \n\nWhat kind of problems with your director? Good relationship\nWhat kind of problems with your colleagues? They create problems for me with my boss\nHow much risk you can support? I can\u2019t support any risk, just I need lot of patience.\n \n@Sohayeb  \n_Cards: Value, Scalability._ \n\n**Q: How do we build a youth political party to win the next elections or the one after to make necessary reforms in our country?  How do we bring about reforms to make it simpler for young people to start new organisations/startups in Tunisia?** \n \nTrained as an engineer now working in Marketing. Many of us became engineers without knowing why we became engineers. After this conversation I believe even more in community. The certain thing is that there are people out there who are working on things, the problem is that these people are not connected in a way that these people can share knowledge, skills ...if they could come together the could change a lot of things. I think the open village shares this vision of making people come together and work together on local problems, and in this way to make change at global scale. \nHow to make sure that the things we are doing is bringing value to people and how to scale this from small community to a large community.   \n\n**Ahmed** \n\nAhmed talked about loving what you do, picking something which you love to learn. His experience with the civil society- he found what he loved in it---you can work on it that there is a fear about the future, that you will not be able to do it in th future. Like being hired in an organisation, the peter principle...and when you ar promoted you can no longer work on what you love. once you find you can find your own peace of mind you can become more productive and help others. \u201c\n Education: Love what you do / Passion / civil Society helps you find what you love (failure of educational system) / Commitment / Learn to help directly/indirectly / Communication (passionate) spread this culture for the sake of different regions /fear of the future (financial stability) / Peter principal ) / risk averse\n \n**Firas** \n_Card: Passion._ \n\n**Q: How do I create a work environment which supports people to achieve their mission?** \n\nMechatronics.engineer. After discussing with my new friends. We have a deep belief that we should make actions, we just have to do things. All of us have a lot of problems, tunisia has a lot of problems....how to make it better? this is what we have to discuss. \n\n \nHow to make passion, and how can I make a living from my passion. How can I create a company that I can live my passion and make money while doing it?\n \n**Iyed**\n_Cards: Time plan, profits and hazards_\n\n**Q: What I see is a lot of people are desperate in Tunisia. How can I succeed when so many people do not succeed? How do I make the world a better place to live in Tunisia? **\n**These problems need a lot of work. That work can creat a lot of opportunities. It can help us to create the jobs we want in all kinds of fields.** \n \n \n \n It's important to set your deadlines and how much you need. Hazards because you cannot make a lot of money without taking risks.\n \n**Yosser** \n_Cards: Employment and work ,Peace of mind and fear,Work_\n \n**Q: How do we change the educational system that we have?** \n\n The collective power we should all work together. Ahmed talked about loving what you do, picking something which you love to learn. His experience with the civil society- he found what he loved in it---you can work on it that there is a fear about the future, that you will not be able to do it in the future. Like being hired in an organisation, the peter principle...and when you are promoted you can no longer work on what you love. once you find you can find your own peace of mind you can become more productive and help others. \n \nI've been hearing people are working on something that they don't love, that they are choosing the major based on the name not content. How do we develop an education system that respects the person's' needs and not the needs of a system that has been here for 40 years and that creates unemployment all the time? Cards: Core Values, Solution, Budget. How do you keep your values while offering the solution..and how to maintain a healthy budget that goes with your value. \n \nEmployment and work: wants her own leader, to encourage people how to start their own projects. Sher wants to develop her personal skills. She want to develop her home town Medenine, start jobs there\nPeace of mind and fear: it encourage her to reach her limit and be part of open village to find people encouraging her, moral support\nWork: create jobs in Medenine, where there is no oppp and have to work in the capital Tunis. Create potential, for younger generation\n \n**Salma**\n_Cards : Pollution ,Health care ,Dynamism & collective commitment_\n\n**_Q:_ How can I\u2026**\n \nI want ourselves to be happy and find out comforts. That doesn't mean just fo us- we all want to live in better society - to improve our work, education and lifestyle. Improve ourselves. \n \n I believe that if I it cannot answer to all of these cards then what I do is useless/cannot make an impact.\n \nDynamism & collective commitment: together are united and stronger, we youth should be models for others and be leaders in our communities to show the other how we can do together.\n \nOur commitment: find solution for the daily problems\nHealth care: I\u2019m member of the ambulance in my community and I can see that people on our community not having the necessary health care, so we want to find simple solutions to provide the basic health care for free because it\u2019s become a luxury here in Tunisia\nHealth care is a basic necessary in our community and we should defend that right\nPollution: Tunisia is much polluted and that makes me very angry and my commitment is to find solution for that\n \nIf I will work in health care, pollution and commitment in the open village, it can help me a lot by living with people who support you every day and everybody is connected and support each other.\n\n**Mahmoud**\n\n_Cards: Roadmap, eliminating Distractions, Time plan._ \n\n**Q: In every job interview they ask you where do you see yourself in x number of years.

Neither Alberto or I take this view, instead believing that it depends what is being sold in the market.\u00a0\n\n2) We could the view that all markets are ethically good. I'm not sure anyone takes that view, or that any society has functioned in this way.\u00a0\n\n3) Instead Alberto and I take the view that whether a market is a socially desirable depends on what is being bought and sold. Neither of us support a free market in human lives or panda pelts (I'm assuming), but we do support a free market for potatoes. \u00a0\n\n4) Alberto believes that any market for a good with externalities, positive or negative, cannot function well, and therefore a wholly different model is required is these circumstances. The evidence of failures to reduce environmental externalities from economic activity supports this, as does evidence from health care systems around the world. Experience shows that, in practise, attempts to correct these markets are doomed.\n\n5) I'm thinking about the specific case of sharing small amounts of surplus time or resources within a localised community. Tracking who puts in and takes out would allow an exchange mechanism with some of the features of a market - whether it has that name or not - and that could enhance the sustainability of that model. Specifically, by reducing reliance on altruism. I think the possibility of correcting market failures is an open question, and in any case I'm not convinced you can generalise from national healthcare provision or global pollution to the local scale in question. If this is the case market heuristics are still a valuable part of the mix when exploring systems of local exchange.\u00a0\n\n6) It comes down to your judgement about the nature of existing market failures are the transferability of those lessons to other circumstances, which is discussed above.\n\nAddis sounds exciting!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-30 15:09:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.899648", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85703, "user_id": 6339, "topic_id": 14626, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Regarding the structuration of actions/activites (also: activism), shouldn't we write - here? - all codes we have for those actions?

Rightly, he demands a well-defined question. Here's my take.\n\n<strong>We investigate the size and scope (both in physical space and disciplinary space) of the phenomenon of participatory diagnosis</strong>. Folk knowledge tells us use Wikipedia and other Internet resources to diagnose their own conditions, or cross-check a diagnosis made by a physician. The question is: how widespread is the phenomenon? By looking at pageview counts, we can already get unexpected results. I did NOT expect that 95% of all English-language pages in WikiProject: Medicine would be viewed in a randomly chosen hour. Nor did I expect that the top pages would draw 500 hits in an hour. As we refine the query with geographical and other information, we might learn more interesting stuff.\n\nBut also, this is a rhetorical move. It is meant to draw attention of policy makers and health professionals on collective intelligence. Wikipedia is built by a community, and used by a community. Collective intelligence is already an important player in care: so, people should pay attention to OpenCare.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-06 11:03:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.545916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 199, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88079, "user_id": 6728, "topic_id": 14773, "post_number": 90, "raw": "**I want to take part in the webinar.** <br /> Yes <br /><br /> **My idea/suggestion for building the world:** <br /> How would communication work over long distances and enforcing contracts\nWhat currencies (or currency substitutes e. g. bartering systems) might spread out societies use <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-12-03 06:45:34.575504", "updated_at": "2020-12-03 06:45:34.575504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 29.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87053, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14624, "post_number": 10, "raw": "id say you need people to have filled in the comment space/get it. active already before we hit the go button on communication and outreach campaign.

I do still feel that I need to better understand how a Fraternitas actually operates in our context however, so looking forward to talking about that more with you @nadia @alberto and others.  It reminds me of what @gehan said in the opening panel of OpenVillage Festival around the importance of \"power literacy\" rather than trying to create new infrastructures. I'm also curious as to how decolonial, anti-capitalist and post-feminist thinking enters into our referencing of the Fraternitas, if that's even relevant?\n\nIn addition to techniques for building trust and respecting limits of care, I'd be very interested in talking more about the spectrum of decision making processes that are emerging in allied movements and where they fit with Edgeryders form and growth. For example, at Percolab, a cooperative where I also collaborate, they engage in generative decision making processes which are based on consent rather than consensus. I feel like this works for sure, but needs to be flexible and is not always appropriate. The research lab where I used to be based resisted any kind of decision making processes and chose \"emergent responses\" instead - as a consequence often decisions ended up being made almost autocratically, simply by those people that happened to be in the room with the Director - which clearly doesn't work either. And I recently was responsible for developing a decision-making matrix for The School of Making Thinking which was a super interesting process but in the end isn't actually overtly being applied. I'm curious as to what is the threshold between discerning and mobilsing around the organisation's principles here.

I have a dream of one united world, with one spoken language which will be, according to Paulo Coelho's expression, the language of the world. With this huge number of languages, dialects and differences in the world, I do believe that we can speak one meduim understandable language though. My academic career leads me to find out what a humanity need to keep in contact and communicate away from my english major which, for me, represents a simple tool to arrive to the key to communication. So the question in here is what can be a language of the world? The answer is something that we all as human beings, can speak innately.\nCan't we speak and share love and peace? Yes we do, and I do believe that with peace we will achieve a half-way towards that dream-world. Thus, I took part of the foundation team of Peace Lab Medenine Club. The club is an anti-violence project as a whole, thus, the different axes that we are working on are: peace building and conflict resolution and transformation. Within our club, we believe that peace is an important issue to work on Especially after the terrorist movements and the appearance of the Islamic state. Such phenomenon that speaks the language of violence can be only defeated by peaceful tools and this is what we are working on. Within our club, we push and help youth to look for their inner peace as a first step through taking advantage of their skills, talents and passions and through working on improving them. Therefore, we managed a meeting for bookaholics with a great tunisian author such as Khaoula Hosni and a lovely booktuber Amal bedhiefi to share the participants such a passion. Communication, as well, is an effective way in order to maintain peace, this is why organizing a public speaking workshop along a metanoia journey was one of the fruitful missions that we we are still proud of. We believe that the current state of our Tunisia is a little bit complicating but with attempting to decifer codes we find it quite simple as peace and communication will be surely the very effective solutions. I often tend to work on the same matters as a member with JCI Medenine.\nIn order to connect people together and keep them in contact, I have a dream-project to create a Global Language Village Model. As mentioned previously, language of a particular folk is the key to penetrate into its culture and secrets. As a start, I want to create an open-minded community by setting such a village in Medenine. Basically, it will be a kind of a school for language learning in which trainers will be some foreigners or if it's better to say natives: A british or american trainer for english, a spanish for spanish, a german for german, etc... this is how we can create an atmosphere of cultural exchange which will be ensured by a diversity of cultural clubs and activities such as: theatre, music, dance, storytelling, etc...\nSo people, all around the world ! give peace a chance and come on join me enjoying my dream-world.", "created_at": "2017-11-30 20:11:47.171071", "updated_at": "2018-01-08 11:58:39.246857", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 229.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 1935, 3812, 2915, 3703, 4252, 4267], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77699, "user_id": 6433, "topic_id": 13190, "post_number": 24, "raw": "Thanks all.

Speaking personally, our daughter is 2 years old, so she needs a lot of attention, it's almost impossible to leave her alone except for the odd 5-10 minutes she's entertaining herself. So during this pandemic when child care was closed, really only one person in the household can get meaningful work done. We made up for it by working around her schedule (early early morning and late nights), but it is challenging to say the least.\n\nTechnology can help keep her occupied, and letting her watch videos on the ipad is something she loves and regularly asks for, but everytime I do it, I feel like a failed parent. If she was older, I think this feeling would not be so strong, but as she is still a toddler, we try to keep her away from screens as much as is possible. \n\nToday we're lucky that child care is back, but of course it's only a matter of time that the children will be sent to home quarantine for a few days or weeks. This is looming over everything, so we try to count our blessings now to be ready when that happens.\n\nI'd be very curious to hear how others with children in this age range use technology around their children.

How would we do this without requiring people to set up another account somewhere else?[/quote]\n\nThat's a nice idea actually. Especially since Reef could sell things like unbooked event space to community members. You can control who is able to pay with coupons by adding them to your \"network\" on PayCoupons or not, so it does not compete with normal business operations. Buyers will need a PayCoupons account obviously, but the shop can perhaps be integrated with our existing Drupal site if we find a lightweight module for that (so no need for yet another account). After selecting \"PayCoupons\" as payment option, people would be shown a message like \"Please pay \u2026 EUR to PayCoupons user \u2026 . As soon as we receive your payment, your order will be shipped.\" The code of the normal advance bank payment option can be reused to get that done, so it's not difficult. However for now there is no PayPal-style forwarding to PayCoupons for doing the payment after the purchase. That comfort will have to wait a bit :)\n\n[quote=\"nadia, post:10, topic:5866\"]How does it work if I only want to buy something from the shop, but don't want to offer anything yet?[/quote]\n\nThis is not the normal mode of operation since PayCoupons is not a credit management system (like Ripple of mutual credit currencies). However there are two ways:\n\n* The shop may agree to accept the user's own coupons as payment, instead of the shop's own coupons. This is equivalent to recording a credit relationship.

Last year I organized a series of meetings in Utrecht, The Netherlands. First they were about Free living and money, later they were about freedom and transforming trauma's through awareness as I felt a desire to treat a more direct approach about individual transformation. I call these meetings \"Circles of openness\".\u00a0\n\nSome of the meetings were extremely fruitful and transformative. Others were okay and sometimes a bit boring. What determined the quality of the meetings was the openess and willingness to share from an honest and authentic place, and to really be curious to share what feels exciting and challenging to someone. During the meetings where the mayority of the participants was willing to listen and feel into what's relevant at that time, there was a magical openness and connection among the group. I truly enjoyed these meetings and they were one of the most beautiful shared moments of my life. What I also enjoyed is the power to transform through awareness. By expressing a doubt or a challenge and openly looking at it, it became possible to take distance from the perspective and let go of it. Also the awareness of the group seemed to stimulate and hold space for sharing these vulnerable perspectives.\u00a0\n\nWhat didn't work so well was:\n\n- when people spoke in general terms and theoretically/ hypothetically without really feeling the question.\u00a0\n\n- when people didn't really want to be there\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat did work well was:\u00a0\n\n- sharing from your own experience\n\n- listening and asking questions to explore the perspective\n\n- holding space: being open to the perspective without taking it personally, listening with from an open space\n\n- using a talking stick, so one could speak at the time.\u00a0\n\n- a good host and facilitator who's comfortable with (almost) everything and ready to set some guidelines, such as: speaking from the heart, speaking from your personal experience, no interuptions and the talking stick.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn my experience these circles of openness help build relationships of trust and create a vital space for transformation.\u00a0\n\nLet me know if you want to find out more. I'm playing with the idea to organize new \"Circles of openness\" over the next months.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nWarm regards,\u00a0\n\nEwoud\n\n@Noemi you might find this interesting!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-13 14:59:03", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 07:59:25.825651", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 121.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85399, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 14629, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Excellent will distribute today,", "created_at": "2020-10-20 10:41:32.019615", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 10:41:32.019615", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85386], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39830, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7772, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I would really love to come and help with the community workshop, but I will have to leave it in Noemi's very capable hands and hope I see you over there soon.", "created_at": "2017-11-30 21:33:05.630270", "updated_at": "2017-11-30 21:33:05.630270", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 34, "score": 96.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [39826], "is_liked_by": [3703, 3812, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38698, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7547, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@anu have a look, these are the slides you are looking for :) Lots to learn for OpenVillage House Kathmandu in there.", "created_at": "2017-10-24 20:31:28.078431", "updated_at": "2017-10-24 20:31:28.078431", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 52.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30909, "user_id": 87, "topic_id": 1298, "post_number": 36, "raw": "<b>Tremendous feedback, thank you Nadia!</b>\n\nAll great points that are truly appreciated.\u00a0As the person that put it together it is too easy to miss all of these really imporant points.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://citizensinthelab.com/page/the-map\">On my site I</a> have said the following, does this give enough insight or does it fall short?\n\n<blockquote>Help us spotlight the best efforts happening at local and national levels. <a href=\"http://www.communitywalk.com/citizensforchange#10120010664.3RP7-71.3d910\" target=\"_blank\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">Login to CommunityWalk</font></u></a> and add key individuals or organizations, innovation centers, NGOs, co-working spaces, etc...\n\nIf you have a large \\# of entries to add, consider downloading this <a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/dTb0CNJ6C3tDd8Ge00J9UUe6GlYFDbeCr8B-uQ5fupcwVMVGS-ZvmIx6IyyePPhwifmzAArYgKX890GVTz28549W1Qaiqsuf/CommunityWalk.csv\" target=\"_self\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">CommunityWalk.csv</font></u></a>, a CSV that is easier to bulk edit.

The idea behind autoimmune diseases is that they may be genetic or may be caused by what we, as human actors, are doing to our environment. So, while Canaries are particularly\naffected / sensitive, they are a litmus test of what is happening more broadly.

Why don\u2019t we create libraries, new kinds of libraries where knowledge and research are promoted in more welcoming spaces?

(e.g \"ensur_complian\", \"effic\")? The list is not a cluster (there are no relationships between the terms in the list, necessarily), it is just the terms that co-occur with that top term most frequently, correct?\n\nThere are a lot of similar codes that we could compare -- and see if the clusters look different (ours is a network of co-occurrences, so a bit different). But I'll show you some of ours and see if you think the comparative would be of interest. \n\nLet's look at your term \"covid-19_pandem\"\n\nhere's where our COVID-19 code is in the co-occurrence network: \n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 11.42.03|690x499](upload://zplzmL1mwgow4pSSAm8ZDp0Ql11.png) \n\nand here it is in its own ego network, with lower-level co-occurrences filtered out, leaving only the codes that most frequently co-occur with `COVID-19` (so, perhaps a better comparison to your data): \n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 11.44.24|690x538](upload://4B8fGzwZS3xqynmlmUTPFB1ja5I.png) \n\nWhen we look at the ego network, we can see some overlaps with your data:\n\n* `social distancing`, perhaps unsurprisingly. This concept is connected to social distance itself and its impacts -- in the ego network, you can see codes like `losing human touch` and `working remotely` (and responses to the negative effects of those impacts, like `co-working`, `co-living` and `community-building`). These could relate to your term \"particip\", potentially. I also am guessing that your term \"earlier this\" might refer to people making comparisons to how things were before the pandemic (though hard to say), which relates to the concept of \"rapid_chang\". \n\nLet's turn to that one, \"rapid_chang\". We have the code `adapting to new circumstances`, which is related. Here's that ego network:\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 11.54.58|690x522](upload://AeBOWsrndPvrf0Ig1jjx6D0NaIB.png) \n\nI see overlaps here, too. \"collabor\", I assume is related to collaboration, a response to rapid change. We have codes like `connecting people`, `organising events`, and `community building` (to create a `sense of community`) as ways of adapting to new circumstances(related to your \"new normal\").  `resilience` is a code we have as well, just outside of this co-occurrence level, that I know is increasing further as we are coding now (you can see `anxiety` in ours, too, so there is a sense of having to keep it together for increasing lengths of time in the face of `uncertainty`, another code).\n\nWe also have `working remotely`, like your \"remot_work.\" I imagine \"mandatori\" has to do something with the required safety measures like `lockdown`, `ppe`, and `cleaning`. \n\nYour \"rapid change\" seems to refer to two things: the pace of technological change (digital transformation, app) and covid-19 related change. Heading back to the co-occurrence network, we can see these two kinds of change being discussed by our participants, too. `imagining alternatives` is connected to `tech adaptation` (not unlike your \"digital transformation\") and `app`. \n\n[Uploading: Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 12.07.35.png...]() \n\nI'm also interested to see what the addition of the sentiment analysis does, and see if the theory we have about negative/positive meaning usually being clear contextually bears out in practice when we compare (/if adding any element of sentiment analysis way down the road makes any sense for us -- we talked about this at one Masters of Networks with @melancon and one of the LaBri students). If I recall correctly, when we saw the sentiment analysis his student did applied to one of the OpenCare threads, it didn't accurately capture the nuance -- but that was a different method of course.\n\nInterested to see how we could make further comparisons going forward! I'd love to understand how you theorise why the co-occurrences exist (how you explain why terms are connected, from the perspective of the people making the connections, and explanation of the social phenomenon giving rise to them). I'm always interested in how to move from the co-occurrences to explaining what gave rise connections themselves/what story they tell.", "created_at": "2020-10-20 11:12:33.301611", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 11:13:09.709944", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 718, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85340], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38805, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7567, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-27 09:26:40.295908", "updated_at": "2017-10-27 09:26:40.295908", "deleted_at": "2018-03-09 17:10:58.726189", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3757], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84757, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 4, "raw": "![freelancer childcare event flyer|690x318](upload://6OzgfKE6Frx6hXTg12KhRZpPT0x.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-10-12 13:39:12.696118", "updated_at": "2020-10-12 13:42:59.061052", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 54.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6442, 6701], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34915, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 6783, "post_number": 2, "raw": "HI all, I'm back from a restful and nourishing summer break.\n\nThe Complex Networks conference is quite close, probably too close in time to write a satisfactory multi-disciplinary paper.

Solutions, We Need Solutions <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nWe are fed up with an economic setup that exploits us (\"massive inequality\") and [destroys nature](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix125/4605229). We're also peaceful people, and work on peaceful solutions \u2013 don't worry, governments, and [welcome to join forces](/t/id/38). We need solutions though! The solution that seems most promising to us so far is _\"OpenVillage\"_: a network of enjoyable live-and-work spaces in which each OpenVillage house is both financially sustainable (\"it solves our money issues\"), technologically sustainable (\"we have all we need\"), fully ecologically sustainable (\"no adverse effects on the environment\") and even eco-restorative (\"restoring degraded and polluted ecosystems\").\n\nOf course we can't save the Planet. But we can show how to save the Planet _if enough people join_. That makes OpenVillage a long-term vision for the Planet that does not require (but of course welcomes) support from policy makers.\n\nTo be taken seriously, we have to estimate and measure the impact. OpenVillage solutions come in multiple levels, and each one reduces impacts by 90% over the previous one. So in the first level of solutions, we won't achieve full ecological sustainability yet, but envision that a reduction of 90% compared to the average per-capita values in Western Europe, in the following areas:\n\n* electrical energy consumption from the grid\n* water consumption from the grid\n* fossil fuel consumption for heating, cooking, transportation (as proxy for carbon dioxide emissions)\n* food consumption from markets (esp. of remote origin)\n* food waste\n* plastic waste\n* residual waste\n* money spent on cost of living (incl. tech investments distributed over projected use times)\n* money spent for leisure\n\nIn other words, Solutions Level 1 will be a sustainability improvement of one order of magnitude, purely with DIY solutions. Doing the same in Level 2 will be a total improvement of 2 orders of magnitude, or a 99% impact reduction. At that point, we'll have a lifestyle that can be considered \"sustainable\".\n\nEven that is just not enough anymore, given the current conditions of the Planet's ecosystems. We also have to restore what we and others damaged before. So we have restoration tools in every level, but also a Solutions Level 3 with the target to offset the damage done by the same amount of people with typical 2017 European lifestyles, and a Solutions Level 4 scaling that effect up by one order of magnitude (so one person offsets the damage done by ten). Let's aspire to be net-benefit humans :slight_smile: \n\nBut that's the future. Right now, we gotta get to work and create the solutions we need. We'll collect them all in the list below.\n\n\n## 2. Requirements <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nFor the start, our solutions directory will only contain solutions for a first, limited level of sustainability of OpenVillage houses. While we like the \"full-stack autarky approach\" of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/), it's too much for us to start. We'll rather start from a limited, ready to use set of solutions and gradually add more to make OpenVillage more sustainable and more autarkic. Anyway, even the below set of less than 40 solutions allows full energy, water and food self-sustainability, self-management and free communications.\n\nThe requirements for this first set of solutions are as follows:\n\n1. **DIY and open source.** All solutions must be possible to self-manufacture in a small workshop from ubiquitous materials (found in nature, in trash and from industrial production). To be DIY, instructions to manufacture have to be open source, obviously.\n\n2. **Scalable from 5-20 people.** OpenVillage houses come in various sizes, so solutions developed here should work for all of them. (For communal living projects in rented residential housing, 5-20 inhabitants seems reasonable to expect. Larger property can be sub-divided accordingly.)\n\n3. **Easy to transport.** As a side effect of living in rented property, and to be able to relocate nationally and internationally in case of crises, all solutions have to be lightweight and easily transportable. Ideally in Eurobox boxes (60\u00d740 cm, 80\u00d760 cm), where not possible on EPAL pallets (120\u00d780 cm). For equipment mobility in times of crisis, the chosen host country's customs system should not make exporting an organization's equipment hard or expensive. Normally this is not much of a problem, as governments like exporting \u2026 avoiding customs when importing is the big issue.\n\n4. **Efficient replication.** None of the solutions we need is groundbreaking super-innovative technology. What we need is solutions that can be applied in a simple and fast way \u2013 so we need good documentation in standardized formats, not the \"bits and pieces\" already present all over the Net.\n\n5. **Minimum need for money.** OpenVillage houses must be applicable worldwide, _literally_. This includes areas where people have very limited financial means to spend on cost of living and to invest in technological solutions. To provide decent living conditions for all inhabitants, we need solutions that (1) allow very minimal recurring costs of living that needs to be paid in money and (2) little technology that goes a long way. Communal living is one of the best enablers for this, as sharing is always cheaper: even if three of four people in an OpenVillage house come out of [extreme poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty), resource sharing should still provide every member with adequate access to modern technology and comfort. We'll see if that can work \u2013 but if it works, we have a solution for poverty that does not even need more production of stuff.\n\n6. **No external employment.** At this level of autarky and sustainability, OpenVillage houses will still need some money. But we can't rely on out-of-house jobs for that as there may be none. OpenVillage houses will only be a working model in areas without job opportunities if they include self-created paid work for the money needs of permanent inhabitants. A second reason is that we in the Edgeryders community tend to dislike work conditions in employment jobs. So instead, we want our own entrepreneurial, well-working, enjoyable revenue options inside OpenVillage houses with good work-life integration.\n\n7. **Not including cheap, ubiquitous non-consumables.** To be sustainable in both financial and ecological terms, the most important items to care about are the consumable items because they cause regular costs and resource use (energy, water, food, Internet access, transportation, body care products) and the expensive non-consumable items (tools, vehicles, furniture). Suitable, ubiquitous non-consumable items are of no concern in the first level of sustainability and autarky of OpenVillage Solutions (\"Level 1\"), as they are usually available as existing personal property or used, at very little cost, from industrial manufacturing. And before we even think about competing with industrial manufacturing, we have a lot of solutions to create that are not available from the industry. In Level 2, we will have DIY, open source versions for some of these products, while still using \"commercial substitutes\" for at least the following:\n\n    * most ordinary manual tools\n    * bicycle components\n    * base hardware for notebook computers and smartphones\n    * electronic components and modules (incl. the Raspberry Pi)\n    * long-distance transportation (ride sharing, trains, airplanes)\n    * clothing raw materials (including re-used fabric pieces)\n    * other raw materials, semi-finished products and components for DIY production (aluminium profiles, bearings etc.)\n\n8. **For Level 1: House is rented.** Actually building our own houses is for a later level of solutions.\n\n9. **For Level 1: House is in a medium to high infrastructure area.** It can be urban or rural, but needs grid infrastructure for water and electricity as fallback solution, parcel service for items not available from own or local production, and medical facilities in reach without the need for a car.\n\n10. **For Level 1: House is in a warm climate.** The climate must not require heating or air conditioning at any time of the year \u2013 adequate clothing must be enough. Where heating or air conditioning is needed, for now traditional \"unsustainable\" solutions have to be used.\n\n11. **For Level 1: Ready for Level 2.** We don't want to overthrow any of the solutions once we move beyond the solutions in this first level of autarky and sustainability, but we want to build on them. So we design with that in mind.\n\n\n## 3. Solutions Level 1 <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\nTo add a solution, edit this wiki and add it. Just make sure it is [required](#chap-2). To work on a solution, please do and just add a link in the list below to your project's home where you are developing it so others can join (could be a topic on this platform, a Github repo, whatever). Mark the solution with the appropriate status using the symbol key below.\n\n**Symbol Key**\n\n* :white_check_mark: solution is ready to use\n* :fast_forward: expedited development underway (\"we need this fast\")\n* :arrow_forward: development underway\n* :pause_button: development had started but stalled\n* :white_circle: development not yet started\n\nIn each section, the important / more basic solutions come earlier in the list. The questions considered is \"how important is it to have the OpenVillage solution compared to off-the-shelf commercial alternatives\", not \"compared to not having a solution at all\".\n\n\n### 3.1. Organization and Communication <a name=\"chap-3-1\"></a>\n\n* :fast_forward: **Network of Houses.** We have a (draft) definition already: \"[Proposal for a network of OpenVillage houses](/t/id/6785)\". Among other things, the network would provide very low monetary rents for permanent residents by cross-funding from the integrated businesses, to which the residents contribute. It would also provide travelers \"from the network\" with guestrooms, without requiring payment in money \u2013 but they may use non-monetary compensation, e.g. via PayCoupons (see below). The network will use an online platform for coordination, which is provided by the edgeryders.eu platform right now (based on the open source software Discourse, source code with adaptations is [here](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse)).\n\n* :fast_forward: **Agile project management system.** Without proper tools for task-based group collaboration, groups of people won't get any complex task or project done, at least not efficiently and enjoyably. For the Edgeryders company, we developed [a suitable process using Dynalist](/t/id/7618), and [we plan](/t/id/7619) to integrate it with Matrix or Discourse, and to eventually replace it with an equivalent open source software. It may also be possible to connect with work by @bilal for this solution.\n\n* :white_check_mark: **Economic exchange system.** For compensated collaboration without needing money, we have [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons) (developed by @daniel and @matthias). See also [here on edgeryders.eu](/t/id/5866) for details.\n\n* :white_circle: **Solutions distro.** A distribution (\"distro\") made from downloadable data packages that contains all OpenVillage solutions in a well-structured, standardized format ready for offline use. There is one package per solution, and packages can refer to other solution packages as dependencies \u2013 so when choosing one for download, you will automatically also get its dependencies. So it is similar to the software package systems of Linux distributions (`.deb` / `.rpm` format etc.). Given failed attempts by others to create a packaging format for open hardware items (such as [SKDB](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/SKDB)), this should be a simple, robust system. It's just about a meta information \"manifest\" file with version, licence and dependency information, a split between \"specs and implementations\" (as utilized in EarthOS), and an adaptable packaging script that can collect the files of a solution project in whatever format they are in and convert them into a standardized format in a standardized folder structure. A package manager application (command line and GUI) then allows to install, uninstall and update packages, all managed in one common folder on ones own computer.\n\n* :fast_forward: **Resource management system.** Especially including a dynamic booking system for rooms, to maximize space utilization over the simpler concept of inhabitants having fixed rooms. Also including a system for shared use of tools, bicycles and other equipment in OpenVillage houses, which should lower the consumption of such products by 90% or more, making their use ecologically much more sustainable.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;For an in-depth look at available open source base software, see [this article](/t/id/6629) by @matthias.\n\n* :white_circle: **House management toolkit.** Tools and manuals to help the founders of OpenVillage Houses make their projects successful. Including, among others: \n\n    * House founder's knowledge base. Containing recommendations for steps and processes when developing the concept of an OpenVillage house and setting it all up.\n    * Tools and practices for self-governance. Including best practices and decision making tools for a house's community, as tested in existing OpenVillage houses and as appropriate for houses of different sizes.\n    * Tools and practices for collaborative development on-site. Such as \"Harmonious Hackathons\", a co-working / community innovation that Edgeryders experimented with during one of the LOTE conferences.\n\n* :white_circle: **Notebook computer setup.** With proper optimization, it should not cost more than 250 EUR used (e.g. ThinkPad X series, T series). By standardizing what models are used in the OpenVillage network, members can help each other out with spare parts and knowledge. Also, having proper information security on the device becomes much simpler with a standardized setup. The setup should also contain recommendations for an ad blocker, which is \"the first line of defense against consumerism\" :stuck_out_tongue: \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;In some OpenVillage houses, there will not be enough money for everyone to have a personal notebook. This can be helped by: everyone would have an own smartphone, and would be able to access a notebook on demand via the house's resource management system. The notebook has user accounts for each house member, and people keep all their data on a USB 3.0 thumb drive that is short enough to stay plugged into the computer while in use, with backups kept encrypted on a local storage server. In addition to the normal personal notebooks, a house would have 1-3 more powerful notebooks for demanding tasks like video production.\n\n* :white_circle: **Smartphone / tablet setup.** Same thing as with notebooks: these can be really inexpensive (<60 EUR used, cheap enough for everyone to get one) when choosing proper, efficient software on them. Most of this software is already available open source from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). And again, having proper information security on the device becomes much simpler with a standardized model and software setup; same goes for spare parts; and for the need to include recommendations for mobile ad blocker software.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed is \"just\" a manual recommending tools and detailing procedures for one or two chosen phone models, similar to the (now outdated) [Freedom Fones Knowledge Base](https://ma.juii.net/blog/freedom-fones-knowledge-base) that @matthias started once in 2013.\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Internet connection toolkit.** Has to contain various tools for Internet uplink (DSL modem, long-range wifi, mobile broadband, Ka-Sat satellite connection) and [ways to minimize the transferred data volume](/t/id/3456). For long-range wifi, use the [Guifi.net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guifi.net) infrastructure. For Ka-Sat, should include a foldable parabolic antenna, and a device for automatically aligning it to the satellite. Ka-Sat is useful in all of Europe, and also for the MENA region, as it covers all of Tunisia and the population centers of Morocco and Egypt.\n\n* :white_circle: **Wifi distribution toolkit.** A box with open-source devices that allow distributing wifi in a larger house and also on conferences of up to 100 people (use case: Edgeryders' LOTE conferences). Proposal: Using the Raspberry Pi 3 as a basis for a wifi router, because we can then define the Raspberry Pi 3 as the standard computing device for OpenVillage House equipment, resulting in a standardized and redundant system. \n\n* :fast_forward: **Digital communications manual.** To provide safe, privacy-protecting online communication under all circumstances. @geminiimatt's \"[Digital Safety and Security Resources](/t/id/7527)\" are just great for this. We just need a full manual-style documentation of that and this solution is boxed! Also we might want to pick up our work on the [Edgeryders Community Crypto Setup](/t/id/4022).\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Mapping toolkit.** A solution for mapping geoinformation related to each OpenVillage House, incl. mapping businesses and other points of interest in the vicinity. So far we use a solution built around uMap and OsmAnd~ (see [OpenVillage House Sidi Kaouki Manual](/t/id/7955), chapter \"3.6. Using our Points of Interest map\"). So far missing is a closer integration between both tools, in the form of a (1) plugin for OsmAnd~ that can sync place markers of a specific category to a specific layer in uMap and (2) a plugin in OsmAnd~ that can download all information from a uMap map into place marker categories, and keep this up to date with the information in the online uMap map.\n\n\n### 3.2. Business <a name=\"chap-3-2\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Financial sustainability toolkit.** A set of well-tested financial planning, monitoring and controlling tools.\n\n* :white_circle: **Guestrooms.** OpenVillage houses have temporarily empty rooms when using dynamic room allocation (or dedicated guestrooms when not), and renting out these overcapacity rooms via platforms for short-term rental like AirBnB is yet another, simple-to-implement revenue model.\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Coffee processing and sale.** Since a public caf\u00e9 is emerging as a favorite component of OpenVillage houses, it is natural to add a coffee processing business for revenue generation. It lowers raw material costs for the caf\u00e9 by starting from parchment coffee rather than green beans. Providing processing services to small roasteries and caf\u00e9s in the same city could be a lucrative business. And especially in coffee-growing countries, it is another business opportunity (and a good way to solidarize with small producers) to buy parchment coffee from small farmers for a relatively high price, process it and roast it for a fixed feel, and to then sell it in the same city or internationally. Without intermediary traders, that is still very profitable.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;For related solutions, see: \"Food marketplace\" for marketing the coffee locally and internationally. This toolkit itself will have to include, among other items:\n\n    * :arrow_forward: a small but fully automated, [open source optical coffee sorter](/t/id/7122) (in initial development)\n    * :arrow_forward: a process to remove parchment shells (@matthias' \"[crazy coffee hack #1](/t/id/6421)\" works but it's crazy)\n    * :white_circle: a small but fully automated, solar-powered roaster\n    * :white_circle: automatic vending machine for coffee (for people to bring their own containers instead of selling it in plastic bags)\n    * :white_circle: open source humidity sensor for coffee beans (also useful for grains etc.)\n\n* :white_circle: **Communal live / work space.** This business model comes in various flavors, but all are about providing a communal space to a community beyond OpenVillage house inhabitants. Variants include, among others: co-working space, public caf\u00e9, communal living room as a [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) for the neighborhood (like 19th-century coffeehouses). Equipment and organization tools for all these are similar, so we cover them by one solution.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; Related solutions (which see): \"Mushroom growing toolkit\" to utilize the spent coffee grounds as growing substrate for mushrooms.\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Direct food sales hub.** A social entrepreneurship business of supporting small-scale farmers in the surrounding area by connecting them directly to customers on international markets. This would be offered as a service for a fixed commission, not in a profit-maximizing manner of purchase and re-sale as intermediate traders do it. Since OpenVillage houses will often be located in rural areas of developing regions and contain people with computer and web marketing skills which are hard to find in these areas, it' s a natural fit.\n\n* :white_circle: **OpenVillage Solution Manufacturing.** A small factory producing OpenVillage Solutions is a natural business model, since OpenVillage houses have to produce these items for themselves anyway. So why not build some more of these open source, frugal, innovative devices, helping out others (incl. other OpenVillage houses) to get them more efficiently. A good example is the [small-scale optical coffee sorter](/t/id/7122).\n\n* :white_circle: **Commercial agriculture.** This is a natural business model, as OpenVillage houses will produce most of their food on their own. So why not grow some for others as well, as the tools are already available. It can be sold, or exchanged for other food, products or services using the PayCoupons solution. Cities always have buyers for food, and commercial urban farming on very little land can be very profitable ([example](http://profitableurbanfarming.com/)).\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Phone and computer remanufacturing.** The idea is for areas where not everyone can afford a smartphone, and not everyone has a notebook who should have one (esp. school kids 14 years and older \u2013 learning to work efficiently with a computer is important for them). Basically, collect used, working or broken, IT hardware from affluent countries where this is very cheap, import this, repair and configure it, and sell these items for little money to those who need it.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;Used but working and still useful Android smartphones are available for <15 EUR in Europe, and people will usually agree to receive a (tax-deductible) donation receipt as compensation instead of money. For such cheap items, shipment to the collection point can also be done cheaply, in uninsured letters. Similar conditions apply for notebook computers (available from 40 EUR) and tablets.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;If somebody wants to work on this business idea, @matthias can provide organizational infrastructure in Germany (an association working in international development that can provide the donation receipts) and technical infrastructure (a software for automating the purchase of desired models of phones, tablets, notebooks etc., which @daniel developed for an attempt at a recommerce startup, called [Mintybox](https://ma.juii.net/blog/recommerce-websites-on-earth)).\n\n\n### 3.3. Accommodation <a name=\"chap-3-3\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Modular construction system.** For furniture and structural parts of devices. A good candidate is [OpenStructures](http://openstructures.net/).\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Furniture.** We need some regular and some innovative furniture that allows high space utilization. For example, a rollable shelf (\"sack barrow style\") for personal belongings, so that even regular inhabitants do not need a fixed room in the house (allowing higher room utilization). Ideally the furniture will be a modular system, using abundant and sustainable raw materials.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;As for progress, there is the [BitCut](/t/id/6999) open source furniture platform by @m_tantawy. Also @matthias has done [some initial experiments](/t/id/4116).\n\n* :white_circle: **Recirculating shower add-on.** Current methods of showering are just wasteful and thus create unnecessary dependencies. There are product designs for recirculating showers to fix this, but we need an open source one that can also be added to and removed from a shower in any urban flat.\n\n* :white_circle: **Dishwashing system.** Can be manual, but has to be efficient.\n\n* :white_circle: **Washing machine.** Has to be energy saving (heavily insulated drum, heating water with solar power or a gas burner but never grid electricity, automatic start / stop planning to run fully on grid electricity). Being water-saving is not important, as the waste water is filtered and used in the garden.\n\n* :white_circle: **Separating dry toilet.** Flush toilet are a waste of nearly everything (freshwater, pipes, water cleaning capacity etc.). Instead, a separating dry toilet produces urine (which is sterile and can be used as nitrogen fertilizer mixed 1:7 with water) and dry feces, which are of great use in the garden because one can simply fill them into a 1 m\u00b3 hole, put 50 cm humus on top and plant a tree. This is  safe if it is \u226530 m away from drinking water sources. For added safety, one can heat the feces to >65 \u00b0C before, as that kills the relevant germs of waterborne diseases.\n\n* :white_circle: **House beautification toolkit.** The first OpenVillage houses will often have meanwhile contracts in \"rough\" buildings, because that is cheap. So we need a best practices manual and perhaps some equipment for making such spaces nice and livable with very little money and time. Most or all of the improvements should be possible to move to the next space, because investments in meanwhile property does not pay off.\n\n* :white_circle: **Traveler accommodation kits.** Since OpenVillage houses often accommodate travelers from the OpenVillage network, and digital nomads, it makes sense to have \"kits\"  so guests know they will get a certain set of equipment during their stay at an OpenVillage house. This makes travel cheaper (save the costs of checked-in baggage when flying with budget airlines like RyanAir) and more comfortable (less to carry, no issues getting a small pocket knife in cabin luggage through security \u2013 which is officially allowed but difficult). The kit would contain, among other items: bedsheets (or sleeping bag with inlet), towel, shower gel, multi-tool, clothing (to be chosen from a large cabinet), rollable personal equipment shelf (developed in another solution).\n\n\n### 3.4. Energy <a name=\"chap-3-4\"></a>\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Off-grid energy system.** Using 24 V DC electricity. Includes battery chargers, energy monitoring, smart use of excess energy, conversion to the most common electrical power supplies (DC-DC converters with various connector tips for notebooks, USB etc.) and essential consumers for this type of electricity (lighting). Storage and generation are in separate solutions.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;This solution must also be applicable for urban flats: there, you should be able to put a few photovoltaics panels on your balcony and behind windows, some batteries into your living room, and cancel your contract with the electricity provider. The energy would be sufficient for LED lighting and IT devices, while you'd cook with biogas (see below).\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal for the charging hardware is [Free Charge Controller v4.04](http://www.freechargecontroller.org/#Version_4.04), plus developing variants for higher currents and for 24 V batteries. A good base project for the monitoring part is [OpenEnergyMonitor](http://www.openenergymonitor.org/), which has been [used by Edgeryders before](/tags/project-open-energy-monitor). For the electrical connectors, a well-working proposal is to use SpeakON connectors (see section 4 in [this article](https://ma.juii.net/blog/not-so-normal-living) by @matthias \u2013 proper documentation to follow).\n\n* :white_circle: **Indoor biogas digester.** It utilizes carbohydrate-rich kitchen scraps such as from fruits. A small plant is enough, as it is only required for cooking, not for heating etc.. Has to include a small intermediate storage for one day of use, either in a kind of large plastic bag or in an open-bottom container floating on water. Hydrogen from an electrolyser can also be mixed into the stored biogas, as produced from excess photovoltaics energy. Should be an open source biodigester that is applicable for urban areas as well \u2013 which is not easy, as indoor storage of methane hass to be safe, and also fumes have to be avoided.\n\n* :white_circle: **Indoor bio-ethanol plant.** This would consume all kinds of high-carbohydrate waste, and produce ethanol for use as fuel, disinfection and cleaning agent. Distillation would be done with excess thermal solar power, and for that raw materials would be stored fermented but n-distilled or even frozen until the next summer if necessary. Proposed to have in addition to the biodigester as the fuel can be stored better and allows other uses (heated clothing, electricity generator etc.). Raw materials can come from all kinds of fruit scraps in the kitchen, from rotten fruits that can be collected from markets or from non-harvested trees, and from commercially produced fruit waste.\n\n* :white_circle: **Lithium-ion battery storage.** Though not easy to handle safely, this would be the standard as it is needed for notebooks and electrical bicycles / quadrocycles / velomobiles anyway.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, notebook and powertool batteries contain a number of so-called 18650 LiIon cells, of which usually quite some are still usable even though the pack has died. They can be combined into own, new batteries which are effectively available without any monetary investment. Even cells in undervoltage condition (<3 V) can be relatively safely charged and re-used _if you know how_. What we need here are tools and instructions for building battery packs and working with LiIon batteries, including battery chargers, battery testers, an open source spot welder, 3D printed cell holders, and self-made protection circuits.\n\n* :white_circle: **Solar pavilion.** A small 3.5\u00d73.5 m (or larger) hut with open walls but the option to close them with fabric curtains like a tent, providing additional space for temporary guests. The roof is made from lightweight, semi-flexible solar panels. The construction can be made from bamboo and / or aluminium, with 3D printed connectors, and the roof would have the right inclination as needed for solar panels. Can be used on rooftop terraces and in the garden. Much better than permanently installed panels on roofs, as OpenVillage houses will be in rented property in the beginning so the solar panels have to be kept mobile. The whole solar pavilion should fit into some euroboxes for transport and storage.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, a simple pavilion is better than a solar tracker: it has no moving parts that could break, no complex electronics, a simpler mechanical construction, and it has become difficult to build an economically profitable solar tracker anyway. However, especially where little space is available, the pavilions can easily be one-axis or two-axis solar trackers. For that, they would have a circular footprint, resting on 6 pillars, and the whole roof would be able to rotate on a large ring, and to tilt at a pivot point that touches the ring. This construction has no counterweights for the panels (changing the math of when it's worthwhile to tilt it), but comes as a simple, sturdy construction when compared to the typical solar trackers with a central pillar. Also with a rotating roof, there is no danger of interfering with people.\n\n\n### 3.5. Water <a name=\"chap-3-5\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Rainwater harvester.** Rain is free, so why flush the toilet with potable water? Or shower with potable water? There would be two variants of the rainwater harvester. The first variant has to work for collecting from the roof of rented urban houses, where the challenge is that no permanent infrastructure can be installed. For example, a hose can be laid into the roof gutter, with a pump sucking in the rainwater. The second variant would be for flat outdoor spaces and would be quick-deployable over the plants in the garden. This way, the plants do not get the rainwater directly, but it is purified into potable water (as much as needed), used, and fed to the plants as purified wastewater. This works around the more difficult task of having to clean wastewater into potable water.\n\n* :white_circle: **Wastewater cleaning system.** Probably, two types of wastewater would be collected: water from showers, handwashing, the kitchen etc. that is only polluted with biodegradable detergents, organic materials and germs, and water polluted with oils and chemicals. The first type can be cleaned with slow sand filters and (old) ceramic filters to be safe for plants. The second type would be evaporated drop by drop on a small device powered by excess photovoltaics energy.\n\n* :white_circle: **Water heater.** Hot water is only needed for showering, washing clothing and cleaning other items. The needs are known at least a bit in advance, and one should enter a need (amount, temperature, time to be ready) into the system as soon as one knows the need. This allows the water heater to select the most suitable, most energy saving way to fulfill that need. It can then automatically combine several means, such as thermal solar collectors, biogas / hydrogen burner, bio-ethanol burner (as backup) and electrical flow-through heating from excess photovoltaics energy.\n\n* :white_circle: **Water purifier.** For producing potable water from ground water and rainwater. Can be done with DIY produced ceramic filters (and using 2-3 of them in a row for added safety).\n\n\n### 3.6. Food <a name=\"chap-3-6\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Food foraging and gleaning toolkit.** Proposal: Contribute to the development, database and community of [mundraub.org](http://www.mundraub.org/). Especially, do food source mapping exercises in OpenStreetMap style.\n\n* :white_circle: **Food preservation tools.** Drying, canning etc., perhaps [vacuum drying](/t/id/3575). Also useful before growing own food, to preserve oversupply food and wasted food from markets etc.. The dryer should be solar-powered \u2013 using vacuum tube type thermal solar collectors, one can produce enough warm air even on cloudy days.\n\n* :white_circle: **Composter.** Of course, because humus is the best natural fertilizer. The compost also takes the residue coming out of the biogas plant and kitchen scraps not suitable for the biogas plant. Composts produce heat, and this heat should be captured for room heating by placing the compost indoors, in a gas-tight space of course.\n\n* :white_circle: **Small gardening toolkit.** Allowing raised-bed container gardening on rooftops and in any other small space.\n\n* :white_circle: **Mushroom growing toolkit.** For areas with very limited space with sunlight to grow plants (such as rented urban houses), mushroom growing is great because mushrooms need no light. We want a full-lifecycle semi-industrial toolkit here that can provide enough mushrooms for everyone in the house (say, 100 - 200 g per person per day).\n\n* :white_circle: **Extended gardening toolkit.** Focusing on innovative tools for efficiency in larger-scale gardening. Can include attachments for the four-wheeled cargocycles. No plough etc. is needed, because of course it will all be about no-till lazy permaculture gardening and edible landscapes.\n\n* :white_circle: **Exchange system for recovered food.** The challenge is here to map supply and demand _fast_ and in a local area. Proposal: Contributing to the development of the [FoodSharing](http://foodsharing.de/) software and community.\n\n\n### 3.7. Healthcare, Personal Care <a name=\"chap-3-7\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Body care and hygiene products.** Self-made soap, toothpaste etc..\n\n* :white_circle: **Indoor air filter.** Quite essential for example when living in Kathmandu in the dry season. Instead of a commercial \u2265600 USD indoor air filter, a DIY one made from a HEPA filter and a fan [achieves comparable results](https://qz.com/112173). Instead of a HEPA filter, a simple kitchen furnace filter will also [do the job](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Replacement-AIR-Filters/), and further research may find ways to create DIY filtering materials. Note that a HEPA filter will remove 90% of PM 0.3 particles while a high-end commercial filter will remove close to 100% ([see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU)) \u2013 but that difference is of little concern as the indoor air will be filtered again and again, each time removing 90% of the remaining particles. Such \"DIY filters\" are also on sale in India (see [here](https://smartairfilters.com/in/en/product/original-diy-air-purifier/) and [here](https://smartairfilters.com/in/en/product/cannon-diy-air-purifier-white/), including more details about effectiveness and lifetime).\n\n* :white_circle: **Wearable air filter.** It might be possible to create a solution based on HEPA filter material, or even kitchen furnace filter material. To avoid wearing a mask, it may be sufficient to direct a small jet of air to the nose.\n\n* :white_circle: **Contraception.** Population reduction to sustainable levels is essential for long-term ecosystem health of the planet. To have a birth control method that is applicable to everyone worldwide, independent of budget, by first approximation an open source implementation of the [Natural Cycles software](https://www.naturalcycles.com/en) would do the job very well.\n\n* :white_circle: **Human health manual.** The one manual nobody has written yet, and the reason why people claim and believe a lot of fiction in popular discourse about health issues. This manual should contain all reasonable do-it-yourself contributions to good health, ordered by priority and backed by scientific data, and with hints when an external service is needed from medical personnel.\n\n* :white_circle: **Health insurance.** For starters, there is a creative analysis by @matthias for how to [get cheap health insurance as a self-employed in Germany](http://ma.juii.net/blog/health-insurance-for-self-employed-germans).\n\n\n### 3.8. Tools  <a name=\"chap-3-8\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Workshop assembly instructions.** To work on the other solutions listed here inside an OpenVillage house, a light duty workshop / fab lab for metal, wood, plastics, electronics and bicycles is required (and sufficient). In this level, we're not building many tools in DIY and open source fashion, but there has to be a manual how to find good tools for good prices, and which tools are recommendable. That's what this solution is about.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;An incomplete list of tools to include is: basic mechanics hand tools, MIG welder, nuts and bolts, metal / wood / plastic / electronics parts. Plus the tools mentioned below in other solutions.\n\n* :white_circle: **Bicycle toolkit.** Industrially produced bicycles are ubiquitous so we just use them in Level 1, but we need some required specialized tools to maintain and repair them.\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Powertools.** All powertools should work on the 24 V DC grid, in preparation for a completely off-grid home. For that, modifying 28 V DC battery powertools by exchanging the battery with a (removable) cable connection works nicely. While full documentation is still missing, for initial instructions see section 4 in @matthias' [article](https://ma.juii.net/blog/not-so-normal-living). The initial set of powertools modified that way would include: good soldering station, power drill, angle grinder, jigsaw, circular hand saw, tablesaw, router, sabersaw.\n\n* :arrow_forward: **FDM 3D printer.** All ready except for documenting this solution: just buy a commercial kit of an open source 3D printer, preferably from [Lulzbot](https://www.lulzbot.com/store/printers).\n\n* :white_circle: **Filament maker.** For recycling previous prints of the 3D printer (and Lego bricks \u2026) into filament for new prints.\n\n* :white_check_mark: **Plastic recycling machines.** This toolset is already fully developed and documented, see the [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/en/) machines.\n\n\n### 3.9. Transportation <a name=\"chap-3-9\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Equipment mobility system.** Based on euroboxes and EPAL pallets.\n\n* :white_circle: **Open-source e-bike conversion kit.** Being able to convert any of the ubiquitous normal bikes to an e-bike with an open-source, DIY produced kit would give a big boost to low-cost personal mobility. One could for example explore using defunct battery powered drills for the electric motor.\n\n* :white_circle: **Cargo bicycles.** These should have (optional or detachable) electric drive as support. A good design seems to be an electric drive tandem that can be converted to a long cargo bicycle similar to the one by [Portal Bikes](http://www.portalbikes.org/). That seems to be the ultimately flexible solution: a single-lane vehicle that can go everywhere a bicycle can, and can be used to transport goods _and_ to pick up people.\n\n* :white_circle: **Open-source electric velomobile.** The ultimate in personal low-cost mobility, but also quite a complex project.\n\n* :white_circle: **Electric walk-behind tractor.** A small (3-6 kW) electrical gardening tractor with a standard attachment for gardening tools. Also to convert into a load-transporting vehicle by adding a trailer: slow but suitable for the heaviest loads to transport around here. Also as a big, mobile battery pack for heavy use of the 24 V power tools on the go (wood cutting etc.). Can even be made into an autonomous gardening tractor later.\n\n\n### 3.10. Restoration <a name=\"chap-3-10\"></a>\n\nIn solutions level 1, the focus is to achieve the overall 90% reduction in impact by decreasing consumption. Restoration activity will have its part in this 90% reduction (by undoing damage, so 90% is a net effect), but it's always better to not do the damage than to do it and repair it. So restoration is not a focus area here, unlike in the higher solution levels.\n\n* :white_circle: **Restoration manual.** Ecosystem restoration projects and their impacts are very diverse and it is difficult to know the best for the start. So there should be this manual, detailing DIY ecosystem restoration in a step-by-step plan, with the equipment of OpenVillage Solutions Level 1 assumed as the starting point. Instructions would of course differ by the local situation and ecosystem. There would be a detailed analysis of when it's better to go for moonshot projects (risky attempts to start large-scale restoration, in collaboration with funders and governmens) and when for smaller-scale DIY solutions.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;Example activities include anything from wildlife habitats for insects, birds etc. around the house and food garden, helping neighbors switch to sustainable energy, cleaning up waste from the environment, tree planting, swales for groundwater infiltration, soil buildup, and seacrete production on a massive scale to undo ocean acidification.\n\n\n## 4. Solutions Level 2 <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\nThe following is a very unfinished list of ideas for equipment needed for the second level of autarky and sustainability in OpenVillage Houses: for going from 90% to 99% reduction in net resource consumption.\n\n\n### 4.1. Energy <a name=\"chap-4-1\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **Heated clothing.** The lowest-cost way of keeping yourself warm. Could be an open source variant of [fluid-heated clothing](http://www.thermoflash.com/), with thermal and pump control by an open source microcontroller and as an indoor-usable heat source using a (1) a \"permanent candle\" that runs on molten wax or (2) an ethanol burner or (3) a methane burner, fueled from the biodigester. Even better, the heat output of the biochar <abbr title=\"combined heat and power\">CHP</abbr> pellet stove can be used, but will require connecting a hose to an outlet.\n\n* :white_circle: **Indoor insulation.** Can be made by recycling woolen clothing, or expanded polystyrene trash. The idea is to have a modular system with which any room can be retrofitted with extreme (50 cm) insulation _on the inside_, so not needing any landlord's permission. So one will have one or a few very-cost-efficiently heated rooms in a building, and use the other unheated ones either with the heated clothing (for example in workshops), or only shortly (for example storage rooms).\n\n* :white_circle: **Trash paper and trash wood pelletizer.** Allows to create fuel from any paper trash, and any kind of wood trash (incl. ubiquitous small twigs etc.). Pellets are stored and in the heating season go into the biochar <abbr title=\"combined heat and power\">CHP</abbr> pellet stove (see below).\n\n* :arrow_forward: **Biochar <abbr title=\"combined heat and power\">CHP</abbr> pellet stove.** Assuming the targeted 90% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions was achieved in OpenVillage Solutions Level 1, we are still left with per-capita CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions of 6.9 t/year * 0.1 = 690 kg/year ([based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions) on EU emissions in 2015). In this second level, the task is to again reduce that by 90% (or more), going towards zero net effects on the environment.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty is that these remaining emissions are mostly embodied in essential industrial items we use. So to offset them, the idea here is to produce [biochar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar) for carbon sequestration. Biochar is charcoal used as a long-term stable, beneficial soil amendment, and would be mixed it with our compost into high-quality soil. Roughly, offsetting the remaining 690 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions means producing 230 kg of carbon per person. At [max. 9% black carbon (by mass) in terra preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta#Wood_charcoal), this means a yield of ca. 2550 kg terra preta soil per person. At 600 - 700 kg/m<sup>3</sup> compost density, that means around 4 m<sup>3</sup> of terra preta soil production per person and year to offset the remaining CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The raw material for biochar can be any kind of dry biomass; we would use deadwood collected from forests as all our organic trash is more suitable for composting, and we need a lot of compost as well.\n  &nbsp; To utilize the biomass energy as fully as possible, the biochar stove is here combined with a <abbr title=\"combined heat and power\">CHP</abbr> power plant, where heat is used for space heating and the woodgas from charcoal production is used to drive an internal combustion engine and with that, a generator. This provides heat when it's needed (in winter) and electricity when it can't be readily supplied by photovoltaics (in winter) from a long-term storable energy carrier (dried biomass) with positive side effects (carbon storage, soil production). So it's an all-around winning solution.\n  &nbsp; See @darren's [biochar rocket stove](/tags/project-biochar-rocket-stove) project for work on the stove. For a commercial biomass <abbr title=\"combined heat and power\">CHP</abbr> plant product (with open source origins), see the [APL Power Pallet PP20](http://www.allpowerlabs.com/carbon). For an autarkic commune house, a much smaller plant is needed though. Instead of a 15 kW power pallet, a 625 W unit at 16 hours runtime per day (which is the time where space heating is needed) can provide 10 kWh electrical energy. That is enough for the maximum of 20 inhabitants in an OpenVillage house at a consumption of 500 Wh / (person*day), which is a low but realistic estimate based on typical usage in an off-grid camping vehicle.\n\n* :white_circle: **DIY lead-acid batteries.** In this level of autarky, we can't simply use LiIon batteries everywhere as the cells cannot be DIY produced easily. Lead-acid cells can, however. It requires some research and expertise, but is definitely doable and the lowest-cost DIY way to acquire electricity storage capacity for off-grid photovoltaics plants. Techniques will include cell production incl. plate priming, but also ways to repair degraded lead-acid batteries (short-circuit fixing with welders, de-sulphatation with special chargers, de-sulphatation with EDTA, and exchanging individual cell contents as a last-ditch measure).\n\n* :white_circle: **Photovoltaics modules.** This is about creating modules from cells, which we still have to get from industrial production (broken modules, overstock supplies etc.). In OVS Level 1, building own modules makes no sense as used modules are available for cheap (30% of the price of new ones, just needing energy controllers that can cope with many different models and types of modules to uilize these).\n\n* :white_circle: **Temporary photovoltaics panels for urban roofs.** Insolated surface is scarce in cities, and tenants usually can't install permanent infrastructure. So this idea is to have a roll of photovoltaics panels that automatically rolls itself on a roof (from a roof window) whenever the weather is not dangerous for the panels (not windy, no hail, no snow).\n\n* :white_circle: **Tracked mirrors for boosting photovoltaics panels.** Maybe one only has a small balcony for a photovoltaics panel and it only gets 2 hours of sun per day, but also has friendly neighbors who agree to host self-contained tracked mirror arrays on their balcony, window shutters or roof. They will reflect sunlight to the photovoltaics array and boost its output (it may need cooling though). The same can be done in the countryside to create photovoltaics energy in more DIY fashion (less silicon, lower monetary costs).\n\n* :white_circle: **LED lighting.** Open source designs for some super-efficient LED lighting setups, both for 240 V AC and 12-24 V DC (for off-grid setups). There are many unexplored ideas how to have both comfortable and efficient lighting, incl. room lighting that tracks people in the room, headlights that are recharged in seconds with ultracaps, and white furniture coloring (plus reflector use) to increase light utilization.\n\n\n### 4.2. Other <a name=\"chap-4-2\"></a>\n\n* :white_circle: **CNC lathe.** A fully DIY construction will struggle to be strong enough for lathing steel and stainless steel, but grinding stones and grinding disks can be used for these materials instead. It will take long, but a CNC machine can just work on its own so it does not matter.\n\n* :white_circle: **CNC mill.** For working with steel, the same remark as for the CNC lathe applies: it can work when using innovative grinding toolheads rather than cutters.\n\n* :white_circle: **Camper trailer accommodation.** Remanufacturing used camper trailers would be the lowest-cost way to provide accomodation options that do not need rent. Used camper trailers in bad but usable condition are available for 500 EUR or less. After refurbishing and retrofitting them with photovoltaics etc., they could be available for 5000 EUR in barter value.\n\n* :white_circle: **Automated farming toolkit.** Including automated equipment for growing herbs and vegetables on urban rooftops, in small backyard and frontyard gardens, on walls (\"vertical farming\") and by guerrilla gardening unused spots.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;A great base technology is [FarmBot](https://farmbot.io/yield/), of which the small 4 m\u00b2 version can supposedly grow all the vegetables one person needs, while 110 - 205 m\u00b2/person are needed to cover all the calorie needs for a person by growing vegetables with Farmbot ([see](https://farmbot.io/yield/)). Assuming that 1/3 of the calories would come from nuts, fruits and vegetables each, 36 - 68 m\u00b2 per person of Farmbot area would be needed to grow the required vegetables, the rest being distributed fruit trees and nut bushes. A specialized version would be needed for vertical farming on walls. A Farmbot farming system is also really interesting for terraced farming in Nepal \u2013 on all the land that is not farmed anymore right now because people are moving to the cities and abroad.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;For commercial farming, an autonomous electric vehicle would be much cheaper than placing a cartesian robot on each garden bed. It would need precision tracks left and right, perhaps with a type of optical encoders, to navigate in each garden bed.\n\n* :white_circle: **Flow Hive beekeeping toolkit.** Another way for landless food production. May include guerrilla gardening of flowers around the neighborhood \u2026 lots of flowers, one in every unused square centimeter :bouquet: :sunglasses:\n\n* :white_circle: **Ordinary bicycles.** In Level 2, we actually produce full bicycles (while still using industrially manufactured components where they are too difficult to make).\n\n* :white_circle: **Testing equipment for recovered food.** Open source knowledge and tools to keep up food safety when eating \"marginally eatable\" food items.\n\n* :white_circle: **Biogas kitchen stove.** Fueled from the indoor biogas digester, which see. In Level 1, a usual commercial LPG kitchen stove can be used.\n\n\n## 5.

It brought together local people working on open care solutions. Nearing the end of the session, we discussed our reflections and it came to the issue of collaborating. \n\nI brought up the question \u201cconnecting and collaborating takes substantial time, often too much for this type of projects. So should projects themselves make this risky investment, or is there an external initiative that takes the lead to invest time and resources in it?\u201d.\n\nIt was clear to me then that it is a matter of investing upfront, before there\u2019s any tangible outcomes that propel each individual project forward. When the collaboration is rolling, when the incentives are clear, it should be pretty self-sustaining. So the question can be reframed as: who makes the upfront investment?\n\nLast week, the OpenVillage Festival gave us an immersive and powerful experience. Exchanging with such a diverse group of people from all walks of life, thinking deeply, making concrete plans and having fun in a genuine setting. It was grand, quoting Anthony.\n\nOn the day after the festival, some of us came together to assess how we could continue the work we\u2019ve been doing. I have been knee deep in trying to make my own projects work, being in survival mode the last months. I had lost track of the bigger picture that was in front of me.\n\nWe have all contributed to the journey to OpenVillage that started months ago: the community members, the OpenCare project and the Fellows. But Edgeryders has contributed by far the most and saw the need to get people moving in the same direction. I can\u2019t imagine many would disagree with the value they have gotten out of it so far. Only now, while synthesizing notes several days later, it dawns on me. Everything that has been done, where Edgeryders took a leading role, has been the investment. Will we put to use what has been built?\n\nDuring the first hours of the Festival, we sat down in groups of three to talk to each other. In their stories, both of my conversation partners posed the question if Edgeryders would be better at walking the talk. Better than who? The system? Our own projects? However it may be, there were clear expectations of the Festival, of Edgeryders.\n\nOn the evening of day 2, I sat down again with one of my earlier conversation partners. I asked how his thinking had evolved since the start. He said that he realised the situation was more nuanced than that. \u201cI\u2019ve come to realise we are all Edgeryders, we should step up.\u201d\n\nI think that is the essence of where we are at. My own projects have evolved, not in small part thanks to Edgeryders and the Fellowship. We have the capacity for others to benefit from what we have built, with concrete actions. We can give, help others to grow like we did and will step up. \n\nAs OpenVillage unfolds, I\u2019m looking out how to contribute and hope to see you there!", "created_at": "2017-10-27 15:41:01.608764", "updated_at": "2017-10-27 15:41:01.608764", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 272.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1935, 5, 4, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38814, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7578, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-27 13:09:24.386035", "updated_at": "2017-10-27 13:09:24.386035", "deleted_at": "2017-10-27 23:42:45.205274", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38790, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7579, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-27 03:14:46.918146", "updated_at": "2017-10-27 03:14:46.918146", "deleted_at": "2017-10-27 23:42:11.225119", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38992, "user_id": 200, "topic_id": 7586, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I was one of @winnieponcelet's  little group posing [quote=\"winnieponcelet, post:1, topic:7586\"]\nthe question if Edgeryders would be better at walking the talk\n[/quote]\nBut I didn't get the chance to follow up, like our third member, so maybe I might do that here?\n\nFor me, the key walk that it is far easier to talk about than walk, is the walk of caring for each other in a way that is mutual, supportive, non-invasive, and oriented towards mutual growth. I'm absolutely with @alberto's response, as well, noting that in such a vast and challenging space, we are all lost, just some are more hopelessly lost than others. Alberto invites us to join together in humility on this one. I accept wholeheartedly! Our awe when we see others stepping up keeps us humble, but also draws us in, when we feel that our values are genuinely similar.\n\nAs I've said in reply to @nadia's contribution as well, I'm working on writing something about ways of taking those first steps of care, particularly in the situation where we come together not knowing each other in advance. And I hope there are ideas that can help us both in the \"Festival\" context and also with our online community. Surely, it is vital to help people both to engage with each other and get to know each other well... It's not a mechanical process, of course, but I do believe we can encourage it more or less effectively. Again, no simple formulae. One size does not fit all. But I think there are enough common points that are emerging from many people to have some good guesses.\n\nSo ... stepping up &mdash; absolutely! It's not other people's responsibility, it's ours as and when we feel that calling in us. But also ... but also ... we can support each other to step up, and that, I think, is where the culture of the community (or the culture set in a gathering) can make a lot of difference. Many of us (I definitely include myself) need some kind of support to step up. And I'm pretty sure that there are some people I could offer support to for them to be able to step up.

In Sweden the home is a closed off thing. One of its key attributes is serving as a fort and highly controlled environment entry to which has to be negotiated in advance and only for specific people, especially around meals. My parents home served as a social hangout place with people dropping by all the time at any time of the day, often without pre-warning, at most a call asking if we were in. Midnight, noon....didn't matter, when people showed up you would welcome them with tea and cookies or food if it was mealtime. \n\nI believe that experimenting with cultural concepts of \"home\" as a place and set of interactions that take place in it is central towards understanding and reshaping that relationships between selves.

Other low cost very easy solutions is simply using buckets, I have seen this in a mosque in Brussels ( but I believe it was implemented only because of plumping due to different hot water and cold water taps ) ....this is also affecting people behavior so it needs different approaches in deferent cultures as I think the bucket technique wont work in Egypt unless there is a necessity. \n\nWater saving tapes, [Foot tapes](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Foot-Taps-to-Conserve-Water), probably are being used, but this is not a widely adopted solution, still there could be some more development to be done, thinking about the space as a whole, and reusing the water itself.  ( @monarezk someone from Ain El bei'a developed some sort of a solution ? I can't find it now, can you please verify this ? )  \n\nin short the intention is to develop and collect different cheap open source solutions to be implemented, tested, in different places.  ( some sort of a kit how to transform the wudu' space ) \n\nin order to get there, I believe we need to crowdsource many solutions, I am proposing  to coordinate a design process, engage universities to have this as a design project for their students, plus hackathons or design workshops, hopefully during the residency period in Morocco.  I can also continue working on some old ideas. \n\nIf the process ended up with usable cheap products, it could be adopted easily in many countries, if the solution fits the culture, as for Egypt for example there are always money dedicated to renovate the mosques or bring carpets, maintaining the space ( this could be easily us to get to ed to renovate the plumping and change the wudu' space, if people saw the value in this ) - I think this would be the case in other countries as well. \n\nEnd product optimal consumption rate should be equal or below 1.3 Liter ( check this [expensive machine](http://www.aace.com.my/ws_spec.htm) ) \n\nso any ideas, hints, advices on this ?\n\n---\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/190d3e8953e9ee9b9c385bd4dd384285abf204f9.png\"

Great that you have seen the precious plastic project being implemented in Romania. I am not based in Egypt, but I have a passion for design (amongst many others) and love practical, sustainable solutions like the one developed by Dave Hakkens. Therefore, when I was browsing through the various threads and projects here on Edgeryders, my eye fell on this project. Having learned of Dave Hakkens' Precious Plastic recently, I simply thought that it could be an interesting starting point for Bitcut. Not only because all blue prints for the machinery are open source, but also there they could benefit from the already existing community.

Looking at it I realise how tight we are: Alberto, Noemi, Matthias, John and I. How strong and impenetrable we must seem to others. The irony being that we would love more people to share the benefits and struggles of going on this journey together. This post is a formalisation of our plans to make it easier for others to join us in building the future of Edgeryders.\n\nThe  Edgeryders organisation is a not for profit company that develops the community, technology, events and projects like [OpenCare](https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare) or [OpenVillage](http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu). The five directors (and currently the only company members) handle the day to day operations that bring in the money and keep it all running smoothly. Technical development and maintenance, community management, research, business development, projects delivery etc. The board accepts new members after a unanimous decision by the existing ones. Members are lifelong stewards of edgeryders - they do not interfere in day to day operations and only step in in extreme cases (e.g if directors do something illegal, unethical or in any other way put community or company in jeopardy).\n\nOver the years the five members have built deep trust and respect as well as shared understanding of values which are not so obvious to others outside the team. Our sensitivity to each person's idiosyncracies. Designing projects around one another's aspirations, skillsets and needs. Giving each other freedom to go off, try new things, experiment because we trust that it is in service of the collective.\n\nNow that the core is solid, it\u2019s time to roll out a process by which people can formally join the Edgeryders organisation and take leadership positions in it as directors. We have these requirements:\n\n* It has to put no additional financial burden on the organisation. As is the case for the current directors, newcomers have no salary or budget to work with, other than what they bring in themselves through funding or revenue from different activities. \n\n* It has to be compatible with our ethics and philosophy of self-directed work, and attitude towards management of resources. The Edgeryders company is a [Fraternitas Mercatorum](http://bit.ly/2zcMinn) with a social mission, not a democracy or cooperative.\n\n* It has to act as an onboarding mechanism to establish interpersonal alignment, understanding and trust. We are on an open-ended journey into the future together in which we are getting to know, cherish and take care of one another. John described what this means in practice during the festival ([notes available here](http://bit.ly/2yTGbS0)).\n\n* It has to work for a diverse range of people who are in different physical, psychosocial and professional places in their lives. No cookie-cutter formulas. We figure something out that works for both parties, put it down in writing and honour the agreement. Simple.\n\n**So what does this mean? How can you join the Edgeryders board of directors?** \n\n1. **Inform yourself** about the [community](http://bit.ly/2zeTiAi) and [company](http://bit.ly/2ybqetg), [what we care about](http://bit.ly/2zWcy2E), [community guidelines](http://bit.ly/2xvBnRj), [terms of use and privacy policy](https://edgeryders.eu/t/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy/44), [community manager\u2019s manual](http://bit.ly/2yTjUnz), as well as our [data methodology](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-and-data-driven/37).\n\n2. **Think about which areas of work make sense for you**: Online Community Management, Business Development, Project Management, Local Outreach & Engagement, Storytelling & Culture, Personal development & Training, House Management, Event Production. Think about what level of responsibility and commitment of time you would like to take on.\n\n3. **Get in touch** with us for a chat to figure out a role that fits nicely with your interests and constraints. We will also agree on a personalised path to becoming part of the company which works for you.

Could result in a nice open source hardware business model for your initiative :slight_smile: \n\nNamely, there's [regaltischlerei.de](https://www.regaltischlerei.de/), a German website where customers can order custom-made furniture in sizes they want it in. For their online furniture configurator I developed the function to show the piece of furniture in 3D in the browser. To try it: when configuring your piece of furniture on their website, you will get to a point where you see a 3D preview of the item, using the sizes, materials and colors you entered. Click & drag in that preview with the mouse pointer, and you can watch it from all angles.\n\nNow for open source furniture like you want to build, a configurator software makes even more sense. Since the design is open source anyway, you can offer auto-generated CAD files for download to the customer, using the parameters the customer entered. Some will go and build the piece of furniture themselves, but others will order it to be custom-made by your company. The feature will make you well-known as \"the company that hands out free plans for your customized furniture\", and the publicity from that will bring in enough paying customers as well.\n\nJust sayin'. Because I know making open source sustainable is hard, but I support it fully. (If you want to know more about the browser 3D tech, let me know.

She tweets and [blogs](https://abebabirhane.wordpress.com/) about embodied cognition and the enactive approach to cognitive science, which is how I came across her work, when Marco shared a link to [her post](https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons) on Aeon. Abeba\u2019s interest in a more relational understanding of personhood and dialogical approaches informed by the likes of Bakhtin, could bring a useful perspective to understanding the enabling conditions for community-led Opencare. While her work is not specific to the field of care, there are clear connections between the field of her research and how we think about a person and the challenges around health that OpenCare is wrestling with. The extent to which our Cartesian mindset goes unquestioned can be seen in the way which our health and social care systems have developed and our responses to solving the big challenges in public health that have faced society. \n\nAbeba interests lie in the problematic conceptions of selfhood that arise from the influence of Descartes on psychology, the modern mind and ways of understanding our place in the world. She draws on Ubuntu and African philosophy for richer conceptions of the self and on the work of Bakhtin. Bakhtin\u2019s study of philosophy led him to develop the concept of dialogism - a concept that went on to influence fields beyond language and communication. European social psychologists have applied Bakhtin's work to the study of human social experience, preferring it as a more dynamic alternative to Cartesian dualism. Abeba\u2019s research interests lie in the emerging fields of embodied and enactive cognition, which are similarly finding greater potential in dialogic models of the self. She is researching the ways in which our personhood is \"always on the move, is relational and communal\u201d. Sharing these insights may contribute to a sense of what a relational health and social care system might look like. Where patients are no longer treated as self-contained units in need of some form or intervention within conduit models of service delivery and greater health is generated through greater interconnection with others, with community and society.  \n\nI\u2019m hoping Abeba will post some thoughts and that conversations will develop that will provide insights as to the assumptions our current care systems are founded on - conversations that may continue as part of the open sessions at the Open Village in October.

We were stopped after only a minute and required to go through the admin stuff first -- budget consumption, man-month and money, ..., explain why we didn't meet the planned quantities, show the deliverable timetable, etc. I suspect the reviewers will once again want to start with these admin issues.\n\nMy feeling is they adopt a box-checking perspective on their mission as reviewers. This is a pity, I agree, but do we have a choice but to adapt to them?\n\nI also suspect, for the same reason, they will like us to explicitly address how much we met our promises (how much we met the call's objective). I am afraid our reviewers are not open to an \"orthogonal\" style of presentation as you suggest.\n\nBut, but. Time is less of a problem as it was in Feb 2017 -- because the reviewers will stay in Brussels until the next day. I would suggest that we indeed aggregate all admin figures and serve them an admin first dish, before we go on presenting our results. We will also need to adjust the time each partner consumes -- last Feb was quite unbalanced (also because of the global time constraint), some of us took far longer than planned. A rehearsal one day earlier will help balance things -- plus, it may well be the last time we will all gather in the same room ...\n\nAgain, this will be part of what needs to be discussed in Milano.", "created_at": "2017-11-07 16:01:24.724664", "updated_at": "2017-11-07 16:01:24.724664", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 362, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38901], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86653, "user_id": 6899, "topic_id": 14766, "post_number": 23, "raw": "The software used by Uber has similarities with SyRI but is much more intrusive because of the amount of data and the possible consequences for drivers.  \n\nOn behalf of the drivers, I have filed two requests.
