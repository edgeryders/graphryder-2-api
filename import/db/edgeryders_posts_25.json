Your argument however that people think rationally or even realise that all they write might be accountable in future and might be detrimental to their own selves is faulty. Few examples? In Israel, IDF soldiers posting on Facebook and being put into prison recently. In Nigeria (if i recall the country), journalists expressing their anger on their blogs and twitter against the government and being jailed subsequently. Why is YouTube banned in Turkey? Not because people are careful and considerate in their posts. No, quite the opposite.

[/quote]\n\nThis is from a study of University of Stuttgart, as quoted in [a German newspaper article](https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2019-05/lebensmittelverschwendung-haushalte-essen-muell-deutschland) from May 2019. Here's the relevant excerpt, translated to English:\n\n[quote]\nIn Germany, almost 13 million tons of food end up in the trash every year. In private households alone, people throw away an average of 85.2 kilograms of food a year. This is shown by new calculations by the University of Stuttgart, which refer to 2015. Including the amount of waste from farmers, food processors, retail and gastronomy, there is a total of 12.7 million tons of wasted food per year.\n\nMore than half of the waste comes from households: around seven million tons are produced here. According to the researchers, around 40 percent of [\u2026] [the waste in] households could be avoided. Consumers could save 37.3 kilos if they shop less, [\u2026] store fruit, vegetables and bread properly and do not throw away leftovers without hesitation. 2.2 million tons come from processing, 1.7 million tons from gastronomy. Of the total amount of food waste, just under 6 to 8.2 million tons can theoretically be avoided.\n[/quote]\n\nThat figure relates to ready-made food for human consumption, after harvest, measured in mass. That makes 12.7 million tons a lower estimate for food waste in Germany. It is also possible to calculate much more radically:\n\n[quote]in 2013, global agriculture produced 9747 kcal per person, out of which 2353 kcal were necessary for human consumption.[i](https://fairdirect.org/blog/food-rescue-app-presentation#sdendnote1sym) This means that (9747 kcal \u2013 2353 kcal) / 9747 kcal = 75.9% of all calories were wasted (as I wrote [here](https://fairdirect.org/blog/food-rescue-app-presentation), sourced from [this study](http://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.310))[/quote]\n\nThat makes meat eating part of the food waste problem, because meat production utilizes 10 calories of animal feed to make one calorie for human consumption, and it is often possible to use the same land to produce calories for direct human consumption.", "created_at": "2020-09-25 13:03:28.245712", "updated_at": "2020-09-25 13:03:28.245712", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 386, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [83717], "is_reply_to": [83717], "is_liked_by": [1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42404, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8160, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Thanks for your input, interest and willingness to contribute @lucy!

It is coming under a work package engaging in the hard data collection and is accompanied by two other layers (ethno and experimental economic), as well as our outreach and community building activities and our social semantic network analysis. \n\n@winnieponcelet and ReaGent are our partners leading the wet citizen science work package, with input and support from others in the network like yourself and @rachel . Edgeryders is the project's overarching conceptual lead and will be leading the outreach and community management. It seems you come in under both but as this proposal is still in development and the consortium is finalised, from my perspective the timing of your offer of connecting partners isn't quite right. IE. We can't bring any more partners on and the proposal is yet to be funded. That being said, there is the possibility of cascading grants and we'll be further developing the model and how they may work in the coming weeks. What I will encourage is that you reference you and your partners work in your dialogue with @winnieponcelet as he develops the conceptual and methodological framework for the wet work package and application with the City of Milan on their cases.

Recently (early 2011) I decided to try to get a job that to show that I am not\u00a0 a complete misfit. I wanted (as I still do) to work in the field of online collaboration between citizens and institutions - hence the video above. I engaged in four interactions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>a European level government institution, that I approached through the traditional channel of applying for a job</li>\n\n<li>a high-profile, government-backed charity in the UK, also approached through the traditional recruitment channel</li>\n\n<li>a multinational tech company, who got in touch with me on the Internet and asked me to engage in their famously exhausting recruitment procedure</li>\n\n<li>another European level government institution, who knew me through previous work and straight-out offered me a position</li>\n\n</ol>Number 1 was a big fail. Basically they do <em>intelligence and language tests.</em> Can you believe it? This essentially means that school has been a nursery, and qualifications are worth nothing. The tests are administrated in a situation of very tight control. The subtext is: \"you are here to cheat, but we will prevent you from doing so\". Not a great way to start a work relationship. I did pass the test, but by then my motivation had disappeared.\n\nNumber 2 was good: a fast, flexible (interviews on Skype) procedure. The people who interviewed me, I think, got what they needed. They did not hire me, I came second. But that is probably OK, they made a call that the other person was a better match.\n\nNumber 3 was not so great: good, clever people, but they seemed to oscillate between looking for somebody with my profile and looking for somebody with a totally different profile. Maybe the recruitment panel had internal disagreement. Problem is, they were taking forever to do this (last time I checked the position was still open, 8 full months after they got in touch with me and 5 months after I accepted another offer!). To be fair, they did warn me that the process could be long.\n\nNumber 4 worked great.\n\nMy take home from the experience: <strong>formal recruitment processes seem to be useless for people with non-standard profiles as me.</strong> What is your experience?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-07 15:43:30", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 06:44:36.287437", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 433, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83303, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 137, "raw": "I read this morning that some of the smoke made it all the way over to Europe..\n\nLuckily for me I have the ability to move around the state to get myself into better air.

The idea of an \"interactive camp\" whithout\u00a0the usual hirachies seems like a very interesting alternative. We are staying in contact now with the people from ROC 21. They are working on new and better structures for refugee camps. Because its important not to separate the different \"problems\" from each other but to organize the camp differently from the very first:\n\n\"We will realize a dynamic and open space of opportunity, growth and co-creation. Everything will be developed participatively, combining the knowledge and cultural needs of refugees and the local population alike. Activating our diverse network of architects, facilitators, academics, designers and social innovators, we will draft a modern and sustainable set of interven- tions that can be combined according to the given needs.\"\n\nand as it happens they are trying it right now here in Berlin! we are going to meet next week, I will report! (check them out here:\u00a0http://www.roc21.net)\n\nThe idea of using the the knowledge, the creativity that is already in the camp as the source to teach and learn is really nice. But I do get Noemis point that the people in the camps, (which are intended to be short term), probably wont be too motivated to start a big project, because actually they hope they can move\u00a0to a better place as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\nBut in fact people are having a lot of time! and they are really bored. But also very very worried. That must be a horrible state of mind. What can we do with it? The experience in the camp\u00a0where we were\u00a0building stuff all together, was really nice because we were doing something with our hands and totally\u00a0forgot the situation around us.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-06 21:31:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.806194", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84805, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 153, "raw": "@alberto, this is a good summary of why Robert Harris, formerly a political journalist, is such an interesting read.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3tPERPLVIs&ab_channel=WHSmith\n\n> Perhaps I could write a novel about politics that was universal, that would mean as much to someone living in Germany, or Italy, or England or America or anywhere in the world, because there are certain laws of politics that are universal and the Romans established much of our language and much of what we think about politics.\n\nI'm not sure that Imperium actually achieves any such universality, but the ambition is there.

Unless I am seriously mistaken, Edgeryders LBG has no choice but being a boutique consulting posse, competing on (extreme) differentiation: and one element of that differentiation might be \"we are going to be rigorous and honest to the point of brutality.

I like this way of differentiating, because it tends to attract clients that think in the same way; and a smart client is a great blessing, as it leads you to do relevant, cutting-edge work.\u00a0\n\nAm I making any sense to you?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-29 15:40:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:56.880498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 225, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79676, "user_id": 6, "topic_id": 13414, "post_number": 45, "raw": "Thanks for such a great write-up of our discussion last week.

But I speak about what I know. The core of this museum is interviewing people about what they do as farmers, butchers, carpenters, and so on, taping, recording objects linked to their jobs and making available this material for the industry. Politicians, anthropologists and others supposed with this material little factories, craftmen would be able to innovate.\n\nBut, it did not work. Why? In my idea, my experience, it's very difficult to record the whole knowledge use by workers, first. Second, the way these knowledges are recording is not correlate with the way used by the end users (factories, craftmen, and so on).\u00a0\n\nAre open data usable? For a part the answer is yes because data are less than knowledge. they look like raw materials. But they look also like garbage. Garbage and raw materials are usable for industry. But what sort of industry and for the use of what?\n\nSome years ago I work as a consultant for strategy. The company for which I worked, produced a lot of data not used. With others I was able to show how to use these data to design new products, cheaper for new markets or new consumers. But this idea failed because the company was not shapped to industrialize these products, to sell it or to get money for financing these new activities.\n\nThat is to say that open data are not useful, usable, for an other part.\n\nWe have to think Open Data as a problem of Industrialization and not just as a political problem. We have to change customs, ways of thinking, acting, shaping companies because a company which uses open data is first a true knowledge company and its products are knolewdges and other data. \"Objects\", \"Services\", are by-products not the core of the activity.\n\nWhat do you thing about my thesis?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-18 18:25:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.402838", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 389, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28393, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 3004, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>arkeb eh </b>\n\n<span>guys do u know arkeb eh \" what to ride (as in transport) <span>\" they made an app that tells u what public transport to take from one place to another , I think only in<span> cairo</span> and its buses metro and minibuses but not microbuses ,</span></span>\n\n<span>may be u can make something like that or even cooperate with them so that u have the other part of the story '\"markabsh eh \" (what not to ride :D)</span>\n\n--------\n\nout of topic\n\ndid anyone mapped the informal micro buses ? it is another issue but it 's interesting and worth a trial :D\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-25 01:08:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.490686", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 162, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8400, "user_id": 2565, "topic_id": 4482, "post_number": 2, "raw": "**GreenMemes link**\n\nHey @Nadia and all,\n\n[Here's]((https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f030Iy1nR66v-mwPMy-ny-lcMaeapWyQ)) a collaborated book by Green Memes about \"Organizing Online Communities\", the one I mentioned in our call it's contributed by many.

Western culture and capitalism are ingrained with a belief of progress, that each day we become more \u201ccivilized\u201d, more \u201cperfect\u201d, more true to the selves that we can become.  We are told that our children will always live better than we do.  But as late-capitalism continues its undeniable destabilization, we can no longer place a blind faith in mere progress.  There is no ability to return to the past, and so in some sense, moving forward is all we can do, but in these times of such uncertainty, we must look towards the past to remember where we have come from.  \n\nFor humanity, the past has always been something to hold dear.  In oral traditions, lessons were passed on to new generations by the retelling of myths and stories, a constant reminder that the struggles of today were the struggles of yesteryear.  In our western culture, we maintain a memory of the past to further bolster our sense of the world.  With the recent passing of Columbus Day in the US, we praise a man and a mindset that is nothing less than genocidal. We praise our presidents as bastions of democracy, albeit forgetting the fact that they were slave-owners.  And recently, we passed the memory of September 11th, a day in the US that is used to justify the hundreds of thousands of deaths wrought by the US military.  Yet not all memory is used for these purposes.  In our own collective, we are nearing the year anniversary of the tragic death of a dear comrade.  As we approach the date, there is clearly a sense of sadness, but as the grief grows more distant, his memory becomes a way to celebrate the life and vision he planted within us.  There are the family memories, the anniversaries of love, of sadness, of all kinds.  For so many of us, time does not function in a linear fashion, but perhaps we are always cycling between the past, present and future.  \n\nIn the context of the west coast of the US on fire, the continuing superstorms hitting the US, and the growing fear of real nuclear war, I\u2019ve come to El Salvador, to the heat and the rain, to celebrate with old friends the 30th anniversary of the town\u2019s repatriation to their community.  My trip was prior to the OpenVillage festival and I was lucky enough to be sponsored by the fellowship fund.  \n\nFrom roughly 1981 to 1992, the small country of El Salvador was devastated by a brutal civil war.  Heavily funded by the US, the El Salvadorian government and the guerrilla army of the FMLN waged a war that tore the country apart for nearly a decade.  Countless massacres of civilian populations, the initiation of \u201cscorched earth\u201d fighting initiated by the School of Americas in the US, and continued poverty, forced the communities of El Salvador to flee the country.  In the area of Cabanas, in the northeast, many of the communities became refugees in Honduras, living in large encampments.  After 7 years as refugees miles away from their own community, many populations made the decision to relocate to El Salvador, even though the war raged on.  It was a decision of desperation and desire for a new way of living, courageously deciding to no longer live in fear, but rather, to forge ahead in their own land.  In the camps, abject poverty was rampant, along with the continued abuses of the Honduran and El Salvadoran governments.  For anyone who has been to a refugee camp, it is barely a life, let alone a place to raise a family for seven years.  And so, with the war raging on in the country, the populations returned their homeland.  Many were not able to return to their specific lands or they returned to a community infrastructure demolished by years of war.  \n\nIn the town of Santa Marta, the first of three large contingents of refugees returned to rolling hills, pot-marked by the deep holes of U.S. made bombs.  Receiving some assistance from UNHCR and other NGO groups, they were given building materials to build a community.  In the 30 years that followed, a community blossomed.  Being campesinos themselves, there was a lot of material support for the guerrilla movement, with many of the combatants from the communities themselves. Houses were built, dirt roads created, land was bought from the landowners and communalized, with each farmer taking care of a small plot.  Educational programs such as ADES were built, with the express purpose of creating varied structures in which to support the overall social development of the community.  Surrounded by conservative, pro-government strongholds, the community focused on developing its own material power and autonomy.  \n\nAs the years progressed, a new generation of youth, many of whom were born in the refugee camps began to take on the struggle for autonomy.   They formed groups to address needs that were present within the communities.  Often undertaking the work for years without compensation, going to school full-time, and helping with family duties, they built organizations that have become vital to the community.  Greenhouses for communal food autonomy, teaching new methods of agriculture to older farmers, physical therapists bringing massage and movement therapies to the clinic, youth groups working to create space for LGBTQ struggles, working against centuries old patriarchy and violence, psychiatrists working to provide communal mental health services, and finding ways to avoid the traps of mass emigration or gangs that the youth in rural poor areas always face.  \n\nIn so doing, these youth find ways to honor the memory of those who have come before.  Not a blind faith, but a continuation of the vision for a new world.  From the historical figures like Che, whose face can be seen everywhere in the town, to the injured combatants of the community, to the beautiful faces of the next generation running through the mud, the memory of what has been infuses the town with a strength.  As explained in the theme of the festival, \u201cwith the injured, we build the future which will strengthen us by honoring those who have fallen.\u201d  The cycle of generations finds its rhythm in the ebb and flow of past and future.  \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5a193a171fae3976d9e52ac9451bb47764097bd3.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6bc0f01b6f205641c632550bffe5ee72fb61ca68.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">\n\n\n_The War Stories_\n\nOne thing that permeates the town is a sense of connection.  Not just to each other, but through history.  Walking with a friend who had participated in the war as a doctor from Mexico, it becomes impossible to walk more than 10 feet without someone calling his name, a chance encounter that leads into story after story.  The way the history of each other comes out humbles the mind.  The man we meet walking to his farm is a dear friend from the war, who begins recalling the stories of working within enemy lines for 12 years, stealing arms from the government forces.  \u201cWe never fired a shot, but used our heads,\u201d he keeps saying, as much a lesson for us as for his younger self.  The path we walk is no longer just a path in a beautiful countryside, but the \u201cguerrilla path\u201d.  And over there by that tree, that\u2019s \u201cwhere I stepped on a mine and lost my eye\u201d, says our friend.  The stories from a fellow comrade in the US, who was doing field research in the beginning of the war in this community, recalls the 14 days he spent in El Salvador, 12 of which were under fire.  His story of being a young idealist coming up against the real terror of machine gun fire, running through the hills with the community, losing track of time and his mind as fear overtook his body, still cause you to forget to breath decades later.  The photos of old comrades, most of them dead it seems, the older generation laughing and at the same time holding a far away look into memory.  The stories of heroism alongside the complex stories of fear taking over.  And even now, the anger still felt at decisions made, sacrifices made, the way the PTSD permeates relationships often more than 30 years later.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e196a1373e8e395b285a5dc83271219c8aa16f15.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27b1c4453e6767debe63e13a8deaf82e95aca9e3.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\n_Autonomy_  \n\nMany of the young generation, those that are now new parents and community leaders, were born in the refugee camps.  They returned to El Salvador with their families in the midst of the civil war.  They have since developed into the leaders of many of the autonomous projects within Santa Marta.  While there is some funding to these projects, mainly from community groups, international grants, and some NGO sponsorship, most of the people are volunteering many hours a week to the projects.    \n\nFive years ago I worked with CoCoSi, which is a youth led organization to increase awareness around HIV and domestic violence.  They have since blossomed into a large group with more than a decade of experience of increasing education around HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive rights and sovereignty, LGBTQ issues, and eradication of domestic violence.  In addition, they have been vital in facilitating access to health resources such as anti-retrovirals for vulnerable populations, including sex workers and prison inmates.  \n\nOne of the larger projects is the \u201cGreenhouse\u201d.  It is a rapidly growing group of structures at the edge of town, run by a collection of young adults in the community, with the goal of transforming food cultivation in the region and providing food autonomy to the town.  They have taught themselves, through extensive travel and study, many of the diverse practices of organic farming.  In a region where the use of pesticides is rampant, they strive to re-create more traditional ways of farming.  Because of the economic climate, most farmers focus on corn and beans, used for some level of subsistence living but also for sale.  This practice has led to an overall decrease in vegetable growing, which becomes problematic as it is coupled with the rise of processed food dependence seen all over the world. The leaders at the greenhouse recognize that most of the produce one can buy in the nearby town are the rejects from prosperous nations, such as the US, and are likely grown with heavy reliance on pesticides.  So they hold classes for people to learn to start their own small scale gardens, sell most of their produce at below market rates, and hold classes for the local farmers to learn pesticide free ways of growing food.  \n\nIn addition, there are a wide array of health and care related projects.  Two young women run the Rehab Center, utilizing massage and physical therapy to work with many of the individuals with disabilities in the community.  There is the local psychiatrist who is forming community mental health groups where people can talk about their mental well being in safe environments.  Many of these projects arise from a failure of the government to provide such resources.  In addition, it stems from a general understanding that the government will likely not provide such services and that they must own their own models of care and social reproduction.  \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1f9d1e8dce4e349eb2e1b76e7653cfaa9ba2b651.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/40b364b4f973c0dea17f76e85fe70a210a6cbdbe.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fa1f2ad1091cce9746b9bdaf977e454a6f271f1d.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/122a2894e25b291ddd94afc52dcb3c4da0f91acd.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f1b88b452491cbf65d561ba6f57f940284950d34.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0a418e8868afb310ec54a2342e026dc3b0191415.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bace24144bb6018731ed5a093e5c54c60eef596c.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we move beyond the OpenVillage Festival, we must remember the paths that we have come from and work to develop a strong sense of cultural memory.  The dominant culture has its own models of memory, which for many of us, no longer hold a viable future.  The community in Santa Marta has been pivotal in my understanding of that failure.  Instead, we must look to our revolutionary pasts to be able to reimagine a new world, a world in which we can walk together towards the idea of a \u201cgood life\u201d. \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/36e8e88a136f10466767b6b71ae0d319711e2861.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">", "created_at": "2017-11-02 21:49:39.529800", "updated_at": "2017-11-02 21:49:39.529800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2118, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 363.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3362, 1935, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8549, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3007, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Looking for hosting?</b>\n\nHi Emil, I think I accidentally sent you a welcome message in Romanian, your name sounded familiar.

His main point in case is that those belonging to the same entity in terms of activity/interest (that is either a big company, organization, etc) are more likely to feel themselves part of it and thus give it more loyalty, etc. than those belonging to one nation-state.\n\nI think its also him that gives a simple example, based on extensive research across industries, that two IT people from very different countries are more alike - as in think alike, behave a like, find each other's company more interesting, etc. - than an IT specialist and say a UN bureaucrat from the same nation state.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-02 06:41:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.645685", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 271, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2510, "user_id": 315, "topic_id": 2477, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Post-event (Learn/Share Lab), we are reflecting more on what being co-creative means and how we can learn from each other about practicing it.

We looked at all the notes we had from the story arcs, world cafe, open space, and more. Then we pulled together a possible table of contents. We will be working with the team, presenters, and participants to coordinate self-selection of topics for contributions to the book. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-eacqo_I4yyx7ZbLKOlHxNtAQeZaKdRXoMm2WJ6-jQ/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-eacqo_I4yyx7ZbLKOlHxNtAQeZaKdRXoMm2WJ6-jQ/edit?usp=sharing</a> We are eager to hear your feedback on the outline here.

I was talking about modelling the Protocol in a formal way. However, I do not know the Rule/Protocol and I am very curious to know if you already have any ideas on how to encode the Protocol into the framework described in the paper.\n\nI do not know NetLogo. If I am not wrong, it is the modelling language used in the online courses organized by SFI. I followed a couple of lectures last year. However, what if we use Javascript? Javascript shouldn't be fast with array operations (i.e. arrays are dynamic if you do not use Typed Arrays) and does not have a lot of math libraries (numericjs seems the best one). However, I do not feel it is a big issue for the kind of modelling we are going to tackle. The big plus for js is that it has the best user interface declarative language on the market (i.e. HTML), it is very widespread and there are a lot of cool tools for data visualization (d3.js, raphael.js). A web page where you can move knobs to set parameters and see the result in real time is quite easy to do in js/html and very impressive.\n\nAbout my availability. Untransit has priority. I am going to finish it in these weeks (between June and July).

Marcin is a visionary thinker, and visions need that ingredient of being ahead of their time (a bit) to inspire people for practical action. I doubt they would've got the TED publicity etc. if they had framed it as a more modest approach ...\n\nThat said, I agree that there will be much benefit from their work even if the result is not the ultimate success of DIY civilization that they work for.

It's likewise an experiment, likewise a bit utopian, and likewise meant to be useful even if not ultimately successful. To my knowledge, it is the first collection of all the open source, open design and sharing economy projects that are going on these days and would be useful for autarkic, DIY civilization.

The shared format will enable us to weave together our different pieces of the puzzle into a structure which makes it easy to understand and share.\n\nPlease add your bit to the Edgeryders (hi)story here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1mjZNXX\">http://bit.ly/1mjZNXX</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Image credit: Topographic Map by Nicky Knicky.</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1mjZNXX\">http://bit.ly/1mjZNXX</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-14 17:19:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.447703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 285, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40942, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 7935, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Interesting idea you two!..

In fact, I'd recommend every wingle author out there who is tired of being rejected by publishers to go the amazon way. At least, that way they'd get published, which is the most frustrating point in any author's career.\n\nI'm not an author, though. I'm an editor. And no, I never wanted to be a publisher, just had to be this time. Editing a book is a process of co-creation that usually (when it's well done) creates a more satisfying final book for both parties involved. As an example, the first book we'll be publishing (which is already online in a somewhat different format in\u00a0<a href=\"http://endoma.net/\">http://endoma.net/</a>) was supposed to never see the light in book format at the beginning, and finally we've decided on audio integration, full hypertext linkage between poems and perfect kindle and iPad operability. That was reached thanks to the chats between yours truly and the author, and our separate ways the book would have come out somewhat diminished.\n\nWhile I agree that amazon gives a brilliant deal, and that via the kindle app you reach almost all devices that matter, I wanted (and I think the author did as well) to profit from the particularities possible with ibooks. For that, one cannot go amazon only.\n\nAbout the marketing and advertisement, indeed that's a hard one to chew. Publishers only do that (and usually very badly) for 'important' authors. And that is done by publishers who actually do have a marketing budget, i.e., huge ones. Signing with a huge publisher when being unknown is a practical impossibility nowadays, and even if one gets the famous contract it'll probably be an experience in pain.\u00a0\n\nI'm trying to be different from amazon in not looking for sheer volume, but quality, and in working with the author to take the most out of the book. If that means spending endless hours in working -fighting- with the format, so be it. Amazon, no matter how nice they can be at times, won't offer an editor for your own work. I'm hoping that difference means enough. And the author will still be in amazon.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-08 11:41:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.181139", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 407, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74953, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Is anyone doing more cooking and baking than usual?

Would like to connect and find out more.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-16 20:11:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.807094", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 185, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29629], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40931, "user_id": 4259, "topic_id": 7935, "post_number": 2, "raw": "merci pour tous ces merveilleux mots simple et motiv\u00e9 \n et oui moi qui dit ces mots @noemi \n\nBon Id\u00e9e et \u00e7a peut \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 sur le terrain facilement  comme nous le savons tous les r\u00eaves qui ne se transforme sur terrain ont rest\u00e9s seulement r\u00eave .. et je pense que je suis et tout ce que j'ai rencontr\u00e9s dans Edgeryders nous avons un r\u00eave en commun: mieux demain pour meilleure g\u00e9n\u00e9ration  pour une vie meilleure \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nEdgeryders groupe se sont des petits exemplaires de le plus part de peuple Tunisien mais avec diff\u00e9rents mentalit\u00e9 et des mieux comp\u00e9tence \nPersonnellement je essayer toujours \u00e0 participer \u00e0 tous les activit\u00e9s et tout le projet dans tous la Tunisie et ce pas participer c tt nn j essayer de \u00eatre un leader ce juste pour que je montre a l autre gens que le vrai handicap ce l handicap mental pas l handicap physique et alhamdoulilleh je passe mon but \u00e0 l'autre gens avec succ\u00e8s \u2764\ufe0f\nEt \u00e7a me rend heureux quand je trouve les edgeryders de mednine travail ensemble pour un but commun pour tous \nJ entrain de pr\u00e9parer mon projet j veux le pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 vous quand il fini et pour koi pas vous ferez partie de mon r\u00eave qui je cherche de transformer en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \nEt je suis toujours disponible pour tous les prochains projet de edgeryders \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "created_at": "2018-01-03 20:01:34.826928", "updated_at": "2018-01-03 20:01:34.826928", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 231, "wiki": false, "reads": 42, "score": 223.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3812, 5, 4088, 4, 3, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76032, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 21, "raw": "![GMODetective_ex|690x389](upload://hJDSD8jSZDiXPC6zT4DxLEjpiYU.jpeg) \n\nlike this...\na DIY fluor detector too!", "created_at": "2020-05-08 06:52:30.975170", "updated_at": "2020-05-08 06:52:30.975170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76030], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81185, "user_id": 6576, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 105, "raw": "@hugi\nBeing new to the community, I just discovered EarthOS.

Introduction](#heading--1)**\n\n**[2. Adding headings and link targets](#heading--2)**\n\n**[3. Adding the table of contents](#heading--3)**\n\n----\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Introduction</h2>\n\nAny long post with well-structured content can benefit from a table of contents. It provides a quick way to jump down to the desired section.\n\nWhile a table of contents is good for navigability and general user experience, it is a bonus: not having it doesn't ruin your post.\n\nFor good examples of Tables of Contents according to the instructions below, you can look at the following topics:\n\n* [Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](/t/id/44)\n* [Using the edgeryders.eu website](/t/id/6463) (it's a wiki \u2013 edit it to see how the ToC is done)\n* [Administrating the edgeryders.eu website](/t/id/6647) (it's a wiki \u2013 edit it to see how the ToC is done)\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Adding headings and link targets</h2>\n\nBefore you can add a table of contents, you need elements in your content to jump to. Our convention is to use use headings and sub-headings, with a decimal classification scheme for numbering. In your post you would enter it like this:\n\n    ## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Heading of first chapter</h2>\n\n    [Other content, probably paragraphs of text and stuff.]\n\n    ### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Heading of first sub-chapter</h3>\n    \n    \n    ## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Heading of second chapter</h2>\n\n    [Other content, probably paragraphs of text and stuff.]\n\n\n**Usage hints:**\n\n* **No H1 headings.** For the headings in your text, start with the H2 headings (`## Heading title`) because this is also done when using the \"Heading\" button in the integrated editor. (Means, do not use H1 headings (`# <h1 id=\"heading--\u2026\">\u2026</h1>`) at all, even though they do work.)\n\n* **Subpart markers in Discourse.** Discourse is picky about what subpart markers will work in links. You can only use the following. In all cases, the `id` and `name` attribute values must not contain space characters, and it is a common convention to use only lowercase letters and dashes.\n\n    * `<h2 id=\"heading--\u2026\"></h2>` and similarly for H3 to H5 ([source](https://forum.digikey.com/t/1125#heading--TableofContents))\n    * `<h6 id=\"heading--\u2026\"></h6>` element for invisible link target, not showing the content of the heading element; this is our own CSS hack to use for link targets independent of a table of contents, and you're welcome to use non-numerical ID values here\n    * `<a name=\"\u2026\"></a>` elements but better not as these only work when clicking a link in the same post as the target \u2013 so inside a table of contents it works, but you cannot send a working link with a subpart marker to a friend. The `<h\u2026 id=\"heading--\u2026\">` mechanism, in contrast, works everywhere.\n\n* **Subpart markers for ToC.** We have based the names for the subpart markers on the chapter numbers. In practice, this is nicer to work with than creating arbitrary names for the subpart markers, even though you have to adapt them when chapter numbers change of course.\n\n* **Combining Markdown and HTML headings.** Technically we would not need the `##` or `###` Markdown formatting for headings, as the same is provided by the HTML tags afterwards. (The Markdown formatting even creates empty, invisible heading tags on its own.) However, by convention we keep the source code as close as possible to what the Discourse editor's buttons would produce, and that's headings in the `##`, `###` etc. scheme. Markdown does not yet allow to create subpart markers, so we use the HTML heading tags as a workaround until it does one day.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Adding the table of contents</h2>\n\nWhile you _can_ [format](/t/6761) your table of contents in your own way, for consistency across topics we recommend using the following example as your style guide:\n\n```\n## Content\n\n**[1. Markdown](#heading--1)**\n\n  * [1.1. Markdown formatting cheatsheet](#heading--1-1)\n  * [1.2. Markdown formatting details](#heading--1-2)\n\n**[2. BBCode formatting](#heading--2)**\n\n  * [2.1. Basic text formatting](#heading--2-1)\n  * [2.2. Lists, Images, Code](#heading--2-2)\n  * [2.3. Special features](#heading--2-3)\n\n----\n```\n\nThis will create a table of contents looking like this (just without the quotation background coloring):\n\n> ## Content\n> \n> **[1. Markdown](#heading--1)**\n> \n>   * [1.1. Markdown formatting cheatsheet](#heading--1-1)\n>   * [1.2. Markdown formatting details](#heading--1-2)\n> \n> **[2. BBCode formatting](#heading--2)**\n> \n>   * [2.1. Basic text formatting](#heading--2-1)\n>   * [2.2. Lists, Images, Code](#heading--2-2)\n>   * [2.3. Special features](#heading--2-3)\n> \n> ----\n\n**Usage hints:**\n\n* **Basic idea.** The basic principle is that a hyperlink that you create in your text, for example `[1. Heading of first chapter](#heading--1)`, will appear in your text as \"[1. Heading of first chapter](#heading--1)\" and on click will make the document jump to section 1.

Which ones do you wish to attend?** <br /> Webinar: Localisation of Food - 30 October from 18:00-20:00 <br /><br /> **What is your name?** <br /> Jasen Lakic <br /><br /> **Are you part of a project or an organisation? What does the project/organisation do, and why?** <br /> Well as of next year I will be back in Croatia as my main base. I will continue my work within the EU funded rural development structure there by helping the less informed or badly served locals. I just came from Croatia and a lot of people asked for help with their projects. Also, I will try implementing 2 bigger projects: one linked with education and the other with agriculture and sustainable development.\nI was also approached by an association of local producers to help place their product abroad, as I have a company in Brussels too. I am thinking of starting an online shop with quality Croatian products and offering them to existing bio/organic smaller shops in Brussels.\n <br /><br /> **Let's get to know each other. Which of the following topics is the most relevant to you?** <br /> Sustainability in agriculture or food <br /><br /> **Think about the topic.. and tell us: What is a practical problem that you have in your work/projects or personal life?** <br /> The biggest problem I want to solve at the moment is: how to offer affordable quality food from local producers to LOCALS in Croatia.\nCurrently the system does not support something like that, driving the production cost of such goods so high that the average Croat OR BELGIAN cannot afford it.\nI believe the solution is in efficiency (shared facilities/machinery) and growing smaller surface but higher yield goods in a more controlled environment. The climate change is real and farmers are seeing the direct impact of it.\nOffering very affordable, quality food should be a priority because it is supposed to be a human right, not a luxury. Our health and our freedom depend on it. I believe the government implements a lot of laws which take away our freedoms, food is just step 1. Self reliance, sustainability, 0 waste, work/life balance, community cooperation through direct democracy etc... <br /><br /> **How is your government helping this, or not helping?** <br /> Well there are two sides to it, just like anything else. Government as an entity is influenced too much by private power (financially etc), so some decisions made are quite harmful for most of the population (like seeds standardisation laws). They argue it is for the protection of the end user but the current industrial agricultural model encouraged by seed producers is pure monopoly. It also leads both to degradation of our health and degradation of our environment, which will be most felt by our children.\nThe policies in place have both increased the price of food production and damaged the natural evolution of our plants, which naturally adapt to the soil and climate conditions wherever they are planted.\n\nOn the other hand, government is made of many individuals and organisations and a lot of them do work hard to help as much as they can... <br /><br /> **Are you interested to co-host an event with EdgeRyders in the next months? If so, do you have ideas to engage others near you to participate?** <br /> Hmmmm, can't think of anything now and I am not sure I will have the time in the next 4 months.\nIt could be interesting as of March next year. If our activities align. I will be in Croatia for sure and working on agriculture and  sustainability for sure.  <br /><br /> **undefined** <br /> true <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-10-14 17:47:59.448011", "updated_at": "2020-10-14 17:47:59.448011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 622, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 48.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 6658], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16989, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6170, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Luxury</b>\n\nThey have the luxury to choose, then :) No. 2 and 3 also apply to the RSS button I added to the Challenge Responses view, as it's also implemented as a \"Feed\" type view display: <a href=\"/en/admin/structure/views/view/challenge_responses/edit/feed_1\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/admin/structure/views/view/challenge_responses/edit/feed_1</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-06 23:24:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.893264", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 65, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14017], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82714, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 127, "raw": "[https://zoom.us/j/4149496930](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F4149496930&data=02%7C01%7C%7Cf87e7e8689304e3619b908d7c82e2bb5%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C637197972933729447&sdata=Iqq4nYS9XWJ%2BkgdW8mdyUpaofYbYQYHHmwrd6KOCi3o%3D&reserved=0)", "created_at": "2020-09-03 13:00:46.278666", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 13:00:46.278666", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82713], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7915, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 827, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>\"Independent footcare clinic\": change title of your story?</b>\n\nHi @Michael_Dunn and welcome!

This would permit researchers working with a jointly understood taxonomy to access only 'project-specific' data where necessary. @Matthias\u00a0As for the extra nodal information, I'm not sure what data-structures Drupal contains internally which couldn't be expressed in rendered html for later aggregation alongside such annotations.

This was necessary, since I had found out that the Zenodo data previously published by @melancon and @jason_vallet had not been pseudonymized. \n\nBut it has an additional advantage: now we have published three datasets, each relating to an ethno project (OpenCare, POPREBEL, NGI Forward) with exactly the same structure.

I think it is safe to say there has never been an open ethnographic dataset of comparable size. \n\nShould we do something with it? Should we try to go deeper into abstraction? By this I mean analysis of the structure, rather than the semantics. It would be about trying to recognize patterns in how collective intelligence works in large conversations.

Sexier formulation: does interaction lead to more interesting insights for the analysts? \n* Is a post more likely to be annotated depending on the social network metrics of its author (eg. centrality)?\n* Can we estimate the likelihood that a post will be found interesting by ethnographers?

I'm an engineer and designer. I am also one of the founders of Edgeryders and do a lot of the creative direction for our work.  \n<br> \n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/0882f48e-b98e-4132-9a8e-e4c2b6eff66b/-/preview/)\n\nThat photo of my sister and I was taken in 1990 in front of our home in Kuwait City.  \n\nA few weeks later we would be in a car racing through a desert as the world burned.\n<br>\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/e3c32bea-4160-4c96-8b95-1dea806bc06a/-/preview/)\n<br>\nIn different world, Alberto's band, Modena City Ramblers, was working its way into rock history in his native Italy. \n<br>\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/189b313e-447c-4721-b77e-e650caa8bae1/-/preview/)\n<br>\n@Matthias was probably picking apart some machine or the other in his parents' half built house out in a German village. @Hugi, was playing with other toddlers in Reykjavik. @Noemi was growing up in a country now on the path away from communism. John was building the world's first online community, the Well. \n<br>\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/3ae59ab1-406c-47bb-892d-5b451d4dd64d/-/preview/)\n<br>\nSoon after I dragged Alberto to a hacker unconference, we started working on a research project at the council of Europe where we met Noemi. The three of us were tasked with figuring out how governments could support youth coping with mass unemployment and widespread precarity. This was 2011 - the year of the anti acta protests, occupy, los indignados, arab spring +++.\n\nOn an open online platform we built, hundreds of individuals shared experiences from trying to build lives in the aftermath of the worst financial meltdown in our lifetime. We needed a way to process all this information. So we developed a methodology and some software to help us see what all of these conversations were telling us.\n<br>\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/9e5f8278-1027-4d85-acf6-f5e7dff71026/-/preview/)\n<br>\nA pattern emerged from these conversations.  What was needed to cope with chaotic environments was not to attain a specific status on the labour market. It was infrastructure on which we could build good lives while doing work that is meaningful to us. Living, emergent infrastructure that weaves together the relational, physical and organisational.\n\nIt needed to be resilient to the shocks that would soon be upon us due to climate crisis, ecosystems collapse and a financial system gone rogue. So we prototyped what such an infrastructure could look like.\n<br>\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/ae67658a-e949-46f4-b15b-55463981cdb4/-/preview/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/48a7b579-431f-457d-b763-83726013cf31/-/preview/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b1808e14-01fd-49cd-81dd-db6f5a3f933e/-/preview/)\n<br>\nWe documented the experience extensively. What we learned is that the best plan for us is no plan. Rather our approach would be to weave together and grow a large and diverse enough collective of talented people. With whom to build and adapt what we need along the way.\n\nThe original software for sensemaking is now part of a stack of digital tools for distributed co-creation, our own messaging apps, virtual coworking rooms etc. And people are using the infrastructure, tools and practices to build new projects and businesses. \n<br>\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/56176b27-1924-4dc7-8e2d-3b79f2f8aa0f/-/preview/)\n<br>\nSeen from here, the situation right now is not unlike it was during that fateful year when the world broke (open) for me. This state of immobility in which we find ourselves makes it even clearer: we are one another's best resource in this no man's land between what is no more and what is not yet.\n\nAs I write this countless people are losing their jobs and businesses. Of course there is the shared baseline challenge of navigating a tough economic situation. And as a brown person in the west, the sense of precarity is even higher as ethno-nationalists and fascists question your value as a human, in some cases questioning you very right to exist. It\u2019s ripping open a lot of anxieties. I left my own country after being chased down a metro by angry men in brown clothes and receive anonymous racist death threats from randos, affecting my ability to feel at ease in social settings. I have found my own coping mechanisms, building edgeryders has been a key source of support.  What I hope to come out of the event is some insights into what others are doing and if there might be space for meaningful new collaborations moving forward.\n\nFor me there is an additional dimension to this. Watching the news right now as an ethnic minority with roots in two countries currently experiencing extreme geopolitical turmoil is bringing up a lot of additional concerns. \n\nMy own intuition is that people like us who run productive  physical and online spaces could help many more people to navigate this and future storms. **How can infrastructures that different parts of the coworking/ remote working ecosystem provide support for groups that are especially at risk right now?** \n\nOne of the ways in which i have been keeping myself sane is to focus on *the future of distributed work.* John O'Duinn and I had a long chat about this, he's been doing a lot of work on the topic for quite some time. More specifically - upskilling critical mass of people to discover and adopt the way we work to build productive communities. One of those initiatives is a MOOC (it's not launched yet, we are finalising the touches on the communication materials, but you can see it in progress [here](https://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu).\n\nI am curious, about your own experiences/ observations about the situation right now and what questions it is bringing up for you? \n\nDo consider introducing yourself in a comment!\n\nLooking forward to read you :)", "created_at": "2020-07-08 11:09:11.841569", "updated_at": "2020-07-19 21:00:06.360010", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1025, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 85.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 6442, 6425, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28942, "user_id": 2115, "topic_id": 3221, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Python</b>\n\nwith Tulip does part of the job :) but yes it starts from python to extract the country, and actually Tulip makes it fairly easy to geotag with the geographic view... when it does not crash.

I come to makerfox because either I have something I can offer or am looking for something I need/want, or browsing to see is currently in the system (Im curious and not really looking for anything in particular, like windowshopping) . So on arrival, the available options to do one of the above needs to be clearly presented in those terms for me to understand what to do next. If I have to learn what is meant by different terms it is confusing. (We have the same problem on the Edgeryders site, and its one of the things I was trying to address with the content I put in the home page).\n\n2. In the case where I am visiting because with an aim, I either try to find out how I can make my offer visible to others, or how to check whether what I am looking for is available. If what I am looking for is not available, I want to know is there someway I can tell the world/other users that I am looking for it?\u00a0\n\nSo moving on to the next steps as related to LOTE4, this is what I am doing today:\n\nI am setting up all the crucial tasks in the LOTE4-The Stewardship group. And then I will ask you to put them into Makerfox manually. If there is a unique Makerfox offer URL for each task/request for help can link each task on Edgeryders.eu to the right page on Makerfox.com.\n\nTo make it easier for us to work as a distributed team (so people can start taking on different tasks in parallel) and for you to have a visual overview of what goes into Makerfox, I want to as for your help in setting up a minisite page that serves as a <a href=\"/t/modify-this-group-into-the-lote4-event-minisite/2987\">tasks dashboard</a>. I already tried but couldn't make it work for some reason. It looks like Matthias <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-dashboard\">started working on it here</a> but it's not finished.\n\nIf you can help with this I wanted to ask to use the same CSS as Ben used for the other <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-program\">LOTE4 minisite page</a>.

(However, after several people expressed the wish to add wishes even where nothing is on offer yet, we're adding this; expect a \"Connect\" menu item for that in the next 2-3 days.) We have also reworked the second level menu items a bit based on your feedback to be less confusing.\n\nWhat you wanted to do in the version as it is now is: browsing / searching through the list of catalogue services in the second screenshot to see if there is such a service in the catalogue. Probably not, since we're just building up the catalogue data. So I'd add the service and service description when you tell me, other users can then register to \"offer\" that service, and you can then \"order\" their service with the \"Order now ...\" button.\n\nNote this difference between services and products: services are grouped in catalogue offers standardized by us, products are not (because it's such a mess that we do not even want to start standardizing). Standardizing is useful because it allows you to order multiple alternatives of the same service, from different sellers: you'll get only one if you need only one, but the Makerfox needs the flexibility to choose in order to find a network barter trade that makes everyone happy ...\n\nAs for an initial intro, the Makerfox has two YouTube videos online.

We live in symbiosis with a 4,000+ global online community with roots in hacker culture. That lead us to build up considerable expertise in harvesting collective intelligence.\n\n**We do this through a novel method called Semantic Social Network Analysis** (SSNA). The main idea is to foster an online conversation; perform ethnographic coding on it. Then, we build a network of ethnographic codes that surface in the conversation. By associating codes, participants in the conversation connect them to each other. This process induces a semantic social network, which we can then study with quantitative techniques. You can think of it as a collective mental map of the problem at hand. We have developed software to navigate this map, and filter it to produce high-level \"big pictures\". With it, human researchers can make sense of very large graphs, with thousands of contributions and ethnographic codes. \n\n**This method is a good fit for Horizon 2020 projects**. Many calls reward proposals who ensure citizen participation and/or diverse stakeholder involvement. We can provide those, at scale. Ethnography is great at hearing the individual voices in a crowd; and SSNA can handle very large ethnographic exercises.\n\n**A natural application of SSNA to Horizon 2020 is Coordination and Support Actions**. These actions work by bringing together communities working on one issue. The resulting interaction produces written traces, and we can encode them into a semantic social network. This produces quantitative indicators on the conversation the action is meant to support.\n\nWe would love to join high-quality Horizon 2020 partnerships, and bring them SSNA. We are hard working, deadline-hitting people. Happy to write our own work package.

Sicily's economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. Yet, over the past ten years or so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process. They call themselves \"the Messina advanced cluster\".\n\nTo get where they are now, they had to re-invent a lot of economic concepts. The familiar ones (\"maximizing shareholder value\", \"correct market failures\" etc.) were simply not working out for Sicily, and for their goals. So, as they re-built their local economy, they developed their own economic thinking, with concepts such as \"relational goods\", \"stocks as autonomy\", and \"systems, not networks\". Even their innovation is weird: solar panels made out of the pulp of waste oranges? A People's Energy Company? \n\nIn this online event, you will learn how they built this incredible success under very difficult conditions, and how their way of thinking might help you along your own journey.\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n# Featured Participants\n\n### Gaetano Giunta -  [Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 di Messina](http://www.fdcmessina.org)\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3LXWy285v0/maxresdefault.jpg\n\n*\u201cIn the early 90\u2019s, after the mafia murders of the most important Italian anti-mafia judges and a long period of killing, in Sicily we thought we could change the world only with the enthusiasm of our activism.

Science fiction is one of them.* \n\n*Another one is local communities who attempt to reboot their economies in more humane and long-term resilient ways. Among these, the advanced social district in Messina stands out for depth of vision and effectiveness of implementation.

At the moment we focus on a workshop: 2 hours of proactive failure activities that handle participants some concrete means to prepare for, handle and blamelessly talk about failure.\n\nSince Edgeryders is a community of people that is used to trying new things, maybe most of you already know how to fail. All the more reason for you to help us teach this skill out there!\n\nIf you know any good techniques that help people\n\n* prepare for the possibility of failure\n\n* deal with failure when it's happening/has just happened\n\n* talk about failure without blaming/shaming others or oneself\n\nPlease let us know in a comment below!\n\nThanks!", "created_at": "2014-07-17 14:15:16", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 20:39:34.572647", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 253, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15833, "user_id": 1605, "topic_id": 3372, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Date confusion</b>\n\nThere are two events with the same name and overlapping date ranges.

Built from a material known locally as kershef (large chunks of salt from the lake just outside town, mixed with rock and plastered in local clay), the labyrinth of huddled buildings was originally four or five storeys high and housed hundreds of people. For centuries, few outsiders were admitted inside \u2013 and even fewer came back out to tell the tale. But three days of rain in 1926 caused more damage than any invader had managed and, over the last decades, inhabitants moved to newer and more comfortable houses with running water and electricity. Now only a few buildings around the edges are occupied or used for storage, including the Old Mosque with its chimney-shaped minaret.\n\nRead more:\u00a0http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/western-desert/siwa-oasis/sights/military/fortress-shali#ixzz38WZFK8QF\n\nBefore renovation:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/235685343205843/photos/a.235707076537003.53002.235685343205843/235711476536563/?type=3&amp;theater\n\nDuring and after renovation:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/235685343205843/photos/a.235707076537003.53002.235685343205843/235707489870295/?type=3&amp;theater\n\nThis fortress was neglected for decades till an Egyptian business man bought the entrance to the old city, restored it and turned it into a hotel. Other houses were bought by foreigners who could afford the price of the house and the renovation work. There are two type of contracts: a preliminary and a definitive. They have the preliminary contract which means that the government could take back the house after certain time. The original owners of the wrecked houses were able to buy a land, build modern houses, and cultivate vegetables and palm trees. The new owners restored the houses and preserved parts of the old fortress and for me it seemed to be like a win - win situation. I was able to see how the houses were before they were affected by the 3 days rain.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-26 00:13:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:55.355374", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 352, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935, 2566], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3411, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3378, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd34d200783869841a0d67cfb25b13021c9f1d26.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\"><br>\n\n<b>What it's all about:</b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://goo.gl/jcX9C5\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">http://goo.gl/jcX9C5</a>\n\nIncreasing impact of existing projects and programs.\u00a0Getting new initiatives off the ground and keeping them there.\u00a0Building a collaborative stewardship ecosystem to better take care of physical, digital and community assets.\u00a0\n\n<b>Where and when?\u00a0</b>It all takes place at the unMonastery, Matera.

I know that Alberto is interested to see how traffic from Facebook comes to the Edgeryders website. Does Google analytics still lag 12 hours? Maybe give it some time before checking. Either way, given time constraints we may want to devise a strategy for communicating directly with nearly 200 new page likers from Armenia (and counting!), starting with the handful of Armenians who are communicating directly with us via form or DM as a result of this ad campaign. @noemi @nadia @alberto @vahagn\u00a0\n\nMy suggestion is that we go old school, divvy up the list of new likers and copy and paste a greeting message via our personal FB accounts to theirs (or via twitter if we can find them there)? FB isn't going to give us their email addresses for free, of course.\u00a0\n\nAnother thing we can do to strengthen signals to this new crowd is to write on Facebook post in Armenian then pay money again to FB to \"boost\" who gets to see it on their newsfeed. One thing I love about the new post boosting option is that advanced targeting is available and we can use the same targeting scheme I used for that ad. Since my CPC rate is only 35 US cents per click, I say we have the money from our pre-existing budget to boost at least one message in Armenian for maybe $30 or less.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b9f96cdb66104ab4210570f7ac8c21c80c892ba4.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"484\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-04 04:20:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.661647", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18781, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3388, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Mixing with the Makerfox value network</b>\n\nI guess the most important difference is this: if the collaboration is priced high it is more difficult for the Makerfox algorithm to do a network barter involving, say, my broken phone, because it takes 20 phones to balance one ticket.\u00a0\n\nOther than that, Matt, it's just inflation: the ticket costs 1000 EUR, but day of work from a person in the community comes down to 500.

We have come up with three questions:\n\nThe mother-child code relationship. Say, we code \u201chomosexuality\u201d and it intersects in the coded fragment with the issue of \u201cvarious approaches\u201d. Wojtek codes separately assuming that if we want to get the intersection the software will catch it and display. I code: mother: \u201chomosexuality\u201d and child: \u201chomosexuality: various approaches.\u201d What is your advice?\n\nWojtek observed that if, say, he codes the whole entry with CODE1 and then codes a part of it with CODE2 and then wants to adde CODE3, say, to a word, he cannot do this. The system allows only two codes \u201con one bit of text\u201d, it seems.\n\nThe most urgent issue: is it possible to duplicate a threat of a conversation, so we could code it on the platform separately (also inter-coder reliability) and only then to compare our codes and reconcile them?

It's hard to learn all the necessary tools and skills, so in this project we could help each other along the way. And maybe more importantly, we could make self-supply much more efficient by allowing for specialization and economic exchange within the group. So far I don't know any group doing this across all the categories of self-supply, so I started this.\n\nFor example, I became quite efficient by now in \"producing\" HTC Desire HD phones (assembling them from cheap broken ones, and updating to newest Android 4.4 via <a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.org/\">CyanogenMod 11</a>). This is something I can produce quite efficiently by now \u2013 but even though <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/manual-htc-desire-hd\">I document how to do it</a>, others would need more time to get into this than it makes sense for producing just one of these for themselves. Sounds like a great opportunity for helping each other out (for example, via <a href=\"http://pay.coupons/\">PayCoupons barter exchange</a>). So I will offer two such phones in the next week for barter value here, and more later, and in exchange could use items from others that I can't produce myself efficiently (for example, I'd need a lot of LiIon 18650 batteries, which can be remanufactured from breaking down old notebook accu packs, but it needs some expertise and testing equipment).\n\nMakes sense?

Several of us had been involved in helping out in Calais. We drove it to a refugee camp in Serbia. We gave basic care: massage, footcare, taught stretching to people with bad backs (comes from sleeping rough), things like that.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Georgie]\nMe and Michael work together at a unofficial refugee camp in Serbia. I imagine Calais to have been something like that. There were roughly 1000 refugee boys & men, mostly Afghans, essentially homeless, lived w/op structures & systems, they had nothing. And the network that existed came off the backs of the volunteers that were there...Save the Children, \u2026 UNHCR were there, but we could not see that they were doing anything at all, except prevent people from moving across borders. It was a mess.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Michael]\nWe have a situation that is quite supportive,...in Serbia where the govt is just not there. As we see, look into the future, how do we interact with the 2 different contexts? Comes with hurdles & ?. We came from the mutual perspective that we should be in solidarity with teh people. The people \u2026   The irony is that those who have been through it are doing the most work. For instance, \u2026 How do we support ppl to look after themselves. This is beginning to how to do that, the first type of experiment.\n[/quote]\n\n_**Q: What did you do?**_\n\nFootcare..bunions & ppl with scabies, problems with people who were sleeping rough. \n\n[quote=Georgie]\nRun mostly by two nurses. Change their socks...\nWe don\u2019t think much about footcare, it\u2019s easy for us. But these boys had terrible feet. They had unmatching shoes, they had their shoes stolen from them, they walked 20 km a day,  etc. So they had horrible blisters, they had bad toenails, hygiene problems.  \n\nIt was biblical, I came from a medical background, I\u2019m a junior doctor. These boys were not accustomed to see female Western medical professional kneeling at their feet to wash them! \n\nLanguage was a problem. They spoke Pashtuni, Urdu, & Farsi but we did not. I was exceptionally lucky to work with an American nurse who was Pakistani, and could communicate.\n\nWe did stuff like film screening, to address how to come together. \n[/quote]\n\n_**Q: How was the need determined?**_\n\n A: 7 of us worked in Calais. We had the object before we knew what we were going to build. And asking the persons if they wanted that. \n\n\n[quote=Bernard]\nwhere do you place hygiene in the picture? Would you start with that?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Michael]\nWe had no sewers! Hygiene starts with the engineering, and that was not there. It would really have helped.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Georgie]\nAfter 3 months, I felt most helpful by giving information, yes there is a health care need but that\u2019s not what the people really wanted, thinking about the root cause the whole time. You have to be ready to evolve \n\nThe delivery of care is not easy, but it\u2019s clear. But as we did it, we found that our work was directly caused by some other unmet need, like in Michael\u2019s example if sewers plumbing. Well, of course, there are deep reasons why these people were emigrating in the first place. \n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Michael]\nThey\u2019re already vulnerable to for example, to a hard winter, because they\u2019re already oppressed. Also how do you make the connections to have the people empower themselves?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Alberto]\nWhat I\u2019m learning here, is that healthcare problems are themselves caused by other, deeper problems. Does this mean that emergency mutual aid is pointless, and you don\u2019t recommend getting into it?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Michael]\nNo, not at all. The trailer is still on the road, and it will continue. For the future, I want to do first aid training with migrants to get lots of first aid kits to migrants. I\u2019m sure that once I do that, there will something else\n[/quote]\n\n_**Q: What is the status, do the migrants want to go home?**_\n\n**Intros**\n\n[quote=Alberto]\nI\u2019m interested in how to rig up on-the fly organizations. There is sociological literature about great self-organised services that arise as a response to calamities like earthquakes and floods. I hope to learn about how to do that. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Tory]\nI have a background in public health. I am from Oakland, California, and I am wondering about taking care of our large homeless population. Right now we are struggling with large fires, and they affect unhomed communities. We had to find a way to respond rapidly to meet their needs.  \n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Alex]\nI spent the last few \u2026 living and working on the Calais camps. I also work with a UK organization. The question of how we connect grassroots together better and deeper\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Bernard]\nI am a nurse by training, now moving on to caring about the community at large in the West of Ireland. Also active in the Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture operations. I am hoping to get the information I am already getting.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Chris]\nThough not a lawyer neither an accountant, I know about law and accounting. The UK government  asked me to be a researcher and to think about the unthinkable, like, what happened before companies existing. Resilience comes from the bottom up. And resources, keeping the lights on, and human resilience. I view human arrangements as agreements: companies, governments, armies, rock bands all are agreements. I\u2019m interested in what agreements, what instruments can we mobilize to do what we need to do? My experience is that it is achievable.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Claire]\nWe live in ZAD (Zone \u00c0 Defendre), an autonomous community living together on a big stretch of land outside Paris. I\u2019m very interested in \u2026 I\u2019m interested in building a practical infrastructure in order to build solidarity in our group. But I\u2019m also interested in the struggles around other groups. For example, growing vegetables for other communities, and others who need it, to be a place that welcomes different types of people. And also I\u2019m part of the medic team at ZAD. I\u2019m learning skills , first aid & medical skills in order to help the ppl around. To help ppl who are victims of police violence, and I\u2019m very interested in sharting this knowledge. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Lilli]\nI am also from ZAD. I\u2019m an herbalist, so I also do herbal consultations. We are engaged in bottom up medical care there. We have a medical group that runs this particular show. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Sara]\nI am also from ZAD. We are not specialists, but we do have to deal with lots of issues. We are here to share experiences; larger projects, but also smaller tools. We need this, because our way of organising implies that we sometimes find ourselves isolated. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Tori]\nI\u2019m Tori and I\u2019m part of of a collective...how power affects our health. I have a background in autonomous organization .., more relevant to this conversation, I did solidarity work in Athens? With this work, oftentimes, there is a situation that as an individual, we have to confront very different belief systems, and we can encounter violence. How do you resolve some of the things on the fly?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Gehan]\nI\u2019m Gehan, I don\u2019t bring any technical expertise, how do we practice mutual aid in emergency situations, how do we create an infrastructure in these situations would be v interesting to explore\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Georgie]\nI came here to talk about our work in Serbia. I came here to learn. I felt frustrated about the global situation and wanted to take part in the collective action. Any knowledge is good.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Mitchell]\nI don\u2019t have that much experience, but have been trained as a street medic. I\u2019m interested in building digital tools for this purpose. \nHow to know ethically is.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Alex]\nThere\u2019s a lot of soul-searching about the refugee crisis at the moment. You guys actually went out and deployed, this is great.\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Tory]\nHow do you get out there? How do you reach out in order to make things move onthe ground?\n[/quote]\n[quote=Georgie]\nIt\u2019s all about networks. I did everything through Facebook! Even got to Serbia because of something I read on Facebook. \n[/quote]\n[quote=Michael]\nYou don\u2019t need to break the law, but it\u2019s important to cut through the bureaucracy. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Claire]\nI used to think that the public was a mass of people waiting for our help. But then I started squatting, and got around to asking local people \u201cwhat do you need?\u201d and this worked better. Also, it turns out local people have capacity. And I wonder if it would be possible to mobilise that capacity, and how.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Gehan]\nSystem change is long term. It\u2019s easy to get demotivated from. This kind of work, I think, is where new systems get met. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Tory]\nProposal. Let\u2019s discuss what to do with emergency mutual aid when you have met the basic need. Do you scale and do the same thing elsewhere? Do you stay and diversify, doing more things in the same place?\n[/quote]", "created_at": "2017-10-25 16:07:30.839154", "updated_at": "2017-11-04 22:32:57.857100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1639, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 127.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3543, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3510, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The Futures Knowlab is happy to host a broad conversation on the ways ahead in foresight in collaboration with Edgeryders.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">In our experience, nothing happens until people talk to each other and are generous with their thoughts.

I know <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a> will be documenting sessions, perhaps she's interested in helping with the planning aspect.\n\nI do plan to teach some informal git sessions in Matera. I'm no expert, but they will basically be aimed at showing others how to update the current unMonastery website - which will be applicable to anyone interested in using git pages for free hosting of static pages.\n\nI ran into <a href=\"/u/sammuirhead\">@SamMuirhead</a> yesterday, and he mentioned at the Open Hardware Summit, at the end of every session they had a list of questions to summarize it - the main points, the further actionables. He can perhaps give greater detail. I think it would be a good idea to have, say, 10 minutes built-in to the end of sessions for people to go over such questions.\n\nI also think it's important to capture thoughts in somewhat less institutional language - I tend to bring a notebook with me and after talks, films, give it a few minutes to write what stuck with me. This could be encouraged by public hackpads for sessions - so that people can work simultaneously - that are then brought to the platform. As well as perhaps \"note boxes\" at the end of every session for people to drop pages into. This could risk being illegible, but I find other means, like post-its, often do not portray the full depth of conversation for those not present.\n\nAs far as stewarding the data and documentation, I assume most of it ends up on the ER servers. Perhaps installing ownCloud, which can then mount external cloud storage across other platforms, giving one point of access.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-10 08:41:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.383699", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 326, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38739, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7563, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-25 16:08:33.167043", "updated_at": "2017-10-25 16:08:33.167043", "deleted_at": "2017-10-25 19:23:13.596084", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81372, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 93, "raw": "Translations too, for sure! :)", "created_at": "2020-08-05 07:45:22.354528", "updated_at": "2020-08-05 07:45:22.354528", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81361], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80207, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 44, "raw": "I cannot, unfortunately, suggested a day earlier above", "created_at": "2020-07-09 21:09:12.210988", "updated_at": "2020-07-09 21:09:12.210988", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80206], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81464, "user_id": 6637, "topic_id": 14202, "post_number": 11, "raw": "**First Question** <br /> dsasasd <br /><br /> **Second Question** <br /> sada <br /><br /> **Third Question** <br /> option 1 <br /><br /> **Fourth Question** <br /> option 3 <br /><br /> **Fifth Question** <br />  <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-08-06 16:55:34.982550", "updated_at": "2020-08-06 16:55:34.982550", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42081, "user_id": 355, "topic_id": 4503, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Take a look:\n\nhttp://www.romaniapozitiva.ro/bucuresti/call-for-the-international-futurespotters-workshop-on-july-9-10/", "created_at": "2018-02-26 09:04:00", "updated_at": "2018-02-26 09:06:46.498521", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [4536], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28416, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4686, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Making acquaintances</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/catalina\">@Catalina</a>,\u00a0meet <a href=\"/u/razvanzamfira\">@RazvanZamfira</a>, also in a video above!\n\nRazvan, Catalina and I came across the<a href=\"http://www.culturalfoundation.eu/idea-camp/\"> Idea Camp </a>funded by the European Cultural Foundation and I recognised your face :) Did you guys win the challenge?

Former US president Barack Obama told a livestream town hall held by My Brother\u2019s Keeper alliance at the start of June that \u201ca far more representative cross-section\u201d of society has joined the current race protests compared to others in recent history.\n\nAcross Europe, countries have been confronting imbalanced systems that exacerbate privilege, power and oppression.\n\nThis week one of our members wrote a post highlighting how members of the community can support the deconstruction of the system of racial injustice and police brutality in the US [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794).\n\nAt a time when the world is challenging the inequality that underpins our societies, EdgeRyders\u2019 community has been discussing how we can reform and build new structures free of inequality.\n\nDecentralisation of power is one way of creating a fairer system, and one of our members started a conversation this week on how decentralised technologies can be created more effectively. [Take a look](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-do-decentralization-research-findings-7-maxims/13822) here.\n\nWe have also been looking at ways to build alternative systems to ones that profit from our need to connect. To move away from commercial social media channels, we have set up a telegram channel and would like to further develop our chatbot Alice for optimal user experience. If you think you\u2019ve got what it takes then have a look [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lets-talk-about-alice-and-how-to-have-a-good-conversation-with-and-edgeryders-chat-bot/13842).\n\nOne of our members attended a United Nations panel on the future of internet governance, a proposed structure that needs critical feedback. [Join in](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818) the conversation here, if you have thoughts on how it could be structured.\n\nSpeaking about building things, a community member is looking for a [senior developer](https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-friendly-edtech-startup-you/13853) to fill a technical leadership role at an edtech startup.\n\nFinally, we are still in the process of creating an informative and engaging programme for our Livelihood summit in September and October. Our next listening session takes place on 22nd June and [brings together knowledge](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414) from higher education policy makers and workers, unions and human rights defenders to discuss the possibilities of making a living after years of study.\n\nIn case you missed it \n\nOn Tuesday June 16th we are holding a Zoom meeting [to discuss](https://edgeryders.eu/t/june-16-resilient-livelihoods-and-behavioural-adaptation-to-covid/13867) what we can learn from the Messina district in Sicily. The area has 120 enterprises that in the last decade have worked together to built a human-centric economy, bringing stability and prosperity to an area of high unemployment. \n\n\nHave a thoughtful weekend. \n<br>\n<hr>\n*Video art: Structure: A Microscopic Landscape in 4k by Drew Garaci*", "created_at": "2020-06-12 10:52:44.134450", "updated_at": "2020-06-26 09:01:02.074362", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 576, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 112.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38742, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7205, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-25 16:47:10.274026", "updated_at": "2017-10-25 16:50:08.316901", "deleted_at": "2017-10-26 17:02:10.759434", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38743, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7563, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-25 16:50:18.421172", "updated_at": "2017-10-25 16:50:18.421172", "deleted_at": "2017-10-25 19:23:14.638740", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7262, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3555, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Making Sessions appear on the Program page</b>\n\nAll sessions proposed for Lote4 will automatically appear on the <a href=\"/program\">Program page</a> if in the bottom of the editing page where one creates a session, next to: Behaviors the text \"lote4-session\" is added.\n\nIf this is not done by the user creating the session, it can be done later by content managers or site admins.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-05 13:08:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.705453", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 76, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2386, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2353, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The unMonastery Matera prototype\u00a0has been submitted for the CheFare Italian competition, and last week it became one of the 40 projects\u00a0shortlisted for the next phase of the competition!!\u00a0More info about this phase <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/we-are-shortlisted\">here</a>.\n\nTo increase our chances of winning, we need to collect as many votes as possible in the upcoming two months, not just from Italians but also from\u00a0people around the globe.\u00a0The challenge is to drive participation across a number of channels and across diverse communities, including Edgeryders, the people of Matera, and fellow change makers, supporters of radical innovation or\u00a0residents in the unMonastery.\u00a0\n\nBy outlining\u00a0how a successful campaign would look like, it would be great if we can provide answers to the following :\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>What is a powerful, creative message to prompt people to go on the CheFare website and cast a vote?

When I say that \"it all comes down to voting,\" I mean that systematically the way decisions are made is through the voting system. If the voting system is unfair, is bad, is broken, or anything like that, then regardless of the amount of sensible deliberation, the results can be manipulated. Gaming voting systems is a time honored tradition, and designing voting systems such that they are substantially resistent to gaming is a tricky thing. (And, as pointed out by Gibbard and Satterthwaite, if you manage to eliminate the gaming factor, then the system is bound to be either random or dictatorial).\n\nIn that report, I'm really addressing the issue of voting systems, and didn't really get into the other side of the story, which is deliberation. Deliberation should really be the important bit - but it's useless unless the underlying voting system is (mostly) solid.\n\nThere is a concept of deliberative democracy, wherein people engage with each other on a particular subject and try to arrive at consensus about the details of the subject before starting to develop the \"legislative text\" or whatever it is they finally vote on. That's the original idea of parliament, but parliamentary procedure, party politics and pomp have more or less eliminated deliberation from the parliamentary process, and replaced it with discord.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-14 23:39:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.169871", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25837, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3588, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>... if not, we'll accept it.</b>\n\nPersonal emails was my first suggestion, and I think it is the way to go.

I think you sould define the objectives more clearly.\n\nSo, do you want total energy yield? Then no need for double orientation, just pointing south (if you are in the north hemisfere, and around 30 degrees tilted. Typical and easy.\n\nDo you want a nice steady output along the day? Then because of panels getting 15% cheaper each year, or more, the thing could just be to have twice as many panels and have half looking to the morning sun and half at the evening sun. Tracking could still make sense I guess.\n\nThat said, I must admit I am a solar tracker fan. And in my professional time in Spain working with PV I designed many trackers on paper. Many is around 50!!!\n\nOne of the main criteria when you do a tracker is wind resistance. More about that later.\n\nAnd I guess you are aiming at simplicity here.\n\nSo my recomendation is a one axis tracker but with a polar axis.\n\nThis type: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nellis_AFB_Solar_panels.jpg\n\nMade by a large company with a cheap and very deployable. It is my favourite.\n\nCheck of course the wikipedia article on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_tracker\n\nThen for the movement I would do a mechanical system that does not get broken with wind blows. A good option there is to move the panels by the motor relocating a hanging weight, and then a damper.\n\nMy last year engineering project, in spanish, has a comparison on solar tracker models. More on that later.\n\nI live in Berlin, met Pavlik recently here. Dont know exactly how we could collaborate.

Note, people who share will not necessarily click themselves before sharing (I often don't, maybe I know the content already, or I think it interests my readers more than myself ...).\n\nBut I see your point: these stats are still a low ROI for your time. I blame it on the \"screamy\" social media culture, which is only getting worse: it's all about \"sharing\", and so much is shared that people hardly read it any more. Twitter, to me, is the paradigmatic example: I can't stand its stream of disconnected \"news\", with no proper filters to only see what I want, so I don't look at my Twitter feed at all these days and just use it as a bookmarking tool for links I want to remember, and quotes I like \u2026 not caring that there are \"followers\" who might get these in their feeds, but if they do, I expect them to not read them mostly, just like me, and my weekly Twitter stats prove it. To me, social media culture is really dysfunctional since 2-3 years: now where everyone wants their own stuff to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uT3SBzmDxGk\">go viral</a>, the resulting noise is just drowning it all.\n\nIf we agree here, maybe it's time to explore other media routes with Edgeryders.

Reducing the graph\n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:137, topic:13988\"]\nWe need to reduce the number of general categories and make sure that they help us address the central concern of POPREBEL: what are the cultural/cognitive maps people carry in their heads that are providing a \u201cbackground\u201d for their choices, also political?\n[/quote]\n\nAs I see it, SSNA \u2013 a qual-quant method \u2013 comes with native support for some reduction techniques, which are \"a natural\" because they are technically easy and theoretically grounded. \n\nI refer, of course, to graph reduction based on network structure. The idea is:\n\n1. build the codes co-occurrence graph.\n2. apply reduction methods from graph theory.\n\nThe current iteration of Graphryder only supports the easiest and most intuitive of these methods: a frequency count. It amounts to filtering a graph by the value of a parameter *k*, the number of times two codes co-occur. It works very well, because empirically you can reduce the number of codes by ~ 90% by increasing the value of *k* from 1 to 2. However, I can manually reduce the graph in other ways (see below).\n\nThe theoretical grounding rests on an argument made on two parts.\n\n1. The (full) codes co-occurrence graph is an artifact of collective intelligence: it encodes the voice of the community. \n2. Reducing it is sometimes a necessary evil, to overcome limits in human cognition. When reducing, however, we should apply a method that filters in the most \"important\" *edges* (not so much the most important nodes, since we optimized SSNA on finding connections). Since we are dealing with graph math, \"important\" normally refers to how much an edge contributes to defining the overall structure of the graph. There are more sophisticated ways to determine \"importance\" than frequency counts, for example Simmelian backbone or normalized degree; I am not sure their result is worth the extra effort, but maybe I could attempt a small mathematical paper looking for some sort of equivalence. That would be nice, because it would say that, no matter what reduction technique you use, the same codes and their connecting edges always get filtered in.\n\nIt the problem is \"too many codes\", I see no need to create an alternative layer of codes. I would be rather more interested in reducing the number of codes algorithmically (\"keep the most important *dyads* of codes\"), and then allocating my capacity to interpreting the reduced graph. This has also the advantage that it is fine-tunable: you can always reduce the graph further by increasing the value of the parameter *k*. \n\n### 2. Argument mapping\n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:137, topic:13988\"]\nWhat emerges is the project\u2019s \u201cgrammar.\u201d For example, we can construct the following sentence: John, who is a teacher [actor type] writes about a lack of clean water in his appartment complex [situation] and decided to form a group [type of action] and follow his belief in the need to help people [ideology], particularly in his town [place/location].\n[/quote]\n\nAre you familiar with the literature on argument mapping? This is an idea that emerged in computer science after 2000. Basically, a statement would be classified according to its role in the argument. For example, if Alice says \"the use of face masks helps prevent the spread of viruses\", she is making a *claim*. If Bob adds \"indeed, more widespread mask use happens in countries less affected by the virus\", he is adding a piece of *evidence in favour* of Alice's claim. Carol could then add \"this is only true of non-airborne viruses\", she is adding a *limitation* to the claim. And so on. This is attractive to CS folks, because of course you can connect statements in a large debate in a graph (again), and then manipulate the graph. \n\nI am under the impression that argument mapping went nowhere and was abandoned, but I might be wrong. I do know researchers that used to be very into it and could involve them, if you are interested.", "created_at": "2020-09-22 11:16:07.730054", "updated_at": "2020-09-22 11:16:07.730054", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 705, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [83120], "is_reply_to": [83120], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88267, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14780, "post_number": 14, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:13, topic:14780\"]\nMy preference would be to work in both 2 and 3 as a bridge - being a techy on the ethno-team and an ethno-aware member of the tech team.

I have not made up my opinion about this ... but to get a feeling about how widespread \"organized\" sharing and collaborative economy is in Matera, I looked at some numbers to compare it with cities I know or have lived for some time:\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Matera, Italy (60k)</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Fuengirola, Spain (70k)</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Gie\u00dfen, Germany (70k)</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Bari, Italy (320k)</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Bielefeld, Germany (320k)</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.couchsurfing.org/\">CouchSurfing</a> hosts</th>\n\n<td>98</td>\n\n<td>95</td>\n\n<td>892</td>\n\n<td>900</td>\n\n<td>1290</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\">AirBnB</a> hosts</th>\n\n<td>70</td>\n\n<td>432</td>\n\n<td>38</td>\n\n<td>142</td>\n\n<td>33</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\nNote that the extraordinarily high number of CouchSurfing hosts in Gie\u00dfen is easily explained: the Gie\u00dfen is a city awash with students (about 25-30 000 out of 70 000 people). Given that context, Matera is not doing bad. It's slightly better than for Fuengirola, Spain (71 000 people and 95 profiles). On the other hand, there are 70 <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\">AirBnB</a> offers in Matera but only 38 in Gie\u00dfen. Of course Matera is a much more touristic place than Gie\u00dfen, so again not a fair comparison. The other comparison (with Fuengirola, an <em>extremely</em> touristic place) is also not fair.\n\nThese numbers might not tell much. For example, the AirBnB numbers for Bari are so low (inspute of being a touristic place) that I gues there is probably some other room-sharing platform that is used more in Basilicata? But if there's any preliminary conclusion to make, then maybe that Basilicata is a bit behind when it comes to the diffusion of web-based sharing economy services, but still has really substantial numbers. And I guess that, except for the resource-poor but Internet-savvy young generation, sharing economy is still a fringe science :P Which means, even where it works well, the user base will be not much above 1% of the population. And it still works. Means it's enough to find <em>some </em>in an area for a functional sharing economy. Others may join later once they get accustomed to the Internet and what their friends are doing with it ... that takes indeed a good amount of time, so I think you're right when speaking about the \"digital divide\" as a hindering factor for the sharing economy in Southern Italy ...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-18 22:58:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.040773", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 464, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27930], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24448, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2582, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>feedback</b>\n\nSam this is great planning work, very comprehensive!\u00a0<span>To your questions:</span>\n\n2.

They are not directly related to the \"magic COVID app\", but they do resonate with some of the arguments we explored in this event. \n\n### 1. Restricted freedoms in Asia-Pacific\n\nEarlier this week, the Open Government Partnership held [this meeting](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/events/open-response-open-recovery-inclusive-participation-and-civic-space-in-times-of-crisis/). They found robust evidence that states inclined towards authoritarianism exploited the pandemic to increase surveillance and restricts liberties. Most countries in the region are also restricting the publication of data on the pandemic itself, presumably so that they control the narrative and keep their nations in a perpetual state of fear. Authoritarians love fear, because it makes government overreach more acceptable. \n\nI am not convinced that this is only an Asian phenomenon. In my own native Italy, 19 regions out of 20 refuse to publish open data on COVID-19 ([thoughtful post by Matteo Brunati]\n(http://www.dagoneye.it/blog/2020/06/18/governo-non-aperto-serve-spinta-open-government/), in Italian). \n![image|370x227](upload://j2EfXJhOyl3MiFg2Qy4EkPNEUve.png) \n\n### 2. Smart city infrastructure re-deployed to counter-demonstration surveillance in the USA\n\nThe city of San Diego, in progressive California, has 4,000 smart traffic lights. Which have cameras. Which store their footage on some server farm. Turns out [San Diego police are now accessing that footage](https://distincttoday.net/2020/07/01/san-diego-police-accessed-smart-streetlights-camera-footage-to-spy-on-black-lives-matter-protests/) in search of material to incriminate Black Lives Matter protestors. The whole thing [had been predicted](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/smart-cities-surveillance-and-new-streetlights-san-jose) by the EFF in 2017, and this lends some strength to slippery slope-type arguments whenever someone wants more monitoring and more data on the spaces where humans live. \n\nWe are still very far from a bottom line on the consequences of SARS-COV-2 on the Internet and how humans use it.

Opening up this information could be useful for all of us. Feeling part of your local area and knowing what happens there is really good for your &amp;nbsp;wellbeing and health. Often, people would like to be more involved locally, but find it hard to find out what is going on in their area.\n\nVarious projects have tried to find the best ways of compiling information about local community groups and activities, but none are truly able to provide a full and up-to-date picture. One way of doing this is speaking to the people involved, directly. This can be a very good way of doing this, because when you ask people to tell you what is great about their local area, you collect information that is rich in context and meaning, and that paints a vibrant picture of the areas they live in. However, approaches that rely on speaking to people can be expensive, and the information they collect is soon out of date.\n\nOther ways of collecting information about local areas involve online or automatable ways of finding out this information. However, doing automatised research online, often means that researchers are unsure about the real meaning of the data that they are collecting: is someone tweeting about a local yoga group because they love it, or because they hate it? Further, solely relying on online data means that we run the risk of missing out on the lived experiences of those people who are not online, or who do not share much information about their lives online.\n\nThis session is to pool our knowledge of what has worked and what has not worked, internationally, and to scope out the possibility of building something that does.\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\nDate: 2014-10-25 10:30:00 - 2014-10-25 10:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2014-09-24 23:01:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.177925", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 333, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 1457], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3710, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3677, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7c477530ff87440ce522d238da5c9bb7aee8e162.jpg\" width=\"358\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nThe reason why Living On The Edge happens every year is because nothing comes close to having conversations sitting in front of each other instead of our screens, sharing the work and challenges, asking for advice from some of the smartest peers you'll meet.

A few months ago, I went to the LOFT COWORKING BRUSSELS, a brand new coworking space in Forest, Brussels area, just to have a look on the facilities there, eventually to become a regular visitor tasting coffee for free. After a few days there, having a good feeling with the owner- animator, a smart and open-minded guy named Bernard, I proposed to help the launching phase with a sketched chronicle of my own, about the daily and time-to-time activities of the first attendants at The Loft. Including myself as the jack-in-the-box with round glasses and no hair, who doesn't know much about coworking (\"organized promiscuity\", said Massimo, see below), but a lot about cocooning, conspiring, costarring, consterning, colearning, cojoking, cosquatting, cocogirls... and cocommunication, of cocourse. \u00a0\n\nSo I named it The Cocoworkers and started to feed FaceBook Bernard the blogger with my yellow postIt-like sketches, that I regularly produce with great fun.\n\nWell, it's gently growing from one week to the others, eventually becoming a collector for outsiders and fans from other coworking spaces (like Massimo in Italy, Leslie in Marseille or Marco in Maastricht). Could become a successful postcards serie if more Edgeryders like them on The Loft Facebook fan page...^^J<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/coco09021201_toutseul.jpeg\" title=\"\">\n\n<a href=\"http://coworkingbrussels.com/\">http://coworkingbrussels.com/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vebi.be/Visites-Virtuelles/TheLoft/The-Loft-360.html\">http://www.vebi.be/Visites-Virtuelles/TheLoft/The-Loft-360.html</a>\n\n<strong style=\"border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; \">The LOFT \u2013 Coworking Brussels est un espace de bureau partag\u00e9 et de salles de r\u00e9union, offrant des solutions flexibles aux ind\u00e9penda</strong><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; font-style: inherit; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; \">nts, entrepreneurs et TPE.\u00a0</strong>En plus d\u2019\u00eatre un espace de coworking, le LOFT a vocation d\u2019\u00eatre un carrefour de comp\u00e9tences et de networking o\u00f9 les relations se cr\u00e9ent et la collaboration prend forme.\n\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/coco10021205_massimocowo.jpeg\" title=\"\">\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 01:00:14", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:14:46.417104", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 595, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9711, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 2998, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Thank you Maria!!!</b>\n\nRight away I would like to personally recognize <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>'s persistence on experimenting with process she considered more open and participatory.

About the costs, it will not cost Edgeryders any money to be part of this test, and just like for all other future users of Economy App, transactions will be charged with a commission fee of 7% <em>in barter value</em>, not in money.

The project is a structured effort to listen to the voices of people on the ground, providing a breakdown of populism that encodes the point of view of the people directly affected by it, both supporters and opposers.\n\n## The Ethnographic Study\n\nEdgeryders is seeking three ethnographers, one in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany (the Eastern Bundesl\u00e4nder), to each conduct a three month ethnographic study (a 'mini ethnography'), potentially extendable to six months, on the impacts of COVID-19 and what they can tell us about the rise of Populism in Europe. We would like the mini-ethnography to address COVID-19's effects upon one or more of the following topics:\n\n* **Housing and Work** \u2014 exploring intergenerational relations and gender via work patterns, education, leisure time, and divisions of labour. How COVID-19 is requiring people to (re)negotiate these relations and responsibilities and/or brings existing disparities to light (e.g. childcare duties falling upon women).\n* **Healthcare** \u2014 access and inequality, reflections on the system and its relation to politics.\n* **Who is to blame for social and political problems?** \u2014 examining **anti-LGBT** sentiment and relationship to **ethnic minorities and refugees** e.g. scapegoating. Another possible approach to this topic is the study of **anti-intellectualism**  \u2014 particularly in the COVID setting, around relationships to COVID information and personal privacy (e.g. do people feel it a government or elite power play or a legitimate public health issue).\n\nThe study will seek to connect these issues to participants\u2019 political choices and ideologies, engaging a diverse range of participants (particularly those outside of large cities and in the university-aged and educated demographic). We theorise that people\u2019s responses to COVID-19 \u2014 its effects on existing systems and practices, what it tells us about those systems and practices in the first place, and the way they frame those politically \u2014 will shed light on the \u2018shadow of populism\u2019 in each country. \n\nThis is a part-time role and would especially suit a postgraduate student in anthropology or a related field, as there will also be opportunities for publication of research results. All of the data generated is open access, so you are welcome to use it for your own work. If you are a Masters student, this could form the basis of your dissertation study. If a PhD, it could be part of a dissertation study or the basis for publications.\n\n## The Role\n\n* Conducting a 3 month ethnography on one or more of the above topics, in large part online.\n* Engaging participants to discuss their thoughts on the online platform, conversing with them and asking them deep ethnographic questions about their experiences and daily lives.\n* Regularly posting field notes, interviews, and reflections on ethnographic findings on the platform.\n* Inventing new and creative ways of doing digital ethnography on issues like populism.\n* Working with a team of ethnographers who will be a) conducting ethnographic research on the same topic at the same time in a different field site and b) who will be coding the ethnographic materials and conversations you create on platform.\n* Working with community managers and the outreach/engagement team to plan other events to engage participants (including presenting your own research!)\n\n## The Ideal Candidate\n\n* Has experience conducting both offline and online/digital ethnography.\n* Is trained in the theory and practice of ethnography.\n* Speaks fluent English and either Polish, Czech or German (we will be conducting one ethnographic study in each country).\n* Is used to working in teams and generating comparative ethnographic analysis.\n\n## Salary\nThe salary for the position is 3,000 Euros for 3 months part time.\n\n## Application Process\nTo apply for the Poland ethnographer position, please send a CV and short research proposal (1-2 pages)  to [amelia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:amelia@edgeryders.eu) and [j.kubik@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:j.kubik@ucl.ac.uk)\n\nTo apply for the Czech ethnographer position, please send a CV and short research proposal (1-2 pages) to [amelia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:amelia@edgeryders.eu) and jiri.kocian@fsv.cuni.cz\n\nTo apply for the German ethnographer position, please send a CV and short research proposal (1-2 pages) to [amelia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:amelia@edgeryders.eu) and r.mole@ucl.ac.uk\n\nDeadline: We are reviewing on a rolling basis and are conducting interviews as applications come in until we fill the position, so sooner is better.", "created_at": "2020-10-19 09:26:33.490358", "updated_at": "2020-11-20 11:04:57.192137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 773, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 373.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7136, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3736, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Great guy, great ideas</b>\n\nI too had the pleasure of meeting Mikhail while in Minsk.

I research the effects of language requirements on refugees and migrants in Germany - specifically the ways in which language-integration programmes (which most newcomers are required to complete) impact their socioeconomic (im)mobility. I have found that while these programmes promise a fast and sustainable route for newcomers to participate in the German economy/society, they in practice significantly *delay* their mobility and inclusion. Because of this slowing effect, newcomers to Germany experience long periods of waiting, boredom and temporal uncertainty. During the first wave of the pandemic, Germany shifted its language integration courses online through a state-funded, e-learning platform. There was a great deal of optimism at the time around how these programmes might actually make things much easier for newcomers: giving them more flexibility to schedule their work and learning, and accommodating to a range of different learning preferences and abilities. However, [I found that](https://www.diggitmagazine.com/papers/migrant-language-covid-19) for my informants, shifting to e-learning significantly amplified their sense of uncertainty and stuckness: they felt overwhelmed by the platforms and didn't feel they could navigate the course content without the in-person dynamics of being in a classroom. Above all, it was unclear whether the online exercises counted toward their overall course attendance and if they could finish the course online at all. Though there is so much optimism around e-learning, particularly due to the pandemic, I wonder how much of it is more about bridging the *time between*  rather than expanding and improving existing methods of learning. @Bohjort have you encountered any similar affective/psychological impacts (e.g. feelings of stuckness, impatience, boredom)?", "created_at": "2020-12-09 18:13:53.532629", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 18:13:53.532629", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 279, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 62.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88745], "is_liked_by": [4934, 6859, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9088, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1188, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi Noemi,\u00a0\n\nI think rather than sending out a message with lots of text it would be nice to just\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>share a status update containing a\u00a0picture with some text in it and a link to where people can join the event.

Like a local exchange/trading system (LETS), or a network such as Edgeryders. Key elements that blockchain provides is a distributed nature, a public ledger, and a permanent ledger. Yet in practice, as shown in the Bitcoin network, ultimately because of the computing resources needed to validate the distributed ledger, centralisations occurs (e.g. on a handful of Chinese computing clusters). For me the key to agency, to power of action is that tools should be controllable at the level of use. So if a group uses e.g. blockchain that blockchain should be run by the group using it. Otherwise your specific usecase might be corrupted, made impossible or hindered by the more generic use forms surrounding it.\n\nWas reading this explanation of blockchain the other day, which made me think about blockchain in the Edgeryders case. On how to recognize contributions towards a project before it becomes part of a transactional stage (like when it becomes an undertaking of the company) yet after it has left the realm of occasional contributions.\nThe article was [A Letter to Jamie Diron](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80)\n\nIt posits blockchain as simply a way to create distributed software tools. And adds that this is usually cumbersome (in terms of effectiveness and efficiency) compared to more centralized tools, or where a middle man has a role. Except when that distributedness is what you need to be able to do something at all, because you are otherwise locked out or because otherwise you are hindered to do it well. That is the case for the type of network that Edgeryders forms. But also e.g. LETS.\n\nSo I was wondering about how to translate some aspects of a network like Edgeryders or something simpler like a LETS to a blockchain setting. \nOne is how to deal with negative accounts. In a LETS most 'tokens' come into circulation simply by having a transaction. You and I both have nothing. You do something for me, and I reward you with some tokens. Now I have -x you have +x, and we have brought x in circulation. \n\nMining in a blockchain is a reward (in tokens) for doing the calculations needed to verify the ledger. It is artificially made ever harder, needing ever more effort, to get a reward. This is meant as a way of ensuring loyalty, as it creates real costs. In a LETS or other defined network such as Edgeryders such effort doesn't need to be made ever harder to maintain loyalty, as there is a real net of social  relationships existing that can be the carrier of such loyalty. So one could imagine all members of a LETS or network contributing computing power needed for the consensus about the ledger. With lower powered nodes doing the computing (e.g. a Raspberry Pi sitting next to your router). Running a small node could be seen as your membership-fees of sorts.\n\nQuestions resulting:\n\nWhat are viable ways to deploy blockchain for a 'defined user group' e.g. Edgeryders without relying on infrastructure run by others / globally (e.g. Ethereum)\n\nAre negative wallets possible in a blockchain, or made to be possible? \n\nIs there a way to strip out the 'forced' increasing difficulty of consensus building about a ledger (which in Bitcoin is leading to detrimental centralisation of nodes), and have the needed computing power equally distirbuted over all users?\n\nThoughts?", "created_at": "2017-10-26 20:12:09.537526", "updated_at": "2017-10-26 20:12:09.537526", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 588, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 62.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38776, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7569, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"ton, post:1, topic:7569\"]What are viable ways to deploy blockchain for a 'defined user group' e.g. Edgeryders without relying on infrastructure run by others / globally (e.g. Ethereum)[/quote]\n\nRoughly, [proof of stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) (PoS) algorithms for confirming the transactions in a blockchain seem to be the way to go here. They do not require any significant amount of processing power for \"finding\" the next block, instead they require cryptographic proof that blockchain nodes possess currency tokens (\"have a stake in the game\"). The idea is that those who have the currency have an interest to keep the transactions honest, instead of allowing theft, double spending or inflation to occur, all of which would erode the reputation and / or monetary base of the cryptocurrency.\n\n[quote=\"ton, post:1, topic:7569\"]Are negative wallets possible in a blockchain, or made to be possible?[/quote]\n\nI don't see why you couldn't implement negative account balances in your own blockchain \u2013 it's a distributed database and ultimately can be made to store \u2026 anything :slight_smile: In LETS with negative balances, all balances have to level out to zero at all times, which is a nice invariant to be checked by nodes when confirming the next block.\n\nBut note that negative balances (\"debt\") might socially not be the nicest way to express value relationships. Any debt is an asset for the creditor, and you could choose to only show these (positive) values. While not blockchain stuff, we do it like that in [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons): coupons come into circulation only with our circular barter deals, after which everyone holds a positive balance of somebody else's coupons and can redeem them anytime later. The fact that I am in debt if somebody holds _my_ coupons is not prominently shown (only under \"coupons in circulation\", a metric for trustability as a trading partner).\n\n[quote=\"ton, post:1, topic:7569\"]Is there a way to strip out the 'forced' increasing difficulty of consensus building about a ledger (which in Bitcoin is leading to detrimental centralisation of nodes), and have the needed computing power equally distirbuted over all users?[/quote]\n\nIn proof of work algorithms, not that I know of \u2013 easing difficulty would invite the 51% attacks. In proof of stake, there is no forced increase of difficulty, as no large amount of computing power is needed here anyway.\n\nEthereum intends to switch to proof of stake within one year or so, away from their current proof of work implementation for mining. So there are seemingly good reasons for that.

When you code, don't code for \"content\". If a machine could assign the same code as you're assigning, that's a good sign that you need to rethink how you're coding. As an example of this, I'm seeing a lot of invivo codes (where you use the same terminology as the participant) used when the term itself isn't special, rather than thinking about what they mean and finding the right code to describe that meaning, in line with the codes you've used previously if the concept has come up before. See your desire to automatically assign an invivo code as a red flag going forward, and ask yourself if you're using their exact word because it's the word that saliently captures the concept (and the one you've been using thus far to capture that same concept) or because it's the easiest thing to do in the moment. We code for meaning --- what is the point of what this person is trying to say? What are they trying to get across? What values and worldview are they putting forward? \n\nThis means assigning more descriptive codes (like `seeking purpose` or `defining justice` or `building inclusivity`; `access` and `education`; `complexity` and `asking experts`) rather than codes like `limiting` or `involvement`, which have no real meaning.

Depending on who you ask you will get a different response as to what is wrong and what could improve it.\n\nAnother thing is that when you are working in a social environment, <em>fairness</em> becomes quite a relative concept, so is <em>community</em>.\u00a0\n\nFrom the stewards' point of view and assuming you start something with good will and genuine interest to make something better (we don't know if that's true in profit making businesses, but consider the non money making), I see it as an endless set of choices, constraints and ultimately trade-offs. Already \"giving everyone access to a community asset in an organized fashion\" means someone is in the position to give access, whether it's one person, a group, or an entire subset of a community. And position comes with either/or politics and money, which always tend to bring up complex issues and make anyone in the position of stewardship, or their projects, deeply vulnerable.\n\nHope you are well and inspired in your writings,\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-04 09:20:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.399220", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 245, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25276, "user_id": 2306, "topic_id": 3568, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Fun T-Shirts for Edgeryders</b>\n\nHi, Natalia!\n\nIf there 's no other space, it has to be sunday, but, \u00a0as I\u00a0believe having mentioned elsewhere, it is a bit of a wet process and I don't know whether the stuff (Shirts, bags) will dry before everybody wants to travel home.

As there were no doctors and poor health care around. This worked for 6 years, he was supporting and setting up this not the medical person. \nThey had to deliver their own babies. Regenerate the midwifery movement.\n\nThen to Washington DC, collaborated with some doctors to initiate the first bilingual clinic there. \n\nThen Back to California, fixing cars, then went to work at the WELL, and the whole earth catalogue. Supposed to work on customer support and marketing in time I became to \n\nJohn became what is now known as an online community manager. He basically invented the field. He had an intense living-working experience.\n\nIn 1994 John co-founded the first online news website, SFGate. Combine news articles with community dialog. Help journalism be better, help the community be smart. A hybrid of opinions with fact checked professionally written material.\n\n_**What makes the Open Village and The Reef different?**_\n\nDoing online community, living space and working space together is rare. This is authentic pioneering work. This hybrid of virtual and physical community. Not having them be separate entities, but blend seamlessly into each other. Each depend on each other. They need to be connected.\n\nOpen Village is a network of houses with an autonomous network affiliation. The Reef is one of those spaces. The communities need to be shaped by the active participants, yet there are some general things in common.\n\nJohn offers a toolkit to improve our likelihood of success and how to not screw it up.\n\n_It\u2019s all about relationships._ John wanted to make the online experience as meaningful as possible, foster deep relationships, in the online community. Working honestly and compassionately in the open with each other. It had not been proven, but John had a conviction it would work.\n\n_A culture of sharing and respect._ It must express online and offline in word, deed, ??.\nIt has to be clearly evident to everyone who shows up, lives, works, stays. It\u2019s a commitment and has to be corrected if there are deviations.\nYou have to want the togetherness. You need to be committed. Or the ups and downs will get to you.\n\n* **Work hard**\nJohn wasn\u2019t very suited to the community life. But he wanted to be with his community members more than he wanted to remain how he was. He became a hard worker.\n* **Share**\nDon\u2019t let things escalate. Keep it up. Share is a verb, an action, do it, initiate it, don\u2019t wait for someone to do it. It is bad to let things lead to an eruption of conflict.\n\n* **Be Open and Honest**\nTalk about what limits you want to set. Don\u2019t get mad if someone asks what\u2019s going on. \u201cOh, nothing\u201d is not an answer.\n\n* **Provide Service**\nYour attention and effort goes beyond your own job, projects and personal interests. If you see something that needs to be done, you pay attention to it and take the initiative to lead it.\nDon\u2019t be a Complainer, Grouch, Jerk (or worse)\nEveryone has their moods. Do they drive you, or do you drive them? Don\u2019t let them drive you.\nMake Time for Fun\nIf it\u2019s no fun, no group will be working for the long haul.\n\n_The magic of affirmation._ Encourage someone. Finding something you like in another person and lift him up by telling them. Not like a \u2018like\u2019 on Facebook. Show that you\u2019re paying close attention to a person. You can help grow more of that in the other person by expressing it, bringing it out. Never fake it, if you don\u2019t see it, don\u2019t say it. Be honest. Keep it real, don\u2019t overstate it. \u201cI see your better self in yourself, but what you just said or did does not really express it very well\u201d. It\u2019s not about stoking up ego or building self esteem. Not \u201cyou are great\u201d but \u201cwhat you just did or said is great\u201d.\n\n_Living Arrangements, maintenance, sustainability._ You have to make some decisions about how you maintain things and manage yourselves. Take time to have a conversation about it. Find skills, strengths, go into it with an open mind. It might take some time to do it what works well for everyone, but not doing it will lead to problems down the line. You want to put out a clear sense of being positive people that are an asset to the nearby community.\nDecent power, good food, good sanitation. A lot of landlords of pretty lax. Someone needs how to not get shocked or overflow the plumbing. Sanitation can kill your community. One richer community failed due to overflowing toilets.\nGrow strong human connections and commit to those.\n\n_About the money._ No money = no projects, no food, \u2026 Grants do not pay for operations. Sometimes projects net a profit, sometimes not. You need to come up with ways to provide for yourself and this will test the community. Who\u2019s owed, what is owed? What\u2019s on him? You can\u2019t mess this up, or it\u2019s a big hole in your boat. What\u2019s your own money, what\u2019s the group money?\nYou and the group need to decide how the rent will be paid. Are you willing to pool your money and then decide to spend it? John lived without any own money for 12 years.\n\n_The projects that make the money._ Is everyone in the kitchen the chef? How much ownership do you have over projects? Is there commercial potential? Do you know how to read a contract?\nHow would you feel like it\u2019s your job to make money for the group, rather than working on your own ideas and projects? Or is the well-being of the whole group more important for you? Are you willing to set aside your own project for a time? Are you able to set yourself aside for a while, working for the whole? Over the long haul, roles can change and reverse at times. John worked a long time \u2018sacrificing for the whole\u2019, working as a mechanic, maintaining appliances. But then he raised seed money for the clinic. You just never know what\u2019s going to happen. You need to pay attention, be committed, and it may just fall on you to be the catalyst that turns the key.\nCan you think of ways to combine projects? Be more than the sum of the whole.\nLeave your ego at the door.\n\n_Who decides what?_ Will you decide through one person? Consensus? Decide on yourself. Be thorough and not attached to just your own personal desires. Who is good at what? What about chores? Everybody should be involved in basic household work and (the usually more fun) project work. If you see something that needs to be fixed, don\u2019t just walk away: step up.\nThe project leader is not necessarily the leader in the living arrangements (important for working-living situations). Perhaps individuals with natural leadership, but it is not a given that this authority carried over to the home situation. It\u2019s about claiming or granting an authority role.\n\n_Stay healthy._ People living together share a lot of germs. Pay attention to basic hygiene. What if everyone gets the flu?\nJohn has a hepatitis B story. Someone came and cooked, infected everyone. Bad stuff, could barely function.\n\n_Privacy and personal space._ At what point does your personal space spill over to the common? Where do you draw the lines? John lived in a complete transparency, mental nudist community. It served him well as an experience in every community situation afterwards.\n\nDon\u2019t escape into your Phone. Don\u2019t obsess to remove yourself from the group. Or you\u2019ll miss it. Alienation can begin in the tiniest things.\n\n_Visitors*._ You want to convey a business like feeling. There needs to be a reason for someone to hang out longer.\n\n_Living and Working._ The online space. Have physical meetings. Have parties. The people who are not face to face, but are online, still benefit from the bonding that the people who do meet physically have done. Magical! And vice verse. The whole network gets stronger from different relationship building. The online is a good diary, everything is searchable, but the diary needs to be available by serious documentation and linking and structuring.\n\n_Managing online community._ Someone will be main point person, but everyone needs to know how to do this stuff well. There needs to be consistency. Even when there is debate online. Finding commonalities by discussing differences. You want your online self to be close as possible to who you are in person. Not knocking roleplaying; but this is how Edgeryders does it. You can\u2019t be too casual on how you accomplish that. You want your work to be as if your speaking naturally, but you are crafting your words so that it seems like you\u2019re spontaneously communicating. You need to compensate for the loss of that you can\u2019t communicate through words. That takes effort. Make your communication \u2018hyperreal\u2019. Project yourself deliberately. Being real is important, and consciously set out to achieve this to get to a place of deeper connection.\n\n_Model the behavior you want to see in others._ Zen master: the main point is to keep trying. That\u2019s why they call it practice. The online environment is restricted to words, pictures, videos, but there is an emotional subcarrier that goes out together. And they will be received and felt by the people at the other end. Hippies called it the \u2018vibes\u2019. \n\n_Be Someone everybody trusts._ Vouch for people and they will vouch for you. Ultimately trust is the basis for everything functioning. Otherwise everything falls on the ground. Many people who are smart and socially capable, had however not experienced the community feeling, the bigger picture. Yet it is the essential part of coming together. John was the trusted person that initially brought everything together. This was a crucial way that this group of talented people became something they themselves called a community.\n\n###The hats you wear\n* **Leader**\nGive all  a place to talk, meet and collaborate. Yet Edgeryders is not a democracy. Someone is responsible at the end. You have responsibilities as leader\n\n* **Participant**\nYou participate, even as you maintain your leader status. You need to participate well, then you will also lead the group to deeper understanding.\n* **Moderator**\n* **Mediator**\nArguments happen. Usually it resolves without intervention. But when you do intervene, do it without expression of your own opinion.\n\n* **Helpdesk**\nThere will be people who don\u2019t know how to do something. Help them, or they will go away.\n\n* **Librarian**\nYou need to know where things are, link to related material. Help people find out things.\n\n* **Analyst**\nHow many people do you have? How do they participate? How long are they here? Weave them into the story you tell to people who support or fund you.\n\n_The Devil is in the details._ You can\u2019t really multitask in real time. Your brain just does really fast switching, not really multitasking. When you wear multiple hats, you\u2019re going to have to be really good at switching. Full attention here, then quickly somewhere else.\nPeople involved in \u2018visionary\u2019 work, often don\u2019t like admin. Yet it needs to be done well, it can endanger projects. It is pivotal. There can\u2019t be mistakes or the consequences will be big. If you\u2019re good at it, you should step up. Pay attention to the details. Being good at the admin details will net you respect from people who are more business or financially minded.\n\n_Authority versus authoritarian._ Authority is recognized by others and reinforced. Authoritarian is processes and rules that enforce without optimizing for what actually is important for the community. Make sure that, when you grab the wheel, you know what you\u2019ll be doing. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re right all the time, just because you\u2019re the \u201cmanager\u201d. Admitting your mistakes and striving not to repeat them, actually builds more trust you\u2019ll need to do your work.\n\n_IRL (In Real Life)._ In fact it\u2019s all real life. You want to be as close to your real self as you can get. You can to project onto others what you think is the best of yourself. Show that you\u2019re being honest and your intentions are good, that you\u2019re part of something bigger.\n\n_Regarding negativity._ Conflict and negativity are inevitable. Yet it does not need to dominate any group. It is not healthy to suppress unexamined feelings or thoughts if they are unpleasant or inconvenient. Get objective enough about the negative to prevent it from spreading, and to fix it. Not about being fake happy, but separating what you want to say from the emotion you are experiencing that is driving you to say it. Don\u2019t make it worse by projecting the full load of negative feelings you may have: mindfulness. Don\u2019t let it go too far. Everyone knows how it feels to be on the receiving end of a rant. Everyone experiences a bad mood. How do you straighten it out? First: separate informational content from the emotion of it.\n\n_Conflict._ Easy to get in, hard to get out. It applies everywhere, online and offline. It seems like people are calibrated to misunderstand each other. We need to figure out how to rise above it. Good news: conflict can strengthen bonds (as well as weakening it). Your bond is stronger if you know that can resolve it, because you have in the past. It is important to carry this with you. You will always know that you have done this. Do not seek conflict, yet do not avoid it if you have to go there.\n\n_When do you talk about it?_ What is your business, what is someone else\u2019s business and not yours? Sometimes it does work without addressing it. Relationships often have a \u201choneymoon\u201d phase. Where everything is \u201cawesome\u201d. The longer you know someone, the more things you find you don\u2019t actually like that much. You want to avoid a buildup of irritation that becomes to hard to sort out, because you have lost the trail where it got sorted. Can you let it go, or do you need to talk about it? Some people are just not aware that what they do bothers other people, and they don\u2019t mind being told. But you don\u2019t want to be the behavior police, straightening people out. As a default, it\u2019s better to say things than not say them.\n\nAm I the problem, or are you the problem? Ask yourself before you blurt out. Problems in a relationship are never 100% one or the other.\n\n_Receiving feedback can be hard._ Sometimes giving it is even harder. Getting defensive, it\u2019s difficult to have empathy. It\u2019s hard to give this feedback in an open and trusted way You can\u2019t erupt. You need to work on it together? Have compassion for the person who is trying to give that feedback. If both people understand that equation, it will go better.\n\n_Oversupply understanding._ This is central. The art of listening. Cut people some slack. Try to understand where they\u2019re coming from. If they\u2019re having a hard time expressing things. Be diplomatic: the essence of being a diplomat means that if you\u2019re at a table with 9 other people, you\u2019ll talk 10% of the time and the rest you listen.", "created_at": "2017-10-26 23:11:04.645155", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 21:32:17.090277", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2860, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 62.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38806, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 7561, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ok for me, festival wrapup in progress, ethical stuff starting this week, \npaper will be ongoing for the whole of November.", "created_at": "2017-10-27 09:33:06.211645", "updated_at": "2017-10-27 09:33:06.211645", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31254, "user_id": 41, "topic_id": 4206, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Its ( for me ) not only about \"Quiet\" ... </b>\n\nI tend to be Ambiverted, or an Introvert that knows how to be social at specific times.\n\nI realize that for me it all depends on the other person, on their state of mind, their energy, their inner intentional and emotional space, etc\n\nI'll feel straight away if being near a person, let alone interacting with this person , directly or indirectly, exhausts me or not.\n\nIt is often easier for me to be in a larger framework with even more people so that I can freely move around to find and/or interact with people I feel there is the space for me to interact with, or enough people for me not to ( need to ) interact with anyone , do whathever feels good at that point in time, moving wherever it feels good to be.\u00a0 Like in Open Space Technology \"Law of Two Feet\" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Law_of_two_feet )\n\nA lot can be shared or expressed contextually, beyond words.\n\nI like cultures where introverts are accepted and understood.\n\nI like being in Finland.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately I will not be there, but here is an umpcoming gathering in Helsinki :\n\nhttps://learningvillagesveaborg.wordpress.com/\n\nI do not know if introverts will feel comfortable there, but certainly it would be interesting to bring up the subject at such kind of convergence, for future shared living ( temporary ) space creation ?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-17 20:48:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.919089", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 249, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86269, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 14740, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ping @matteo_uguzzoni @sebquack @GotheInstitutAthen!", "created_at": "2020-11-04 11:49:34.407315", "updated_at": "2020-11-04 11:49:34.407315", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 37.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8698, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3883, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Ruminations on the ruminations</b>\n\nFrom the above notes it is not obvious, but most of the time we were talking about the unMonastery. <s>Maybe it is important to point out</s> \u00a0<strong>It seems to me</strong>\u00a0 that in many ways people who were involved in the development of the unMonastery idea but did not participate in the Matera prototype (@Nadia, @Alberto, etc) have identical goals for Edgeryders and unMonastery. <s>This is clear \u00a0</s><strong>This impression is based</strong>\u00a0on the discussion around community.\n\nHowever, Edgeryders is a large online platform of 2000+ members, a network of communities, with no specific commitment to an outside community and with no timeframe. At the same time, unMonastery was a tiny community which had to build functioning relationships within the house in a few days and with Matera in a matter of weeks. For a functioning prototype, very short term goals needed to be formulated and acted upon. These were obviously not the same as the Edgeryders'. Whether the unMonastery model will evolve to deliver the original vision of changing \"how we work and live, forever\", remains to be seen.\n\nThe experiment produced some unexpected results, and these, instead of being a source of conflict and disappointment, need to be discussed. The active cooperation between host community and unMonastery, the culture of listening, and allowing things to evolve (trusting the process), are somewhat alien to the do-ocracy model of the Edgeryders. \u00a0Maybe a process of identifying trends and preparing a model that can react to change, adapt to different environments, solve different problems, and point to several different futures, is more in line with what the first prototype taught us. <strong>In my opinion,</strong> the unMonastery needs to be allowed to find its own way to act in the world, because it is designed to operate in a very different context\u00a0from the Edgeryders community.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-06 22:05:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.365516", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29073, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 693, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Great to read this :)</b>\n\nHey @Franca and @WinniePoncelet thanks for these comments.\n\nWhat you wrote Franca is really great to read, because it is the first time actually having a policy maker understanding so well the principle of an open care system, but also discribing the role a governement has to play in the futur. He is there as a facilitator, giving the right tools to test and later on help scale the bottom up initiatives. In such way the governement becomes a currator, not simply a gatekeeper of the funds, but the person who helps grow the talented projects.\u00a0\n\nWinnie i know what you are discribing, with my years of activism i had\u00a0mostly the same kind of experience \u00a0with policy makers in Brussels.

In fact like what edgeryders does on care, we can create locally on any topic, creating an easy swarm of projects that can become a lever to not wait till policy is written, but to shape what it is going to be without having to play the political game. We are going to do this exercice with the Brussels makers scene through the FabCity platform of Barcelona. Bringing projects towards organisations and spaces and coordinating these spaces to communicate as one about their needs towards politics. In such way that we don't have the proposal from politics: let's just build 170 fablabs for 2020, but that through the swarm of knowledge know what are really the necesities.\u00a0\n\nHope i could contribute to this nice debate;\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-05 15:01:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.940973", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 319, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85702, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 13190, "post_number": 42, "raw": "No worries, thanks", "created_at": "2020-10-23 14:52:40.544736", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 14:52:40.544736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85695], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15570, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3883, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>sorry</b>\n\nHi, @Nadia, I put my opinion in the comment section exactly to be perceived as a comment, not part of the narrative we were talking about yesterday.

Free software, that can be adapted and studied and shared. We used GitLab, Rocket.Chat to work online and discuss, Zotero for the research and Godot which is a videoGame engine, very similar to Unity.\n\n2. Copyfair licensing\nWe used AGPL3 protects the software that is in services, we use hardware from the University of Geneva and CC and P2P production License, the advantage is that it doesn\u2019t enable companies to take your product (not really proved in tribunals).\n\n3. Accessible documentation\nChats for hosting, Wikimedia for databases, inclusion and Open Journal.\n\n4. Research.\nWe tried to do participatory research, having a discussion with people and moving towards, it\u2019s a cycle instead of a line. Personal commitment is the key. And another difference is that when you do medical research you don\u2019t have an ethical commitment, in this case you want to share your results.\n\n5. Contribution System\nEconomic part, we are thinking about creating tokens so you can make decision in the collective, and also the use of data that you collect with our games could be valuable.\n\nThe data are very valuable, that can inform the policy maker, we want to produce a collective common.\n\nProblems that you see for your future?\nOne problem is how to involve more people, and ask them free time, and also we have some struggle with financing our self, right now we accessed research funding but the growing of the project is slow and steady.\n\nDifferent suggestion arrives from the participant:\nA mixed revenue system, imagine solution and games that could be available in the market, like designing a kit that could detect your breath and give you back data about you (also if you don\u2019t have illness), there is a very active movement that is into breathing right now, also yoga and mindfulness.\nUse the jams as a way to improve with big steps your development process (useful also for OpenVillage)\nDesign and commercialize pre-assembled kit available for people that suffer from respiratory disease", "created_at": "2017-10-26 23:15:16.102885", "updated_at": "2017-10-31 23:37:26.977450", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 805, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 51.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6409, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6376, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello,\u00a0\n\nI updated the OpenVillage Fest\u00a0<a href=\"/t/program/6110\">program page</a>.

The very very rough prototype we are using looks like the screenshot below.

And joined a group of people who wanted to come together and live and work together in new ways that makes sense for us, seeking a life of peace, self-sufficiency and care, started by living cheaply and trying to take what we can take from the roads in the US, at the time of war we wanted to be  like messengers for peace, the core group of 250 people started to live together in buses in small groups and tour the country.\n\n_**\u201cWe wanted to be messengers for peace\u201d**_\n\nI found  myself 19 living in a bus with 7 people that I don\u2019t know, we started to know each other, and to start, being in a bus, we had to sit in a circle and talked in everything and developed trust, and then it is simple to sit in the bus and tour the country. That meant deep conversations. It\u2019s where I started experiencing \u201cgoing deep\u201d.\n\nThat \u2018s where I began, then after this experiences, we decided to continue living together, bought land in Tennessee. That was the start of a 12 year that we lived collectively so that I didn\u2019t even have my own money, in a way it was ultimate collaboration: we had to learn everything and how to take care of each other. \n\nWe started to age and have families. We had neither the money nor the desire to go to the hospital for anything that occurred to us. So, we we taught ourselves to deliver our own babies, instead of going to the hospital, and that was a learning by doing. Throughout this, we had to collaborate with professional medical people, because bad things happen, and you can\u2019t always DIY your way around them. A couple of local doctors who liked what we were doing helped us, and paved the way for us to deliver our babies and be self-sufficient, ..\nIf you fast forward some years, our skill levels up and we could try to do good for people besides ourselves. So we founded a nonprofit. I found myself in NYC, in the South Bronx, at the time the poorest place in America. We started a free ambulance service for the people; again, in order to do that, we had to collaborate with local people.\n \nMy point is that here, we set a counter culture of people who are doing good. But, in order for us to fulfil our goals, we had to collaborate with people who belong to the \u201destablishment\u201d and we couldn\u2019t have survived without doing so. \n\nLater on, we moved onto a new project: starting a free, bilingual clinic in Wash DC, the first of this kind. Again, the same thing: we collaborated with a bunch of doctors who could see the problem. We (the hippies) drove the initial fund raising, and provided the administration and structure behind it. The clinic is still working.\n\nAfter this I choose to move on with my family and moved to california, after being there for a few years, offered a job helping with a computer network that I knew nothing about, The WELL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL). It had itself grown out of a very successful countercultural project, called the Whole Earth Catalogue. \u2026 before that I was fixing cars to support my family.  \n\nThis is the mid 1980s the idea of people who use the computer to talk to others in a network was a new thing, I was hired to help it grow and support it, because of where I come from, when I got there the only thing I could do is to apply what I learned, so I made this term \u201conline community\u201d.\n \nI tried to help peple to have a meaningful expericne so they feel they are in a community and stay.Some examples\u2026\n\nOne is that we had the big computer , server, was a big box but slow for what we needed and did not have the money to buy a new one, so everybody who are using the system had interest to improve, it. We made this if people paid in advance for the subscription we can buy and improve the system.. The community itself came up with the money to do it \n\nAnother one, a woman was a member of the community decided to go to india and become a buddhist monk , after some months , she became ill terribly. She was going to die. Word got back to us and a doctor in the community found a contact person to work with; and the community itself raised the money to airlift her with a helicopter, take her to the hospital where the doctor\u2019s contact had prepared the ground, and treat her. She could then go back to the monastery. No one, I think saw, here again.\n \nThat the community itself could do so for a person who didn\u2019t see for month and may not see again, this was an incredible experience. It blew us away. We were clearly onto something.\n\nOne thing I found, when going deep with people (not doing something for a week or month, not a collaboration), you are on a journey you make together, not a marriage, but you trust that collectively you can figure it out, \n\nSome people have leadership roles and some have supporting roles, like in a kitchen , not everyone is a chef. These roles can switch, you can have a supporting role then change and so on. \n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Cindy]\n\nAn innovation setting creates a context where you can deal with uncertainty. In fact, dealing with uncertainty is central: you are trying to do something that\u2019s not been done before. What\u2019s the infrastructure for that?\n\nI have a very broad definition for infrastructure, and I want to hear more from you about it, includes ethos \u2026\u2026.then there are the frameworks and actual processes, the legalities, the technical infrastructure, and physical infrastructure, \n\nThe setting and the environment created by the people, creating safe spaces in order to nurture innovation, and organizational team , individual ...as infrastructure. And that forms multilayered infrastructure as  well. \n\nThis includes a critical review of the infrastructure; a common language and lexicon; common meanings; common or shared interests \u2013 they are all part of the nurturing infrastructure.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Eta]\n_**How do you balance the organic dynamics of the group with the need for infrastructure building and management?**_\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Cindy]\nIn the current project that I am part of coordinating we have 11 partners different types of organizations they all have different structure, \n2 levels here:\n\n* Creating an understanding \n* Then going back to the individual teams \n\nOne of the roles that I do, listening to each organization and make capacity building workshops, the individual values and how this relate to the organization and their local environment and to the project\nBy having the discussion framed this way, this creates a common understanding towards common shared interest, these are teams that hardly do so as they have different structural levels,  ( this is within the same team ) \n\n( this in between different organization ) \nThe other aspect of it, each org, they are very particular and I organize exchanges in between each other \n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=John Coate]\nWe started out by talking about values first. That\u2019s where we began. We as a group came to mutual understanding to what you can call a right life, we came into alignment, to be the change you want to see and we focused on that first. We were not very skilled in survival, some college degrees but mainly in English and literature, this doesn\u2019t really help in building a water system. \n\nWe made the values clear. At the same time, if you try to get everyone to agree on the every single thing that you believe, well\u2026 better bring lunch, because it might be a long process. We discovered we could find enough common ground, without necessarily agreeing on 100% of the issues. Our focus on medical care reflects that: we needed it to survive, and it was somehow uncontroversial among the group. Even if we do not agree on the fine points of doctrine, we can still do good work together, and bring about some concrete improvements. The clinic in DC, the ambulance service in NYC, these were concrete, and they were good. They would not have come about without collaboration with others, that often did not share all or even most of our values.\n\nYou can\u2019t hit people too hard with your values. For instance: non-violence. We were all vegans, but you can\u2019t require others to be. Don\u2019t judge other people as \u201cselling out\u201d. What is a deal breaker or not? This little group isn\u2019t going to solve the world\u2019s problems by ourselves. We need to work with other people.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Georgie]\nQ: Can you preset boundaries \u2013 define them in advance?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=John Coate]\nYes: at what point do you feel so compromised that you can\u2019t work with the other person? \n\nBut not too tight or not with too much restrictions.. ( example of being a vegan community but collaborate and work with non-vegan, \u2026\u2026\u2026.but not work with violent groups for example )\n\nAlso depends on the situation, for example just before coming here in the last 2 weeks the place where my mother and family caught fire \u2026.and you will not stop and discuss political stands in this situation.\n\n_**Q: What do others think of the idea that it is hard to work without a leader?**_\n_Constantly reassessing the tactics used in a groups. Often some people take on leadership roles, etc._\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Eta]\nThere are people\u2019s natural tendencies \u2013 some people dive in and do a lot. Some people take on a more supportive role. Problematic when those roles reify and are not addressed. How do we also recognise that this week, this month, I may need to step back and take care of myself, or conversely have the energy to come to the fore? How do we let those roles organically switch between participants in the group?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Cindy]\nWe struggled with in public lab \u2013 roles were fluid, hadn\u2019t been defined. Different roles have different speeds which don\u2019t match. Community organisers takes a long time to build trust. Tech people work at a different speed. Recognise parallels between different roles. We hadn\u2019t defined the speeds and roles. Having playful times helped us to get to know body language and tacit signals etc. Knowing each other and knowing ourselves.\n_**Q: How do you define the boundaries? Need to know where you are at a particular time.**_\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Gehan]\nSometimes we over-focus on leadership. More important is \u201cpower literacy\u201d. Many groups aspire to flat structure with no leaders, but the power dynamics are dubious. Needto understand how power works in groups of people. Flat structure doesn\u2019t work without power literacy.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Eta]\nRe-evaluating is important as you go along.\n[/quote]", "created_at": "2017-10-26 23:16:04.915503", "updated_at": "2017-10-31 23:44:30.596212", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2279, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 48.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18065, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1856, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Great!

Here's where the tasks are featured:\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/get-your-ticket\n\nOnce you set up the other tasks, I will feature those that can be taken on by anyone (for example this task of setting up the minisite page was more for site admins). Point 11 in the <a href=\"/t/organizing-a-conference-with-edgeryders-eu-drupal-7/3279\">manual</a> tells you how if you want to do it yourself (you may need admin rights). For now, each task is worth a ticket, you can change that per task if you think it's necessary (at most have the options of 1/2 of a ticket; or 1/3 of a ticket, no more because we'd get confused). We can then have an internal spreadsheet to monitor, for each person registered, how tasks add up to one ticket. Even with Makerfox which recorded weighted contributions, Natalia and I would still monitor them manually in a spreadsheet.\n\n<strong>Team</strong>s:\u00a0we feature individual tasks so people take them on easily and know where to look for this week's To Dos. The coordination roles we can assign verbally, among ourselves, so people doing Agenda and tracks would post their own tasks and oversee their completion. People moved in and out of teams anyway last year and there's no way on the platform to actually coordinate a team.. last year we would agree on who leads and people had their own processes.

Many, many codes need **forking** (there are too many compound codes that won't occur more than once or twice).\n2. **Create parent-child relations.**\n3. Too many meaningless invivo codes (only use invivo if they capture something unique and interesting)\n4. Fix capitalisation (only proper nouns should be capitalised).\n5. Fix invivo designations (double quote for invivo, single quotes for concepts).\n6. Be more **parsimonious** -- most of these codes won't occur multiple times. Think about the SSNA -- what will be likely to meaningfully co-occur? This means a) assigning less only slightly different and synonymous codes but also b) assigning more high-value codes that will ultimately co-occur with more concepts, and therefore produce richer codes in interaction with each other. By assigning lots of very specific codes, you miss the opportunity to see the meaningful interactions created by participants.\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive that forking codes will lead to more parsimony, but once you fork the codes you'll see that they then will be mergeable with other codes, creating less codes with more co-occurrences (rather than lots of codes with very few occurrences or co-occurrences). \n\nTomorrow we'll make a start on this together and I'll show you what I mean through examples, and then we can continue the work asynchronously. Please do not code any new threads until this is done and use your hours to do this code refining work --- we need to up the code quality before we proliferate more codes.\n\nAs a brief example: \nCo-code \"future\" + \"internet\" rather than creating lots of codes like \"future of the internet\" \"future of technology\" \"future of everyday life\". \n\nThe first approach will give you a semantic web of future + all the concepts related to the future. the second method/process won't ever show up on the SSNA.\n\nCoding in the former way will also allow you to see the global concepts that you'd miss otherwise --- otherwise, the codes won't show you much about the collective. \n\nLooking forward to our call! @Leonie @katejsim.", "created_at": "2020-08-17 16:52:41.795478", "updated_at": "2020-08-17 16:53:35.577572", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 355, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81258], "is_liked_by": [5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27159, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4415, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>like it but it doesnt say \"future\" to me</b>\n\n...yet.

An overview of the current youth policy agenda of the main European institutions is also provided. What brings new light and raises many challenges in this regard, are the results of the Edgeryders project [1] representing a Think Tank of citizen experts working on a policy document concerning the transition of youth to an independent active life, on behalf of the Council of Europe [2] and the European Commission. Reflecting on experience of the project participants, the main challenges of the existing youth policy framework, especially related to social innovation, were described and discussed, based on the ethnographic report[3], an overview of the genuine material produced by the project participants through the online platform, and overview of the existing literature[4]. As a member of the Pool of European Youth Researchers (PEYR), the author especially emphasizes the value of this project in connecting young people, researchers and the decision makers/ institutions at the European level through joint effort in exploring challenging and complex reality, and developing innovative strategies in order to address it in line with the message expressed by one of the participants \u2015\"The system requires a Reset\".\n\nfile_fid:3953 -", "created_at": "2014-11-19 16:03:03", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 14:58:42.156837", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 253, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38817, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7575, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-27 13:09:36.894812", "updated_at": "2017-10-27 13:09:36.894812", "deleted_at": "2017-10-27 23:44:35.028004", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84910, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 155, "raw": "I confess that my little group and I had to go back to our bus and finish fixing it before we could leave.

Balance.\n\nNow there are effects on learning, motivation and behaviour change that relates to the idea of overcoming hurdles. In psychological terms we speak of [effort justification](https://dictionary.apa.org/effort-justification), so we would want to give a learning experience that is percieved as hard to overcome to make the learner feel that they have achieved something worthwile - at the same time we must make sure that the effort needed is not so large as to make the lesson aversive and as such drive away the learner.\n\nNow in more detail, I imagine that easy UX combined with hard lessons is a more beneficial way to go. Such as the effort put in by the learner is dedicated to solving and working with what is to be learn rather than the logistics of finding the right material or struggling with unintuitive UX.\n\nI would love do discuss this more, I have some other examples on how effort affect learning!\n\n/E", "created_at": "2020-12-09 18:15:59.063908", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 18:15:59.063908", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 176, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88741], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12979, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>good point&gt; not necessarily solid, but networky&amp;legal will do. </b>\n\nGood point.

What we need is tagging with defined taxonomies. About 80% of the Hypothesis code will care with more basic stuff like the browser extension, data storage architecture etc.. So yes, one <em>could</em> join efforts and base an online ethnography software on this. In fact we have considered other \"web-wide\" annotation infrastructure as a basis when discussing Open Ethnographer initially, and the reason against it was finally this: much of the value and meaning of the data in online ethnography comes from its context (who wrote it, to whom, when etc.), which we only know if it's data on our own platform. So in Open Ethnographer, we don't just store annotations about an URL, but about a node or comment, which are Drupal datastructures that also store author, creation date etc..\n\nHypothesis might be prepared to store such meta information, but using a browser extension to annotate your own website is quite overkill / too complex.

More than 50% of Americans can't cover the bill for an ER\n\n_(Podcast skillshare<br/>Land upstate)_\n\n\n### ZAD presentation:\n\n**Namid, Liliana, Sara, Claire**\n\nLand occupation set up to fight an airport project, in a struggle for 15 yrs. The occupation movement exists only for 8 yrs, created through a call out. 10 square km, as big as the biggest villages in France. 200-300 people who made the choice to live there. Several thousands involved. Organizing without state infrastructures. How to avoid relations of domination, hierarchy, specialization. Collective autonomy. Diversity of thoughts, but fascists not welcome. \n\n\n### How they organize:\n\n* Daft structures\ncabins, farmhouses, tents. A lot of agriculture with machines, collective gardens - grain and beans to feed a nonmarket and support other struggles.\n\nThey built a lot of infrastructure: spaces for tractor mechanics, woodwork, preservation spaces. Weekly newspaper, radio, website zad.nadir.org, welcome houses, internal telecom network. No police, no justice. Conflict mediation group. Autonomous health care. Some people don't have health insurance, no legal papers, or access to cars or phone to do paperwork in the city. Fugitives, people traumatized by the medic system. \n\n\n### 4 spaces of care:\n\nLa transfuse cabin for first aid, Trailer Medic for free/cheap medical assistance, Varies Rouge medical house a collective living there similar to a hospital, Medicinal Cabin for storing and drying medicinal plants. \n\n\n### Varies Rouges:\n\nSees 10 25 people a week, medical problems or who want a tattoo for their dog. At least 1 person available that can do care - a mix of self aid and accompanying medical surgeries - opened wounds, dog attacks, police.\nAll materials are donated, i.e. by hospitals, medicine are free prices, tinctures are one tenth of retails, support group of professional. We're not trying to do everything or be the heroes, but there's a lot we can do. \n\nWe help people without papers to get into medical institutions, and take responsibility for it. \n\nCARE for people  caught in armed conflicts I.e. with the police in demonstrations - rubber bullet injuries, grenades. Fight the part of the state that is intentionally hurting its people. \n\n\n### Trainings:\n\nShort, for life vital help and first aid. 9 day for people in the zed, in a certain region so afterwards they can work together in their city, for example in demonstrations.\nA network of people who've been through these trainings (80) so they can call out to the other groups. Easier to organize together because they have the same protocols.\n\nWe grow our own medicine in the medicinal garden and harvest them. Use them in consultations for chronic problems.\nRegular Drop in clinics for exchanges, training and giving care at the same time.\n\n\n### About mental health:\n\nNo filter, anyone can come when they want. We're now at the step of collecting information and finding professionals support.\n\nWhy do we do this? To take control of what happens with our lives, put ourselves on a learning path. The person who has the power to decide is not the same as the person who has the knowledge about their body.\n\n\n### Important to work in teams:\n\nWe are not experts. In emergency situations, it's important to be 2.\nTo build a base of knowledge to be collectively autonomous. Yes we live 20mins away from the hospital, but do they come in 20mins? No.\n\n---\n\n\n### REFLECTION:\n\n* What does health autonomy look like for you?\n* How does your work or expertise contribute to that? \n* What is it that you need, the next step for you?\n\n[quote=Eugenia]\n\n_Artist and ecologist_\n\nProject How to perform an abortion.\nReproductive health Laws are flawed.

The connections and response grow naturally out of the threads.\n\n* **Peer to peer is very important. Skill sharing has happened cross vast geographical spaces.**\n\n**Key themes that have emerged:**\n\n* Precariousness - self of isolation, find place in society. People want to be autonomous.\nMental Health - alleviation of stress - food sharing and cooking, gardening, intergenerational connection. Stigmatisation of mental health. Need for professional help as well as p2p\n* Migration - current solutions of giving care ok, but better to look at solutions that self-autonomise the response from within the communities displaced.\n* Fighting against propriety - comes back to autonomy again. DIY and breaking through preexisting legal issues and structures. Regulation vs \u2018open\u2019. Importance of having a safety net of regulation as well.\n* Battling our \u2018illnesses\u2019 - the world is broken, not us. It doesn't accommodate the needs of people - e.g open trampette, openinsulin.\n\n**The right resources, but in the wrong places - Crossing borders, navigating the systems that are in the world, but keeping the open nature of ideas and needs.**\n\n**E.g**\n\n* Streetnurses - taking care to those who can\u2019t go to the hospital. Sharing best practices for disaster relief.\n* Finding meaning off the beaten path - people looking for ways to find happiness, but also looking for \n* Fixing what is broken - community is significantly trying to reform systems from the inside and outside.\n\n**Tensions:**\n\n* Autonomy vs community building - in control of one\u2019s life against social isolation.\n* Inside institutions vs pushing from the outside\n* Safety (legalist/regulation) vs DIY/Opensource\n\n**What have we learnt:**\n\n* Tech is not a cure all. People exist in real communities and real contexts.\n* People are the best technology. People most need access to other people. Skills knowledge and sharing. The best thing tech can do is bring them closer to each other.\n* Bringing network science and ethnography has been very useful.\n\n_Self care only takes us so far.<br/>Institutional care only takes us so far.._\n\n**Questions:**\n\nWith tensions. These tensions are evidenced within the conversations online. These are the lines that people have been wrestling with.\nWe yesterday talked about:\n\n* Autonomy vs community building - in control of one\u2019s life against social isolation.\n* Inside institutions vs pushing from the outside\n\nFining the tags that coexist together frequently, but where there is a tension between the two ideas/concepts.\n\nThe vs. is not a true representation. The tension is not in direct opposition They can sit together.\n\nWe will often find these tensions within threads, because of the nature of the community - some very keen to push against, some well within the institutions who see ways of working from inside. These conversations occur\nThese communities often don\u2019t talk to each other outside of ER platform. - SWASHLOCKER link, on the internet no-one knows you\u2019re a dog. More diverse interaction than offline. This makes it more inclusive.\n\n* Bringing people together\n- Storytelling, the division between talking and action - what is the culture of conversation? How does it happen. The conversational culture of ER. How does this look through this system.\nPeople are not totally autonomous because they care about stuff. The care shows the links. People are dedicated to a cause or group. They aren\u2019t here just to talk to people.\nEngaging in CONSTRUCTIVE dialogue is why people are here. No trolling, no name calling even though people come from very different sides of a perceived divide.\n\n* Communities of interest\n- Ezio. Productivity comes from a shared interest. This is not a REQUIREMENT, but its self selecting. If this isn\u2019t what you\u2019re interested in your drop out.\n\nThe %age of conversations with value are really high.\n\nWould be interesting to see how these thing fit in with each other. Finding where things are based on \u2018activism\u2019 or on self-driven goals.

Mostly in technology companies. Invested in 15 companies. Most angel investors invest in what they know, eg. real estate.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Paola]\nConsider fellowships. Very analytical, structured way of approaching questions. Her work is looking at use of data in issues of social justice and criminal justice system. Used to work in Data For Justice: show inequalities in the criminal justice system. Lawyers, activists, advocates, \u2026 Gathered data and sued police department of Boston because they refused to open their data. Won the case. They were doing more stop and frisks in poor neighborhoods. The community was disproportionately targeted by the police department.\n\nBut she was a \u2018one woman band\u2019, and that\u2019s not sustainable. How can we get people paid, involve more people eg. through foundations of universities. Paola has been funded for her work through applying for fellowships. One at Harvard, MIT, Mozilla. Little by little gaining more experience and data for strategies that can be applied in different contexts.\n\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Chris]\nHas been active on the platform. He\u2019s looking specifically at legal frameworks that open new ways to create assets and manage them. A government is an agreement, a company is an agreement. Instruments (eg. shares, debt, derivatives). Nuance between rules of the game and the ball. If you\u2019ve got resources, why do you need money? What sort of agreement or accounting or means of keeping score to do what we need to do. Has been conducting an international review and a historical review. What was here before banks? Commons? No, made proprietary. How has it been enclosed? 75% of money in existence is based on land. Came about through banks lending money for mortgages. Nobody really knows how the system works. How can we use complementary means to get done what we need to do with as little need for the system as possible, bootstrapping.\n###Group for the long term:\n\n\n* **Henri:**\n Big botanical garden, bionics. It\u2019s a venue. Alternative building and experimental building. Community living on site. Providing services for the events. POC21.\n\n* **Sohayeb**\nNGO Specialized in development. Several projects in mainly empowering people in marginalized and rural areas. Trainings, incubation, skilling up programs. For now doing all of these program for free, but looking for ways to make the program sustainable.\n\n\n* **Rami**\nInformal consultant for community garden. The land was going to be sold off, possibly soon. In Oakland gentrification is a big problem, so they are now looking into land trusts. Write a toolkit while doing this, because it is a sustainable strategy.\n\n\n\n* **Fabio**\nOpen access health commons. Invite people to take care of their own health. It\u2019s software, mostly a creation process.\n\n* **Bernard**\nWorking on inventions for energy, water, economy. Mainly to have a kit so that everyone can create their own bank, their own money, to finance their own life.\n\n\n* **Bader**\nCivil servant in Tunisia ministry of tech. How can we use software development R&D IP for development with Tunisian and African youth. Collaborate between social entrepreneurship and existing state infrastructure.\n\n\n* **Winnie**\nopen insulin, a way to put the gains and the production factors that go into producing insulin into the hands of patients or supporting organizations that have the interests of patients in mind.\n\n\n* **Frank**\nTrying to buy a large plot of land. Experimental farm, retreat center, skill sharing, residential.\n\n* **Kate**\nA program in Italy where they\u2019re giving building to people under 40 without rent. Similar like Frank and Henri\n\n\nMoney or money\u2019s worth? We think of property as a thing. The development model in the UK is that you buy land, let it increase in value and sell it off. Land as a commodity. If you break down land, there are certain elements. First: rights of use (fishing, grow crops). Second: rights to fruits of use of land: who gets them. Mortgages: you\u2019re giving the banks the fruits of the use of the land. Third: right to keep somebody out, exclusion. These three rights can constitute the sharing of surplus.\n\nWe can easily create agreements that . If you have a piece of land and you put things into it (work, fertilizer, \u2026) and then you get stuff out of it and distribute it. The way that we have been scaling this has been through companies with shareholders. Everything is a cost for shareholders, they don\u2019t share.\n\nImagine a club where, if you are part of the club, you get the right to live there. It\u2019s going on in London. The club owns the land.\n\nYou go to a landlord and ask for the rights of use. They put in the land as an investment. And they get a return. You need to do it long term, so that you actually invest in the place (you won\u2019t do that if you are only there for 6 months).\n\n**Limited Liability Partnership.** \n\nA trustee says what will happen, a custodian says what will not happen. Moral rights. Non-dominion: no dominant rights, nobody tells you what to do. It is the right to be able to say no. \n\n**Asset partnerships.**\n\nA club is both open and closed. Anyone can become a member, but it only caters to its members.\n[/quote]\n\n\n\n## Group for personal financing\n\nWith Paola, @Noemi and @Heba \n**Takeaway: ideally you find an angle which helps make some aspect of your work attractive to a funder. This validates the project and you, Once you got in the first time then its easier in the next times.**\n\nPaola:  my theory is that collaboration is super expensive. Is should be paid because it is a lot of investment. We can convince foundations or orgs to pay people to collaborate.\n\n**Heba: When people have no idea how to make a product, how do you do it?**\n\nP: What inspired me is community organising. It happens for the sake of community. Same with collaboration.\n\nThe reason we do it is because we want to, not necessarily for an outcome.\nYou bring your own perspective: you ask questions, how tech and openness and care interact. First try to diagnose what collaboration is possible, we are creating a framework with which we can operate.\n\n**Q: What happens when an organisation like ACLU gets empowered through technology?** (Data for Justice project). That was a question that starts it, You have the organisation and the community, so you promise to create a framework, That makes the funders to understand that they are creating a tool.\n\nIts also a guide for how to design a project.\n\nHeba: still starting her project, doesnt know how to write a proposal. Working in a hard context in Egypt where its hard for civil society to work. Shes working on her project and not getting paid, but she has a support community which she can rely.\nNow collaborating with Hazem to write a concept not for the project to create a cycling infrastructure in Alexandria.\n\nShe wants to gather activists, see what they can do and put it out there to the community, then assess. \n\nP: There are urban fellowships to create this. IE Women cyclists scene - your output would be normalizing the attitudes.\nFriend who was a bicycle strategist in Mexico. The fundable project could also be: looking at how other cities did it.\n\nNoemi: can you hop from project to project, while you are already giving most of your time to a core organisation, similar to a full time job?\n\n**Q: What do you think of the civic tech. Civic hacking scene?**\nPaola: worked with or for the Mexico Innovation lab, or Code for America. They try to substitute the government, but the gov doesnt work. So its practical, but its not long term. The gov gets away with problems they dont have to solve, because the hackers do it and do it for free.", "created_at": "2017-10-26 23:43:16.960660", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 21:36:45.915986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1384, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 43.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83759, "user_id": 1520, "topic_id": 14192, "post_number": 42, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:35, topic:14192\"]\nThe idea that an employer would force me into an office building and then force me to deal with on-the-job things for eight hours straight is horror to me, and a reason why I never took up such a job and instead became self-employed.\n[/quote]\n\nMay be this is from the past.

The unMonastery project located in the unique urban context of Matera offers both a co-living/co-working prototype and an urban infrastructure for the development of several innovative social projects (environmental, urban, and educational).\n\nNext to the Matera 2019 administrative building, we stayed by the devoted typical dwelling space in Sassi, and shared the unMonks\u2019 life for 39 hours. 39 hours of intense co-dining, co-sleeping, co-napping, co-dancing and co-working sessions with the unMonks and some of their collaborators.\n\nBefore coming we knew already how inventive and smart was this original approach of social innovation and work in our current European cities. But by living there, we got to understand the actors and the scenery of such an exemplary experiment.\n\nThese ordinary people (unmarginal, unextreme, unwithdrawned) and yet unordinary (independent workers, well connected nomads, devoted human beings) are sharp and sensitive enough to display a lucid vision on our society. Their attractive collaboration is even sponsored by the city of Matera in order to work on its future innovation. We can even admit the process serves a more global prospective vision.\n\nAs for the built space they occupy and its urban location, it may have been many other options, but the first prototype found its fitted environment here in Matera, in the social context of this small city (candidate for the 2019 European capital of culture), and in these historical troglodyte spaces: where the light dispersed by the high vaults provides a right atmosphere for work, the unhierarchical clustered spaces promote freedom of co-habiting, the large and round rooms enable variety of space organisation and uses, the rooms\u2019 direct connections to the public path and the public terraces open onto the city, and where the 5 minutes walking distance to the city centre includes the unMonastery in the urban system.\n\nCities and citizens should realise the benefit of such temporary workshop on our society and its environment. And at least, if the last don\u2019t take part, we hope they inspire of such initiatives to be creative in such crisis context.

I suffer similar symptoms, but less frequent,\u00a0 and have become skilled at playing down the symptoms due to the stigma attached. When the pain is less than 6 out of 10, I work and close my eyes when I get the chance. Causes could stem from the fact that I've had a few notable head traumas, but I'm not sure, more likey to be food related in my case. Doctors diagnosis is migrane, broad ranging and I've had no specific ENT tests.\n\nPain meds kind of work if I get it in time. I've done the vipassana meditation course. It isn't for \"fixing\" migranes, but it showed me the things I've been doing wrong and gave me some tools that, to be honest, I haven't been utilizing properly. It's described as a \"surgical procedure\", which I thought was a bit dramatic until I tired the technique. It's not for everyone and shouldn't be taken lightly. I'm very glad I done it though.\n\nI grew up with processed food and have been trying to get away from it. I have a sugar addiction. Growing food helped me improve my diet and lifestyle, but I still have way to go. If I cut out processed foods, maintain regular exercise and daily meditative practice I think I can stay pain-free. I definitely wouldn't have written this in a public forum if it wasn't for your post, so thank you, it's given me the reminder I need to write food plans and stick to them.

This is just the nature of the syntax unfortunately.\n\nMy recommendation: if you have very long text with lots of formatting, and it needs to go into one of these configuration blocks, paste the whole configuration block (from the first` {` to the last `}`) into a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com). \n\nThis will tell you immediately if there is a problem with your syntax (it will show in red text where the problem is) - and if it is valid it will tell you so.\n1.

Out of this group maybe less than 10 have responded with submission to the form. This is great anyway, because they are bringing in contacts who are creating social innovation in Armenia, and they are candidates for travel grants. We don't need huge response rates for the form submission. But I say let's maximize this opportunity and not just be satisfied that the other 400 users who simply liked our FB page.\u00a0\n\nI'd like them to enter Edgeryders itself in a meaningful way.

We relay the message via our personal FB accounts since we do not have their email addresses (it is Facebook's job to keep us away from direct contact info; otherwise they go out of business).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>It is important that we share the labor of sending the message via personal accounts. If one person tries to direct message too many non-friends in a short period of time they will end up in \"Facebook prison\" very quickly. With over 400 new Armenians ultimately, I would try to get 40 edgeryders to volunteer to send 10 direct messages over 2-3 days to avoid tripping Facebook's alarm system. Maybe create slight variations int the text when you send it each time to avoid detection. I can do the job of recruiting some volunteers from Edgeryders on Twitter or here, but if you think you can do this then please ping me so that I can add you to a list of volunteers.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>We share the discussion post on our Facebook page, then \"boost it\" with ad money which then makes it show on the newsfeed of several thousand Armenian FB users. It's a good backup plan for distributing the link and it would cost around 20 euros, which I can draw from the pre-existing budget.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-05 14:49:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.954160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 428, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30129, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3409, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>an update of sorts.</b>\n\nJust wanted to make a short note here, to register some observations and give a sense of progress with this.\u00a0\n\nSo firstly, it seems setting up meets ups wasn't the best idea logistically - since the visits to cities have been so short and at a such a fast pace, it's added quite an overhead to planning that has yet to bare fruit.

Although one of the entries will maybe read 'came from outside / thin air' or 'went to the outside / poof'. \nYou're right that in a LETS the ledger total will be zero within the group of members. Except for when people with a negative balance leave the LETS by redeeming their negative balance in fiat currency (a way out many seem to offer, allowing you to leave without leaving a debt of good will let's say), when a 'went oudside' entry is needed.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:7569\"]\nBut note that negative balances (\"debt\") might socially not be the nicest way to express value relationships.\n[/quote]\n\nVery striking notion, yes. I've seen the effect in LETS. Esp LETS that bring together members that are in debt elsewhere, having a negative account comes with emotional baggage. I've also seen the opposite: where a member had been (planned and announced) saving up a large amount of LETS units, to use for when he would be moving his artist studio and needed lots of support from LETS members to get it done. Some started attacking him about his 'hoarding' and planning to 'lord it over them'. Not a fair assessment of what he was doing, but real emotions nonetheless.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:7569\"]\nWhile not blockchain stuff, we do it like that in PayCoupons:\n[/quote]\n\nLooks interesting, created an account. Interested to know more.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:7569\"]\nIn proof of work algorithms, not that I know of \u2013 easing difficulty would invite the 51% attacks. In proof of stake, there is no forced increase of difficulty, as no large amount of computing power is needed here anyway.\n[/quote]\n\nIt's not so much about easing difficulty, as it is about not increasing difficulty, is it? Proof of work is designed as make-work that uses up real and increasing resources. Resources, energy, that could be spend for the user group itself maybe, while letting proof-of-work be only real work.\nIf you run all the nodes of a blockchain within a defined user group (not as general infrastructure such as ETH or BTC), then part of the prevention of corrupting the ledger lies in the social relationships within that user group. In a LETS, or a group such as Edgeryders that is entirely within scope of all members. \nWhile large blockchain implementations, like ETH or BTC theoretically allow any user to validate whether the ledger has been corrupted, that by now requires an amount of equipment and energy that puts it beyond reach of any user, other than a handful of Chinese computing clusters, and a cave in Iceland. I have a copy of the blockchain on my laptop, but no real means to verify it, the very thing that is its foundation. Basically requesting me to put my trust in 'middle men' all over again. Even many BTC wallets stopped incorporating the full blockchain but refer to a server (outside the users scope) somewhere to get your balance. That's even worse as now a completely unverifiable gatekeeper is introduced as well.  These new middle men and gatekeepers aren't in the recognizable form of an institution or person but completely ephemeral and without redress mechanisms, by design. Hence my earlier remark about agency lying in being in actual control of a tool.

We plan to assemble around the coyly titled Global unMonastery Summit, a trilogy woven in infrastructure space - and distributed between living quarters, the foyer of Transmediale and a wifi mesh network to share privately between attendees and participants the learnings of The Book of Mistakes and other Bios related material.\u00a0\n\nEach component of the summit has been designed to offer alternative forms of engagement in the unMonastery\u2019s work, whether it be through intimate discussions, remote collaboration, or participatory workshops.\n\nYesterday the full festival programme has been released, allowing us to finally share it, and invite you to join us for unMonastery activities here in Berlin, remotely on the net, or at some far flung location in our collective future junkspace.\u00a0\n\nMore details will be online on unMonastery sessions and where you can find us in the coming days.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/transmediale/\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">http://unmonastery.org/transmediale/</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-24 09:44:26", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 15:42:58.437215", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 288, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14253, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4068, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Master Course on how to build effective sales pitches</b>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1060f6aa83bec35b7e7e8f33ffd536a215727497.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\nI don't know if you guys are interested but @Matteo_Uguzzoni is going to be running a 2-day course on building sales presentations on May 26-27 in Brussels.\n\nIt's such an important skill - so we are putting our own money into commissioning and attending the course.\n\nIf you know people who could use the course, you can send them here:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/powerpitch-a-2-day-masterclass-on-storytelling-for-conversion-may-26-27-brussels-tickets-34405185837\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/power-pitch-bxl-learn-how-to-build-presentations-that-achieve-your-goals-tickets-34405185837</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-07 15:06:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.586711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 147, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51040, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 9422, "post_number": 21, "raw": "I evaluated OnlyOffice a tiny bit, but no \"native\" support for Open Document Format (all documents will internally converted to the Microsoft format of which I willingly forgot the name, but this thing like xlsx), and a generally more closed surface than Collabora made me decide against it.\nFor diagramming, there is the really neat [draw.io](https://draw.io).

Indeed, I see rural areas as a good place to be, esp. in times of crisis where they are more sustainable than urban life (given cheaper land and housing costs, and the option to grow your own food in case of difficult income situations). As for rural lifestyle - it's personality dependent of course, but I don't miss much. What I need is a good Internet connection, some friends around and some travelling and nomad living from time to time. Given that DSL-speed Internet access is now available in all of Europe via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KA-SAT\">KA-SAT</a> for comparable costs, this is all a no-issue.\n\nI looked at your Master thesis, but I don't speak the language ... .

The idea is worth pursuing, the technology is there. First it was a technical motivation, afterwards it was clear that insulin was a social and economical issue. \n\nMany people don\u2019t have access, it\u2019s bad in the US. Only a few companies have the oligopoly on production globally (US, France, Denmark based).\n\nThere\u2019s also the fragility of the supply chains. Only major producers in the West, which means that supply is easily disrupted in less developed or accessible regions. We need to rely less on shipping insulin around and maintaining eg. a cold chain. This is a major barrier to getting insulin out where it needs to be. In short, we need to decentralise production.\n\n**Science and engineering:**\nWent through one proof of concept iteration in an E. coli bacteria (for troubleshooting methods). Took about a year. We made a precursor protein to insulin. Bacteria however is not able to convert the precursor into insulin, so since early 2017 we\u2019re looking at yeast, because that organism can do everything inside the organism. The protocol needs to be simple and easily reproduced.\n\n6 months - 1 year we will have engineered the strain that does everything. Then we can move to using the strain and producing or scaling up. So the question is now: how do we structure the legal entities to govern the production.\n\nTeams from Ghent (ReaGent) and Sydney (BioFoundry) joined the project. International collaboration is unfolding. We need to organise this better and set up some legal frameworks for sharing the IP that gets generated, keeping the goals of the project in mind, we want to have a commons framework. Allowing entities to use it, but making sure that they do so in keeping with commons principles. \n\nThe organisation needs to ultimately be accountable to diabetes patients. It can\u2019t be a misalignment like we have now with the large producers that mainly have a large profit motor. They just keep diabetics dependent, charge high prices, and don\u2019t innovate much otherwise. Prices went up by 1000%, even though production got cheaper.\n\nMany semi-independent manufacturing efforts that are localised, but sharing knowledge. \nA [diabetes] patient coop would be able to decide how much effort to put into prevention or researching cure vs manufacturing.\n\nThe FDA is the biggest player in making this a reality. Big part of this is making a rigorous case and showing the costs of illness and the benefits of our alternative. Depending on how their own incentives work, they might not care. \n\nWe have 2 goals, proposal is to split in two groups:\n\n\n### 1. How do we move from here to this cooperative?\n\nA cooperative as a platform where patients would be the main stakeholders.\nThe patent is not to stop other people from doing it, but to protect the \n\n**Characteristics of the agreement:**\n\nRate of profit determined by patients\nWhere it is invested is determined by patients.\n\nExample of medical cannabis cooperatives. Maybe we can use it as a template for our organisation. Tailor this to the local jurisdiction. \n\nWe need some kind of global scale organisation that holds the IP in custody. Perhaps a Swiss foundation. A public benefit corporation.\n\nForging alliances with city governments. Show that production at city scale is feasible and show that economic implications they have can be addressed. Eg. problem of people going to emergency rooms, which is a cost for the city, so open source insulin would make the hospital work better.\nLucas Gonzales. Epidemiologist. His job is to prepare for flu pandemics in the canary islands. As part of preparing the plan, he found out there\u2019s 8000\u2019s diabetics in the CI and there is no capacity on the island (comes from Germany). So in case of pandemic, they are screwed. This could be an angle.\n\nSynthetic pancreas people. Firewall of FDA and then they appealed to free speech. They don\u2019t sell, yet share the schematics. \n\nMake it look less like a market transaction, and more like a club: participating in the testing. \n\nAnalogy to Open Source Ecology. Centralized body of knowledge, localized operation to build machines by doing workshops etc. \n\n[quote=Chris Cook]\nAt the global level: memorandum of understanding, but otherwise you\u2019re free to do what you want.\n[/quote]\n\n* **Unincorporated association:**\nAgreement, but not in any legal form. 2 pager. For very early stage funding. Like a club. People have an account in the name of the club. This could be global from day 1, with members. It has a \u2018hatching clause\u2019 which makes it hatch into an actual legal form. \n\n### Action items:\n\n* Review relevant structures\n* Pitch this to city governments (Milan next month, Oakland, Ghent)\n* Have a legal structure, so that funders know where their money goes\n* Cali cooperative weed\n* Cooperatives in calif and europe (Switzerland? Winnie\u2019s contact Malcolm Bain? European Cooperative Association)\n* Centralized holder of IP\n\n**Review the agreement of Chris.**\n\nHave an inside trusted partner when you pitch this, so that\u2019s it\u2019s not 50 50 in they liked it not. Clear action plan with timelines. Open to input. Jump in early for a premium. Weigh the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of premium. Winnie can talk about it with the head of strategy for the City of Ghent.\n\n_In Oakland:_ never got to the head, always mid or low level managers. You need to get people in power to not necessarily endorse it, but mainly not stop it. An endorsement would really help though. A paragraph and collect signatures of \u2018innovation, super cool project\u2019. \n\n\n### 2. How do we do international collaboration?\n\n[quote=Winnie]\nPeople are disgusted by how biotechnology industry works. Morally it\u2019s not okay that people are taxed so much money. We started a collaboration in March between Oakland, Ghent, and Sidney. It was hard to get access to information - where are the best practices documented.

During LOTE3 we (and especially <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf Pavlik</a>) befriended a group of struggling local farmers who are completely shut out from access to credit. This means they cannot afford to do even the slightest improvement to their farms; and this, of course, locks them into a cycle of low added value farming. One of them, Cosimo, told me he grows wheat, which he sells at a pittance. I suggested he transforms himself and sells the transformed, higher value added product (for example flour), but he replied he has no way to build a mill or any other transformation tech <em>if that means paying cold cash</em>.\n\nAnother one, Francesco, who speaks reasonably good English, was very interested in the <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/\">Open Source Ecology</a> project. There is a vague hope to use their own \"field engineering\" skills and open source knowledge to upgrade their tech without needing to access cash and credit. A project like yours is much up the same street \u2013 and probably easier than building a tractor! The reason I mention this is that we could have someone in Matera talk to these guys and see whether they would be interested in helping out and beta testing your rocket stove. Am I making sense?

These workshops could be, for example, repairing broken devices using modular parts designed on the Open Structures grid system \u2013 either using existing parts or creating new ones, then sharing the part files and documenting the repair for others to make use of.\n\nBasically we want people in the workshops to be able to build upon existing projects and information in commons, add their own ideas, hard work and experience, and release the results openly in a way that others can build upon further.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-13 09:49:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.825093", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 266, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8962], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38863, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7591, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@rachel I took the liberty of moving these results into their own topic, which will make finding them easier. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-10-28 20:49:24.047314", "updated_at": "2017-10-28 20:49:24.047314", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 28.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38826], "is_liked_by": [3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27376, "user_id": 932, "topic_id": 2859, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Time for a chat next week?</b>\n\nWould you find a little time for a chat / hangout early next week where I could explain a little bit how we might deploy an first early version on Edgeryders?\n\nIt's going to be pretty much a manual thing still, but yes in the end the target is to automate as much as possible <img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\nRE: the slider, yes it could make sense, the problem is that it would be too heavy computationally to do for all the possible intervals, which is what I'd need to do with current architecture where the metrics are precomputed and the javascript just visualizes them (On the other hand it'd be very easy to do just for the network representation).\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-10 14:11:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.244811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 154, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27132], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15728, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 4097, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Twitterstorm!</b>\n\nLet's do a twitter storm for it!

Very soon this discussion might be moot \u2013 we might decide very soon to shut ER LBG down, demobilize and look for jobs while we still can.\u00a0\n\nWhat I am left with is that I work in my preferred style (do-ocracy, no veto power etc.), and on things I care about. This is a great privilege, and also the\u00a0<em>only</em>\u00a0way in which I personally have been known to get any result at all. I strive for more humility; some of it will come with age and wisdom \u2013 and I can assure you that, as a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K7GpYEtLVmA\">former minor rockstar</a>, I have already made great progress! But meanwhile, I am struggling uphill, and I need any edge I can get, and the steelier, the better. \"It's about a how\", that you present as a matter of style, feels to me an unreasonable extra demand, the straw to break the camel's back. Get in and pull, guys: bring in contracts, share them with others.\u00a0<em>T</em><em>hen</em>\u00a0I \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 will be able to relax.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-07 17:17:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.526252", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28160], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4147, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4114, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello Future Carers, today Edgeryders CEO Nadia El-Imam is at the <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/shaping-the-future-of-digital-social-innovation-in-europe-registration-14720795295\">Shaping the Future of Digital Social Innovation in Europe</a> conference in Brussels.

Item a in the scope of <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/9082-ict-10-2015.html#tab1\">the call</a> is called \"Collective awareness pilots for bottom-up participatory innovation paradigms\". The word \"pilots\" makes me think of projects that emphasize field testing of tools, by applying them to social innovation and sustainability problems. This is quite different from developing <em>new</em> tools; development might result from finding out, during the pilot, that tools need improvements, or need to be discarded altogether. It follows that the key deliverable of CAPSSI is <em>not</em> technology per se, but a proof-of-concept of collective awareness tech making headway in a social innovation and sustainability problem. Is this interpretation correct? Would a project that is 90% issue-centered piloting and 10% technical innovation \u2013 demonstrably needed to tackle the problem at hand \u2013 be acceptable?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-17 10:04:34", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 13:21:06.281101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 244, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7563, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4107, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>KITE onboarded</b>\n\nToday <a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a> and I had a conference call with Nick Haji and Mike Martin at KITE.

Europe does itself a disfavour by pumping millions of tax euros into Big Data projects with Big Telcos and Big Equipment Manufacturers (which they are actually doing right now!!!), since we need to find an own niche to compete within - for instance distributed architectures and small, but relevant, data.\n\nSimilarly, for technical systems and algorithms \"running\" Europe: it is already clear from how distant and incomprehensible Brussels seems to most people in Europe (and we have indications that this is the way people feel from the elections in 2014) that Europe is much more \"chaotic\" than that it can be optimized around any particular process or method. Europe, on the contrary, needs more processes and more methods than other countries/regions, precisely because it aims to be diverse, democratic and still united in such diversity and democracy.\n\nFor monetization, unfortunately it's not better than that we have a legal problem. Many technology companies and media companies are successfully spinning the myth that politicians can't beat technology - that they will always be out-innovated. We have no indications yet that innovations don't adjust to the market - if the law needs spying, the market provides spying. If the law needs data retention - we get cheaper harddrives and intricate location data selling business models. If the law requires public information to be owned, fenced and controlled - we get DRM, surveillance and centralized infrastructures.\n\nEurope has an idealogical problem in that it wants to be united in diversity - as far as shipping people to Brussels goes - but it has yet to realize a political plan for helping the European public contribute as well.

They asked people to create business plans in groups, and then to evaluate each other, the best ones were rewarded with seed money (that has been collected initially with a crowdfunding campaign). The MOOC was great, and we offered Babele for free to the university to use it for students to work together and collaborate. The result was a true success, for us: because it provved that the concept was working, and for them as well :-)\n\nSo now, we are trying to organize other partnerships like this, if you know any organization that would be interested, let me know.

(In the end all the values are calculated to know the average number of original cells in 100ml of a given sample.)\nThen, the other important thing to grasp is that each microbial colony seen the next day on the plates (containing millions of cells after the overnight growth) represents of a single original cell from the sample, that has replicated in a certain spot of the plate -  we call these 'colony forming units' because it is likely that there are lots of cells that actually don't make colonies (because they don't like the nutrients or the temperature or other parameters...).  In fact the purple 'Levine plates' contain bile salts that prevent a whole class of abundant bacteria from growing (gram+ ones, if this means anything to you). This helps us look for ones of interest, esp our 'bioindicator' for untreated sewage, _E. coli_, which allows us to think that tons of other unknown things (enteroviruses, micropollutants) are also probably in the sampled water.\nOf course, very importantly, one can't just sample without comparing to something or another, and generally there is always a positive control (here in Switzerland, we have used river water or even sometimes toilet water - I still meant to talk with the other Alberto more about how rivers are full of bugs... :) sadly...)  and a negative control, ordinarily tap water.\nFinally, you need to have confidence that your plates themselves are not going to just randomly have lots of things growing - an uninoculated control!  This was something we really lacked last week!  With the plates just freshly poured at La Serre, there were many possibilities for sources of contam, like the droppers we used to inoculate the plates with the water samples. Finally, the plates normally should have some time to lose excess water, otherwise the colonies can be smeary and very hard to distinguish one from another...\nOne other variable is the treatment of the sample.  Ordinarily the rule is, after sampling, the tube must be kept in the cold and plated within 5 hours.  Our tubes, perhaps, were not entirely sterile, and they were just carried around and left until we did the plating after dinner...  \nAsk more questions if this is not clear.\nI will put an image up showing a collection of plates from one of our sampling days this last summer.  (we had another special plate, termed 'chromogenic' that allows one to distinguish at least 4 kinds of bacteria, and even a fluorescent substrate that confirms _E.coli_ - pics of this are in the prezi...)\nThen, as you say, we ultimately want counts that give numbers that we can use for statistical tests, like the T-test...  \nFor these tests though, you need at least 3 samples averaged to compare.  \nHowever, we only had one set of 3 plates with counts, and their variance was so high, not much could be said, esp without an average of 3 from controls to compare against!\n\nCounting more than once is another good option, and we could have attempted that - actually we still could using some pictures!  But, because of the problem of the negative controls full of colonies (but at least not E. coli), we would still have a very difficult time drawing meaningful conclusions.  The crazy incubation in the bathtub also meant that the plates were not only super smeary, but a couple only had saran wrap as a cover, and got squashed!  Also one could imagine bacteria floating on water droplets to cause all our negative controls to have so many colonies (if it wasn't the droppers we used or the tubes we collected the samples in, which were left at RT too long...)!\n\nQuantitative biology is coming of age now, I should note - tons of old papers that relied on stats p<0.05 are now realised to be completely underpowered and with non-reliable conclusions.\n\nI am happy you asked some probing questions!\nHave a great Sunday!!\n\nHere is an example of plates from one week's sampling last summer.  \nThe positive controls have lots of colonies, the negative controls almost none, and the regional samples (from Lake Geneva around Montreux Bay) have varying amounts.  To note, 0.5ml was put on the positive controls, and unknowns here had 4ml per plate inoculated.  Again, in the end you make the numbers per 100ml (as in Alberto Rey's Bagmati graphics...)!\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f82ffa172e60e94ffe165423f9ebf25e6f5f16c3.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\nHere is the summary I made already, with a few extra things:\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/01f64f724a0b2db33d255703ea49bd104e6f2941.jpg\" width=\"689\" height=\"487\">", "created_at": "2017-10-29 08:39:03.763649", "updated_at": "2017-10-29 08:39:03.763649", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 922, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 818.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362, 200, 4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18249, "user_id": 1679, "topic_id": 4125, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Great tip, thanks</b>\n\nHi Matthias, yes I know about the CHEST, we participated at one of the CHEST challenge.

If I understood well, CHEST was like a competition, you could apply with your project, see others, rate it, maybe make a comment, and then you knew if you got the funding to create your project or not.\n\nBabele is more bottom up, there is no competition. Babele is for now a collaborative business modeling: you structure your idea into a strategy (there is a framework with questions that guide you through a reviewed version of the social business canvas) and your project is open, so everybody can see what you have written in each part of your business model, and they can contribute, comment, join your team. etc. We are trying to introduce something like open business modeling, inspired by the idea of open source code. The ultimate vision, is that this would empower people to create concrete and efficient common good projects, and that the projects that are really solving problems and are socially oriented would be easily replicable, because there is already the entire business model described.<span>\u00a0</span>\n\nIt would be fantastic if you would put Makerfox in Babele.

Since he could not make it to the COVID response call this Monday, so we met up in a direct call to start some ideas.\n\n## @federico_monaco is currently working on 3 things:\n\n1. Working with his district to develop some collective intelligence approaches for crisis management and citizen engagement. The district becomes a problem solver. Like with the fab lab Barcelona. They used open tech to make citizens aware of their abilities to improve the district. \nSee the example here: https://pablocommons.github.io/pablocommons.github.io/english\nYou click on certain corners on the map and you get the information provided by citizens.\nAre there other entities like that like the district that would be open to work like that. We are working a lot with immigrants.\n\n### NEED: \n* He looks for other districts in Europe that would like to construct a collective intelligence project.\n* He looks for developers who could join the further development of the city map project. (ping @mstn?)\n* Problem: can currently not continue to map the city using 360-degree image in tech due to curfew\n* Look for potential connections with Plato (ping @hugi). (https://pablocommons.github.io/pablocommons.github.io/english\n\n\n2. Working for education. The schools are not used to learning or teaching via distance. We are trying to provide help with homework and events for families. He has done a project with Virtual Reality mapping of schools as well as teaching children between 5 and 10 to use VR for fun and to communicate ideas.\n\n### OFFER:\n* Webinar on virtual classrooms: https://scuolavirtuale.github.io/\nCould do  webinar/1week course for parents, children (5-10) and educators to learn how to use VR and to make digital teaching more engaging. (more below)\n\n3. Working with the hospital: He has been trying to connect to doctors and nurses or even students are willing to collaborate with us to provide the best information and provide prevention. \nHelping them to develop more effective communication strategies for children\nHelping them engage communities\n### NEED: \n* More help to connect and find willing healthcare professionals as collaborators.\n\n# OFFERS:\nWould do/share into a webinar/ 1 week course to use VR and online teaching as creative space. (Using the Edgeryders platform as a forum for the course)\nEverything that is related to helping with the crisis.\n\n\n### Notes on first ideas for Social Virtual reality Painting Course:\n\n(See reference project on virtual classrooms: https://scuolavirtuale.github.io/\n**Interesting point:** *Let\u2019s think about virtual classrooms in general!* )\n\n## The goal of the course is:\n* To make virtual reality accessible to children, \n* To give children a creative outlet in times of quarantine and curfew \n* To use technology to empower creativity to give them means to articulates their wishes for development to test \n* To conduct online teaching in a more holistic way combining digital, analogue, asynchronous and synchronous work\n\n### The first draft outline:\nWorkshop for children to learn how to draw environments for VR by hand:\n\n* 1-week course for 4-5 families:\n* Start first day with pre-recorded introduction video \n* Provide link to resources\n* Provide MOOC/Manual on Edgeryders (authored by @______) for looking up stepps and discussing questions with expert available to answer\n* Finish on last day with video call with slot for presentation for each child's project (preferably not on zoom)\n* Encouraging families to upload and talk about children's drawing (no images of the children, just the drawings!) \n* Encouraging to make the room created connected to the topic of the quarantine.

The reasoning is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Once individual partners put down in writing what they propose to do, we can all make a clearer-cut case for us being excellent at it in the verbose part of the application.</li>\n\n<li>As we do so, we are likely to see with greater clarity what each of us needs from other partners, resulting in a more elegant cross- partnership collaboration pattern.</li>\n\n<li>We democratize the budget: partners write down what they think they need at the WP level, then we negotiate as we make it a whole.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFor this to work, it is essential that we all stay relatively frugal. We are looking at a project under 1.5 M EUR, with 6 partners and 5 WPs: online conversation, prototyping, policy design, network analysis for collective intelligence harvesting, project administration (this last one is mandated). Each partner should receive around 200K \u2013 a little more if they are leading a WP, a little less if they are not. WeMake and Edgeryders are already at work: others are encouraged to do the same. Let us set a deadline: how about Monday March 9th?\n\nRemember: the budget of 1.5 M is the amount of the requested contribution from the EU. This means that your direct costs will have to be lower than that. In a research project such as Future of Care, the EU funds 100% of the project's direct costs. Indirect costs cannot be funded directly, but they are assumed to be 25% of direct costs (please check the unusually well-written <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/pdf/press/fact_sheet_on_rules_under_horizon_2020.pdf\">Horizon 2020 Rules Facsheet</a> . So, the formula to compute the requested contribution is:\n\n<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">direct costs x 1.25</code>\n\nFor example, for a non-profit like Edgeryders, the EU funds 100% of research costs; under Horizon 2020 indirect costs are recoginzed to be 25% of direct costs for all kinds of organizations. So, if Edgeryders spends 8000 EUR for some research activity, it will ask for a contribution of\n\n<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">8000 x 1.25 = 10000</code>\n\nUnder the simplifying assumption that all costs behave like this, to ask for a 200K EUR EU contribution you will have to budget direct costs for:\n\n<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">200K/1.25 = 160K EUR</code>\n\nand no indirect costs at all.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-27 08:35:30", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 13:23:39.559251", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 456, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17485, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4144, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>OSCE days as model for sustainable incubators/marketplaces</b>\n\n*after a beer and a long day*: The amount of time and resources \u00a0that go down the drain due to lack of open access to information, interoperability and efficient coordination between smaller actors is not something I have data about.

We are a not-for-profit organisation that grew out of a project funded by the Council of Europe in 2011. We have built an open online platform that allowed hundreds of individuals to share their experiences of rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown. We also created a methodology and software that helped process and analyse the information provided.\n\nWe soon realised that the open platform, methodology and software could be used for other projects too. Over the past eight years, we have [6000 registered users, 70,000 posts](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-visualized-a-tentative-animation/13751) and members of our communities have orchestrated some fascinating collaborative projects - from advising cities on how to win the title of European Capitals of Culture to harnessing our network to create training tools for effective remote work.\n\n**Why Edgeryders?**\n\nWhen you join Edgeryders you become part of a community where everytime someone shares or posts about a project, like minded peers offer advice or connect it with new information that supports the work of that person. Often it evolves into collaborative projects. We build a deep experience that no small group or individual could reach on their own.\n\n**How we work**\n\nThe process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the platform, sparking discussion.\n\nThese conversation starters happen around activities we organise, which include: listening sessions, webinars, online co-creation workshops, person to person support sessions and online hackathons. \n\nAfter ideas and thoughts have been exchanged, our open source technology makes connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles.\n\nWhen we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n**So, what are you waiting for?**\n\nIf you are an activist, entrepreneur, changemaker, expert, hacker or doer who thinks they can change something within our society, join the Edgeryders community today by signing [up here](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login). Introduce yourself to our community in a New Topic in our [Campfire](https://edgeryders.eu/).

This is a very well-thought through service. What I love most is your response team concept: it works even at the level of, say, 10 friends that live in a 2 km radius from each other. Then, like the best networks, it can be\u00a0<em>scale-free:</em>\u00a0suppose I am using Buoy here in Brussels, I have my little response team etc. Next up, I\u00a0visit my friend in Milano; suddenly I am detached from my response team, but if my friend is also using Buoy, she and I can be on each other's response team. Also, she can ask her own response team to opt in in my own, and viceversa I will be part of theirs. Voil\u00e0: everyone in my friend's response team now has skeletal Buoy coverage should they ever come to Brussels \u2013 and of course I can ask my response team to add them, too. The scale-freedom there is that my friend and I become hubs, stringing together my local network in Brussels and hers in Milano. I can't emphasize how powerful this is: Buoy is viable at a small scale.\u00a0\n\nI am definitely intrigued by the idea of trying it out when we next deploy in a geographically defined space: this could be Galway, actually. I see in your FAQs that you have already thought of <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#what-if-people-send-alerts-in-situations-that-arent-real-emergencies\">Buoy as a suicide prevention tool</a>.

Do they want to make a living or do they want the community activities to be like a hobby and playground for their afterwork?\n\nI know communities that work with minimum finances because everyone involved does so voluntarily after their jobs. And those involved in coordination and planning of activities dont wish/ need to be paid for that work.

Along those lines, I think you might be interested in looking into bystander training, where members of your community who are interested can learn how to best support people, and connect them to the care they need. I'm not sure where you're based, but one I can recommend is <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/cs/faq/\">Mental Health First Aid</a>, which is offered (often for free) in a number of countries.\n\nHope some of this is useful! I would also love to hear more about how these issues are already being addressed within your community.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-10 17:19:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:46.535139", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 281, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 2.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38878, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 7591, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Great summary and explanations @rachel !

I really enjoyed LOTE4 and meeting everyone. It's a repost from my blog.\n\n-------\n\nI did a lot of being in large groups last year - in groups within which the members share the belief - and I think we are right here - that communities are the way we will move the world forward.\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\">\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_175993748\" style=\"width: 710px;\">\n\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"https://katausten.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_9074.jpg\"><img alt=\"CC-BY Sam Muirhead\" class=\"wp-image-175993748 size-large\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://katausten.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_9074.jpg?w=700\" width=\"700\"></a></dt>\n\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">CC-BY Sam Muirhead - That's me looking a bit awks in the hat on the right</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n</div>\n\nPartly, my heart sinks at this. I'm an introvert - most of the time and particularly when I am tired. The idea of spending a weekend with a large group of people, couchsurfing and socialising and working together - I enjoy it and I know it will exhaust me at the same time, so that half way through I know I'm going to find it hard to function at my best. As such, I was amused to come across this BuzzFeed \u201c<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/problems-only-introverts-will-understand\">Problems only Introverts will Understand</a>\u201d while still at <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359\">LOTE4: The Stewardship</a>.\n\nLOTE4 was held at the unMonastery in Matera, and was really awesome. The people I met were excellent, friendly and welcoming, and I was more comfortable there than I normally am at intense gatherings, which is a testament to everyone\u2019s openness and the thoughtfulness that had gone into facilitating the event.\n\n<h2>Wondrous variety</h2>\n\nThe experience helped me understand better how I function and prompted some thoughts about group dynamics. First, it's difficult to get space when you don't have a bolt hole. While at LOTE4 I would go into the toilet and as I closed and locked the door, relief flooded me as I got some solace. It reminded me of our motivations behind the design exercise that led to the <a href=\"https://katausten.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/information-overload-the-scape-coat-solution/\">'Scape coat.</a> One thing that might help is having a one-person room ...or 'scape box... that can be occupied with a sign on the outside if the person within would like a little time to get back into themselves.\n\nThe second is that meetings like this are hard to access for people like me who can who struggle to communicate in a group. I am better on a one-on-one basis, at exploring through conversation than proclaiming to a group, which requires delivery of a consolidated point succinctly and confidently. It's just not how I usually talk, which is usually \u201can exploration with\u201d rather than \u201ctalking to\u201d others. In a group situation, I find it useful to have time to go away and think about things, form consolidated ideas and then chime in. I think there is something gained in everyone doing this too - one comes to different conclusions and has different ideas after having space to reflect.\n\nThere isn't usually space for slow thought processes in a conference, or an unConference - there's always too much going on, no time for reflection or repetition. In practical terms, it costs more money (oh that again) to have gaps. But gaps are important. It'd be nice to organise something along these lines where we engineer in gaps for quiet reflection and then return to a topic - not just for people like me, for everyone.\n\n<h2>The strain of society</h2>\n\nThere are a few other things that strike me about this situation of having to get together with people. One is rather tangential and follows a fascinating discussion I recently had with artist <a href=\"http://proboscis.org.uk/\">Giles Lane </a>about a trip he made to Papua New Ginuea to work on story collection with locals there. He told me that the social interaction was so intense it took a long time to decompress afterwards, that it changed how he viewed our everyday activities back home because it showed the complexities of emotional and pragmatic interactions when all aspects your everyday life depends heavily on others with whom you have an unformalised, emotional relationship. For myself I found my understanding of our social interactions was most changed after a trip to Cuba - but for me I saw social interactions being used as a means to press for exchange of things of value.\n\nGetting back to the intensity - it's something from which we have sanitised ourselves in the main in the global west mostly through the medium of money. This is a two-edged sword - it facilitates many things, obviously, and it also removes a lot of tricky obligations that might restrict your ability to look out for your own interests. Living without money requires some degree of moving back to these obligations. Money is a formalisation of trust (something I really only saw clearly after speaking to financial hacking genius Brett Scott). Because there are many things for which we cannot directly barter, without money we need much stronger personal ties to foster enough trust for exchange. Or we need to develop a Zen-like universal trust that removes us from our own worldly wants enough for us not to care about getting something back for our efforts, our own needs, or being taken advantage of.\n\n<h2>Troublesome trust and the issue of not giving back</h2>\n\nThere is a lesson to be learned by extrapolating into experiments in communalism. It has surfaced both in practice for me in doocracies and horizontal sociocratic organisations, and which came up in the discussions of hacking care which we had at LOTE4. It\u2019s around the question of how systems based on these principles deal with people who simply can\u2019t give back. Whether it\u2019s someone in a coma, or with a debilitating disease, or someone who is chronically unwell and thus will never be able to give back as much as they take - in a doocracy, or in a sociocracy, your value is in what you contribute. In some senses in fact that is commodifying someone by their actions. In such cases, I can only think that care will come about from loved ones only - and in this case we are at risk of falling into a trap of going backwards in terms of social care. These problems do arise quite a lot from trust - because most of us would care for someone in need, at least in the short term, if we genuinely believed in their need. But there\u2019s a need for trust so that you don\u2019t feel taken advantage of. The consequences of this is something that people with unseen disabilities often lament, being unable to visibly prove that they are experiencing hardship. A complete inability to give back may be an extreme case, but exploring how we might react to it would I think inform the philosophy behind making doocracies and non-hierarchical organisations more accessible.\n\nPerhaps we in society now need a new strategy for dealing with fostering this kind of trust -something that I think is closely related to this intensity of living. How do we build trust while maintaining some distance - or do we do away with this distance altogether?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-13 12:28:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:23.796482", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1310, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2334, 173, 4, 199, 2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13580, "user_id": 330, "topic_id": 1609, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Cr\u00e9ation officielle : \"Think-tank Edgeryders\"</b>\n\n<strong>Si j'ai bien compris, \\#Lote, il s'agit de :</strong>\n\n<b>Projet EdgeRyders qui est con\u00e7u et parrain\u00e9 par le Conseil de l'Europe et la Commission europ\u00e9enne.

Are you involved in any other initiatives at the moment?\n\nAlso, when I read IoT, I immediately think of user data. @Alberto just made a <a href=\"/t/session-proposal-ethics-and-data-protection-in-citizen-science-open-source-projects/6446\">session proposal</a> for the OpenVillage festival on ethics and data protection.\n\nWould such a session be relevant for you?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-10 14:02:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.020302", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 110, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 2.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85014, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 14570, "post_number": 12, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:10, topic:14570\"]\n> We built an initial support for Cytoscape: https://github.com/RedisGraph/cytoscaperedisgraph \u2013 [Link to the tweet ](https://twitter.com/g_korland/status/1316342988197572608)\n[/quote]\n\nThis is super cool!", "created_at": "2020-10-14 19:32:31.303209", "updated_at": "2020-10-14 19:32:31.303209", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [84969], "is_reply_to": [84969], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39955, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 7789, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\n\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0628\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0631\u062d\u0628 \u0628\u0643 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0629\n\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0632\u0645\u0631\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633.\n\n \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629  \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0641\u0636\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a  \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0643 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0629 \u0647\u064a \u062a\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0631\u0628\u0637\u0647\u0645  \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0648\u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636\u0647\u0645\u0645 .\n\u0644\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643  (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0641\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0647\u0645\u0643\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0643 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0623\u0648 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 :)\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-12-04 10:41:42.907583", "updated_at": "2017-12-04 10:52:52.156423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 82, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 44.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729, 3918], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2324, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2291, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello,\n\nHere is the photo of the tracker I should bring to Matera.\n\nOf course this is only a prototype that won't be used in a production environment.

in Hawaii and would like to make this coffee sorter a reality.  I think there is a lot of value to be created for the global community of coffee growers by creating an inexpensive sorter that can be built in a makerspace.\n\nI'd like to make a rev 1.0 of this machine, then do a sprint here in Hawaii with some of the core members of this team in the fall ( during the harvest ) so we can test out the machine.  I've got plenty of lodging here and am willing to help with airfare for core contributors.\n\nIn keeping with the open source ethos, all drawings, STL files, documentation, software and data will be open and available to the world.  That said, we are building a coffee brand and want to build a machine to help sort our coffee accurately.\n\nHere is our label, in case you're interested.\n\n![xtrafancy|402x690](upload://6o0NFlabXtYoS1WNG4NJJj5chf8.jpeg) \n\nI'm looking forward to meeting with everyone!", "created_at": "2020-03-03 21:09:34.906766", "updated_at": "2020-03-03 21:09:34.906766", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 219, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 674.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4022, 8, 4, 4934, 6483, 6851], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10163, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1414, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Good technique!</b>\n\n<span><span>This</span> <span>is a good technique</span> <span>to test</span> <span>future potential employers</span><span>.

I have taken a risk, and I would like to invoke the experience of <a href=\"/u/sociotechnicalmike\">@sociotechnicalmike</a> and you all to validate it or stop me while there still is (a little) time.\n\nI propose that we say: our research focuses on <em>using</em> collective intelligence well, not on <em>building tools</em> for collective intelligence. So, our first priority is not innovation, but flawless execution. <em>Then</em> we will innovate: specifically, we will innovate on process (co-design by the community as a collective designer); on product (candidate hacker-produced solutions to care problems) on policy implications (careful consideration of scaling incorporating a service design approach) and on network science for collective intelligence (combining ethnography and social network analysis in a richer approach). I guess these four paths to innovation will go in the \"Ambition\" section. But none of that can happen if we don't execute well our convening and our participatory design phase.\n\nI believe this will resonate with Fabrizio's idea of \"no more empty platforms\"; and it is consistent with the question, asked by Nadia at CAPS infoday, of whether a proposal that is \"10% tech innovation and 90% test\" would be well received (he replied \"yes\" \u2013 see the full answer).

The main idea is: we believe we have a solid, fundable concept, and we would like to develop it. So, we propose to finish our proposal and submit it to CAPS anyway. For developing a concept, nothing like hammering it into a formal proposal! If none of our more established academic partners wishes to reconsider their position, Edgeryders is willing to stand as consortium leader. We are far from ideal as a leader (very inexperienced as a company, a bit less so as individuals), but this is the best we can do. In this way:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We honor the time and effort all of us have already put into the proposal.</li>\n\n<li>We advance our thinking around the concept, to the benefit of near future (non-EU) \"plan B\" funding proposals.</li>\n\n<li>We gain the benefit of formal feedback on the proposal from the EU.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAnd who knows \u2013 we might even win! Just today a piece of good news came in from that side: the City of Milano, doing really advanced stuff in the social care space (example: baby-sitting services shared at the neighborhood level, funded by private philantropy, free for low-income households), has expressed interest in joining the consortium. We (Costantino, Zoe and myself) know well the people who do social innovation stuff in the municipality \u2013 they are solid.\n\nHowever, this does mean, at a minimum, a reallocation of writing tasks formerly taken on by KITE.\n\nWe appreciate that you are all busy people, and might decide not to put any more work in the proposal.

I also think Adil would be a great addition. He is calm and generous and having worked with him in Matera, reliable and constructive.\n\nSecond, I wonder if we need more than 2 community directors. If the job is to represent the community and balance out potential misuse of the platform by the company, they need to be able to present enough force that the executive directors must convince at least some of them that the direction they suggest creates value for the community.\u00a0\n\nThird, I would like to step forward to take one of these seats, if granted support.

I have been one of the people who tried to maintain unMonastery presence on the platform and engage in conversation about unMonastery matters, although a lot of the resident unMonasterians were alienated by the unclarity of the relationship between the unMon project, the platform, and the directors.

It was my fault last year that this process was not undertaken and for that I apologise. We are making this process public and open from now on.\n\nVinay Gupta and Asta Helgadottir have been the initial 'community directors' until now.

There is no implied criticism of the current \u201cnon-exec's\u201d here but rather a desire to see a community driven selection process.\n\nApart from guidance and oversight, we ask that the non-exec's commit to each writing a blog-post every other month to keep the community informed (that's 6 blog-posts each) and to come to one physical meeting of the board per annum (at the expense of the company). That's all!\n\nThe bad news is that there is no pay for directors of any kind; non-exec or working.

I wanted to share this for those who are fully clear on the mechanics yet. Below is a simple schematic and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_51GdQ-X3JzN0lqMHVaZVlXMnZ2Z2ZiSlB1WXFCOC1QVnA0/view?usp=sharing\">here's a more detailed vector map</a>.\n\nBasically it comes down to this: for expressing proinsulin, the bacteria needs T7 polymerase (which is a molecule needed for turning DNA into a protein) and a spot to bind to the plasmid DNA. The bacteria has to produce T7 polymerase itself (that's why we need a specific type of bacteria, such as BL21 or TG1, that does this). We control production\u00a0through making the binding spot available or not.\n\nThe T7 polymerase can only bind to the T7 promotor, which leads to production of proinsulin, when the binding spot\u00a0is not repressed. Adding IPTG, which works on the\u00a0\"lac\" part on the plasmid, makes sure the T7 promotor is not repressed. IPTG is our induction agent in this case: when we add it, proinsulin production starts.\n\nThe \"his tag\" is for purification of the protein after it was expressed.\u00a0The amp gene is for\u00a0ampiciline resistance so that when we add ampiciline\u00a0(an antibiotic) to the growth medium, we are sure the surviving bacteria have our plasmid\u00a0(those bacteria that don't have the plasmid are not resistant).\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/88fc5aa3a712092264e487f198184390626cfdf3.jpg\" width=\"280\" height=\"500\">\n\nFinally, we went over the required materials one last time and we're good to go for starting experiments in August when we have access to the lab!\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-20 16:10:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.470426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 316, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30680, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1681, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Mb need some sort of icebreaker?</b>\n\n<span>I feel like we might need some icebreaker/collaborative research project with locals on how they see the unMonastery in the city.

Firstly, I dont think the majority of young Irish people have been spurred in to action. They are currently very dissillusioned with society. The Celtic Tiger promoted an ideal that places value on material wealth and the Irish people subscribed to that ideal. That ideal failed completely and as such it has been hard for the youth to deal with this. Our political and economic system failed us totally and we have not yet found our identity (I could talk for a very long time about Irish identity, our past, our language and other historic factors such as the colonisation but I will stick to the topic). Also, the youth are not being engaged by our social system and as such they are not engaging with society. There are a lot of young Irish people who have strong opinions and ideas but the majority do not act upon them.\n\nThis is a very complex dynamic!\n\n2. The people making a difference are passionate, friendly, they enjoy the simple things in life and they enjoy meeting new people, they are kind-hearted, however, they are not professionals and they often require a lot of advice and guidance in order to make their projects or ideas a success. They act upon local issues. They identify local needs or problems and they come up with solutions to solve or ease the problem. Only lately is the infrastructure emerging to connect and support these individuals, examples include socialentrepreneurs.ie who run networking events and are working to develop a structured network. Social Entrepreneurs Ireland are another organisation, they are a philanthropic body that offer substantial financial and advisory support to ten projects/individuals a year, they also have a youth project called Wave Change, of which I am a part.\n\nFeel free to challenge any of that or ask me further questions :)\n\n\u00a0\n\nR\u00f3n\u00e1n.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-13 11:47:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.944783", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 343, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4292, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 4259, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The unMonastery thrives and prioritises face to face communication, so we\u2019ve decided to begin hosting a series of small informal gatherings in different countries where unMonasterians are present, starting with London - the first one will happen at on the 3rd floor at Royal Festival Hall on Sunday: 26th of April / 10:00 - 12:00.

I didn't have the time to check that. but what i can say is that there are some sheeps/goats little herds in Sidi Kaouiki, wich means there is local farming activity somehow. Is there any self sufficient or partially sufficient food growing farm in the village? I don't know. It could be possible though.\nWe could be impressed by the rural activities and what it offers in terms of self sufficiency, here in europe but anywhere on the planet.\nSo I'm not sad for them. I'm more curious than sad. Here in Europe and in France, we have many words, and actually a whole semantic, to describe local food cycles: locavore, short-circuits (circuits-courts in french), direct and local, etc etc. There? In Morocco for instance? I don't think this semantic applies. Does that mean that they're not into this kind of movement, naturally or not? I do'nt know. I doubt it.\n\n> Here in Europe (especially in Belgium), I guess (for most of us), we don't realize how the chance we have and that some of them in this village doesn't have.\n\nWell, actually, are we that much lucky? We are more than ever overwhelmed under the power of supermarkets and big industrial distribution of overprocessed food.

Taking over <em>facts</em> does not infringe any licence (exception: in the case of database records, for countries having extended copyright to databases; but that's not about pure metadata as here). So, no, I don't think CC-BY-SA licencing of content would have any effects on Edgesense secondary data. It <em>would</em> have effect on Open Ethnographer's secondary data. But if a copyleft \"share alike\" clause is the only \"restriction\", no issue at all. Personally I like both the permissive and copyleft style open licences :)\n\nOn a \"non-commercial\" clause: it is kinda agreed in the software world that \"free\" licencing means not infringing against a use, so a \"non-commercial\" clause means that the licence is no longer open. Accepting unintended use is at the core of being \"open\": both the price one pays for opening ones stuff, and the benefit one gets by being allowed to do everything whatsoever with others' open stuff (if attributing and potentially sharing on, granted). So, I will be a Stallman here \u2026 I'm against non-commercial clauses, IMHO they only do harm in any ecosystem wanting to operate by being open. And besides, I so far could not figure out what they mean: preventing from selling the licenced work, or preventing from using it internally in a company as well?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-08 11:30:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.881571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 295, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19521, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2470, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>I'd like using hacking for upcycling in some cases then:)</b>\n\n:) I suspected this kind of answer.

You will receive the link to the zoom call a day before the event.\n\nMeet HostName, my co-host! We are both food entrepreneurs based in Brussels and together we will share information from the Belgian food scene and abroad, and think about how communities can support food projects.\n\nWe are looking forward to meeting you and welcoming you to our event. Before I go any further, let me tell you a little about Edgeryders - the group that puts these events together.\n\nWhen you join Edgeryders you become part of a community where every time someone shares or posts about a project, like minded peers offer advice or connect it with new information that supports the work of that person. Often it evolves into collaborative projects.\n\nWe build a deep experience that no small group or individual could reach on their own through our dense networks. Having a dense network gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing.\n\nWe join ideas and people to each other, to other knowledge, skills and resources, which means the members of our community gain a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\nSo, ahead of XXX event, we ask that you join the Edgeryders community by signing [up here](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login). Introduce yourself to our community in a New Topic in our [Campfire](https://edgeryders.eu/) and answer some of these questions:\n\n* what kind of solutions do you see that are being tried? are there interesting success stories amidst struggle?\n* is localisation something that can have an actual impact? will it be able to feed the whole table? Is this model based on time and even burning out, higher quality & more involvement scale-able to the whole society?\n* new opportunities for food projects and specifically how cooperative structures can help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!", "created_at": "2020-07-06 16:34:32.723644", "updated_at": "2020-07-06 16:55:44.060372", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 352, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 32.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79990], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4321, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4288, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Two things to make sure we all have:\n\n1.

In other words, car owner can make an account on garaak, promote it as a car owner and add his data, car photos and driver's license to be verified that it is activated. After accepting him/her as a driver, he/she can add trips, choose the number of available chairs and identify the price of the chair. Then the passenger searches and sends a request to the driver to go in the same trip. Thus, the driver or the car owner increases his income without any effort. Moreover, this can help in solving the problem of pollution and traffic and helping the cars owners if they face any sudden failure on the road; he/she can send a request to other drivers, receive a reply and has a specific time in which he receive the help. \n\n----------\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfff3265dd8220c39f7eecc4c144de168ee26a38.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"255\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b9172b41bfbe96461ba184da1dc950cebd9308b2.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9c3434e851aff4741b7a4a4efb94635798c7595.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fbc8d3dc43b64c161927d717cd9948367afa9626.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27d004738a1383f76c83e0ed6feda49066df6a26.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n[text-direction=rtl]\n\n[\u0634\u0631\u062d \u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0641\u0649 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u062c \u0633\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.facebook.com/baladtv/videos/1408714845914129/)\n\n[\u0634\u0631\u062d \u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0641\u0649 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u062f\u0648\u062a \u0645\u0635\u0631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5MeYwMN49Y&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[\u0634\u0631\u062d \u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0627\u064a\u0641](https://www.facebook.com/Garaak.Egypt/videos/711509759051003/)\n\n\u0645\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0638\u0647 \u061f\u061f\n\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u062d\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0627\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0649 \u0645\u0628\u062a\u0643\u0631 \u0648 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0649 \u062a\u0646\u0641\u064a\u0630 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0648 \u062a\u0645 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0647 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0627 \u0648 \u062a\u0634\u062c\u0639 \u0644\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 80 \u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0648 \u062a\u0645 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u0649 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0647 \n\u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0639\u062a \u0645\u0639\u0648\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\n[/text-direction]\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b7ba8987f84aad687f046a7975591cd2941d9144.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd9d8983283075c68e82a962623140ec065bac63.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e5f54f07635dee3ad41ceebc8b03325b2cfade62.jpg\" width=\"667\" height=\"619\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/09cd4c212f9ab4b855a6f41f439e918fe6280b6c.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/17a5ff5413084d6086cc24766e27ca2574672849.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"567\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/727f75023e9e106ecbd120b099dec9ba8b6a4bf0.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b6da6c9cd95f8b4d39f4222b8057ced7283c36cc.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"357\">", "created_at": "2017-08-28 23:01:37.390929", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 10:37:56.886776", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 537, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 3045.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86071, "user_id": 1877, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 173, "raw": "Thank you.

More or less related: as ER LbG is growing, the distinction between organisational communication (which has at least <em>some </em>advertising flavors to it, whether or not we like it) and simply speaking from your own point of view is more worthy of attention, especially when projects are ER LbG projects and not the community's. I think the first one is good for Launch posts, but the latter is more useful if we want to keep the ER LbG in the back as an enabler rather than an active participant in the project. I also find positioning oneself very useful eg stating from what capacity you are writing, and could make for a gentle transition from company to community related opportunities.

Being a child, I wasn't quite so aware of it, but from what I remember hearing in\u00a0conversations between my parents and their expat friends, there was a sense of fear and mistrust in the Chinese system. The cultural communications issue was one worry, but there were also reservations about hygiene and safety standards. In general,\u00a0the\u00a0quality of medical care seemed to be\u00a0perceived\u00a0poorer\u00a0than the Western methods.

Right now i am developing one for a space in Poland - i have submitted two applications already and starting new ones now. I think it would be great to see how each one of us approaches sustainability and vision, ethics and economics, plus adds interesting ideas to the mix. Maybe we could have a call about it?\n\nAbout the progress on the projects - i think there is a lot of issues at hand. First of all, the logistics of the place and ways of bringing supplies. @alex_levene will be writing about food in the space. Another thing to think of. And the shared responsibility for cleanness and repairs. \n\nSecondly, there surely was miscommunication around the bitcut project and lack of a clear idea. Its really important that @islem and @Sofien-Dahem will sharee their insights at some point. The leader of the project didnt tell the rest there is  budget and left the space because he had a wedding in 3 weeks - and two weeks later he is still posting pics of his rrips in morrocco :D he didnt event contact his team and the project is halted. \n\nBut whats optymistic is that @Sofien-Dahem is working on his really brilliant project - he self organised and develops his concept and applies for grants with a bit of my support ;) we have been brainstorming about the idea a couple of times. Wr did the same with Islem, who seems to need a bit more of a guidance, and is quite frustrated about leaving tunis behind to join a project that just stopped. But she is also conceptualising a space shr wants to open and one night we discussed it together and came up with the first business idea for it. I am always up for giving more tips and putting heads together. \n\nSo yeah, seems like a mix of lack of leadership, maybe lack of better programming (some sort of classes, workshops, meetings), bureaucratic obstacles, a lack of vision in case of bitcut, and the lazy vibe of the house are not helping ;) there will be quite some lessons to learn from it.
