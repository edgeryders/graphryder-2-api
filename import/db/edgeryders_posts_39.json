[{"id": 583, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 550, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Crowdfunding's strength is based on <strong>global communities</strong>, right?\u00a0\n\nSo <strong>why focus on\u00a0the local dimension of crowdfunding</strong>?\u00a0Aren't communities thriving, regardless of \"place\"? Since the Internet, people gather because of common interests, not because they share geographical location.\u00a0\n\nHowever, I've been obsessed by a question. As\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2013/03/20/crowdfundings-future-local-online-ecosystems/\">Chance Barnett</a>\u00a0puts it,\u00a0\"there's an essential question I've been thinking about recently that I believe underlies one of the most powerful and transformative possibilities of crowdfunding. The question is... how important is \"local\" to the crowdfunding movement?\"\n\nCrowdfunding is not (only) about money. It's about leveraging on the emotional magma which ties people to projects, causes or businesses. But in certain cases, \"place\" does have an\u00a0impact on emotions. Especially if it's imaginary,\u00a0long gone, missed and beloved. <strong>As homeland is, for emigrants. </strong>Or for people who decide to stay in a given place (or think they cannot leave), but nevertheless engage in projects which are tailored on local assets.\n\n<strong>What happens when you mix\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities\">imagined communities</a>, with\u00a0dreams and aspirations produced locally\u00a0and add web technologies?\u00a0</strong>\n\n<strong>ROMEO</strong> happens.\u00a0\n\n<span>ROMEO is a civic crowdfunding platform which leverages on Italian emigrants' emotional capital\u00a0to support\u00a0projects and initiatives which have a strong impact on specific territories. </span>\n\n<span>I already presented it at the WeDoItaly competition (waiting for the response), but no matter the results, I am determined to pursue the goal. Let me try to share with you the idea... \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The pilot project kicks off in Basilicata: there are more people originally from the region living outside, than people living within its frontiers. Regardless the brain drain, the poor attractivity and the ageing population, there have been some significant initiatives which targeted local change: <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/en/\">Matera 2019</a> is one of them.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Building on the momentum created by Matera's bid being shortlisted within the European Capital of Culture competition, I am convinced that\u00a0in the next 6-7 months we will have to build something irreversible to seed change beyond the \"Capital of Culture\u00a0excuse\". Building the conditions for ROMEO to be launched is one of these irreversible things. </span>\n\n<span>I was wondering: do Edgyeryders want to be part of it?</span>\n\nI know we are all stretched thin, but I was wondering if:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>anyone who had experience in (civic) crowdfunding wanted to share some insights</li>\n\n<li>anyone interested in (eventually) developing the platform (NOT for free) would say \"hey!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOn my side, I am bringing this into the real world, linking it to the Regional office of \"Lucanian diaspora\" and linking it to the Matera 2019 process: but I believe this could be <strong>a perfect joint venture with Edgeryders, interested in finding alternative ways to funding projects with a strong impact on a specific territorial community</strong>.\u00a0\n\nI have more data, but didn't want to bore you further. Toc, toc, anyone has any questions or is interested?\u00a0\n\np.s. if someone reacts, I'll tell the story of the name :-)\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/985f217d8bdeacb129b0248b3e9785306660658f.jpg\" width=\"462\" height=\"260\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-08 00:27:14", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 16:34:57.771321", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 636, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19982, "user_id": 3396, "topic_id": 736, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Thanks guys</b>\n\nAlex, this is so nice to hear, please stay in touch and let's push things forward...

At this point, often some junior minister or high-ranking civil servants sees an opportunity (if only for his or her own career) and helps a bit. So, with time and a constructive narrative, civic hacking can create the conditions for full-on open and smart government.\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-15 07:50:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.972880", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 411, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25829], "is_liked_by": [1861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4508, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4475, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The attached files contain a template for manually creating a small network barter deal during a presentation, barcamp session or other social gathering.

Stewardship is the act of taking care, preserving, maintaining, the \"gardening of an ecology\".\u00a0Stewards are working towards the common good. They are creating new social architecture, in order to enable collaboration and getting the best out of each individual. Stewards challenge the hierarchy (they promote a decentralized, lateral architecture) and challenge the models based on ownership. Also\u00a0the process of stewardship is as important as the outcomes, as well as the way decisions are taken are more important that the decisions themselves.\n\nExtracts from comments and thoughts from <a href=\"/u/danohu\">@danohu</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/elviapw\">@elviapw</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/patrick_andrews\">@Patrick_Andrews</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>\u00a0,\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Communities and stewardship</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nCommunity (as a gathering, as a feeling, as a platform) is the core pillar for stewardship concept. Communities, and not individuals, are seen as ideal stewards. This is connected to the idea of shared responsibility, distributed consciousness, trust.\u00a0If community is understood as a platform, it should not be just a platform, it needs to serve people.\u00a0Communication is vital, between peers, between communities, on politics and policy level. People need to be dependent on each other.\u00a0\n\nExtracts from comments and thoughts from <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/patrick_andrews\">@Patrick_Andrews</a>, <a href=\"/u/vgratian\">@vgratian</a>, <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>, <a href=\"/u/rmchase\">@rmchase</a>, <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Challenges of stewardship methodology and how to build resilience</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOne of the main issues about stewardship is gathering knowledge that is dispersed, thus documentation is key. Documentation is also important to share the knowledge\u00a0thus insure the resilience of the community.\u00a0But then how do you share the knowledge within the community, without imposing it as a rule? Problems can stem from the creation of umbrella models to address problems that are universal.\u00a0\n\nResilience is achieved through heterogenity: people with complementary skills that reach out into different networks.Resilience is\u00a0also achieved through communities rather than single persons:\u00a0a single person can burn-out quickly and \u00a0lose motivation while working for the benefit of the whole community single handedly, while in a community the burden is shared, and stewards are interchangeable.\n\nStewardship is a daily work and requires a lot of commitment, acting as a steward requires self-sacrifice and even transgressing rules. The risks are manifold for achieving impact, from mismanaging expectations or resources (not enough eyeballs), to loss of reliability (achieving growth by compromising) or even burnouts (\u2018temporary ownership is an aspect of precarity\u2019, notices one of the stewards).\u00a0It is easy to lean on stewards, and once you start stewarding something, everybody expects you to do a lot more.\u00a0We need to better support and reward stewards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nExtracts coming from: <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/elviapw\">@elviapw</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"/u/danohu\">@danohu</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Precarious conditions of stewards</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nStewardship is a daily work and requires a lot of commitment, acting as a steward requires self-sacrifice and even transgressing rules.

Imi salta sufletul de bucurie cand vad ca oamenii isi dau mana sa construiasca un bine tot mai mare. Mi-era dor sa simt emotiile astea vizavi de \"puterea lui impreuna.\" \n\nEu sunt Liviu, si un capitol foarte important din viata mea incepe in 2011, cand am intrat in echipa <a href=\"http://www.gomentorship.ro/resurse/\">GOmentorship</a>, platforma de mentorat profesional. Acolo a fost startul meu in Community management. Moderam discutii in domeniul Educatiei si Antreprenoriat, abordam mentori, contribuiam cu resurse si asa mai departe.\n\nChestia asta m-a prins asa tare incat ce-a fost dupa si ce este se invarte in jurul comunitatilor, majoritatea in domeniul educatiei si antreprenoriatului. \n\nAm fost 2 ani parte din Link Education And Practice (ONG ce aduce impreuna universitati, studenti si mediul privat), prilej cu care am co-creat cu organizatiile din 4 orase, Zilele Educatiei NonFormale.\n\nO perioada scurta am fost implicat in community management pentru 2 platforme din UK (WYGU si Brave New Talent).\n\nIn 2013 am pornit impreuna cu niste oameni foarte frumosi comunitatea studento-profesorilor <a href=\"http://blog.invatasa.ro/despre-noi/\">InvataSa</a>. Oricine practic putea sa-si impartaseasca pasiunea prin workshopuri practice, de maxim 4 ore. Tot din 2013, am intrat in AIESEC Bucuresti (unde inca tin traininguri ocazional), si in <a href=\"http://universitateaalternativa.ro/\">Universitatea Alternativa</a>. Aici, acum, sunt 'ghid' si pun umarul la dezvoltarea educatiei in Romania si in lume. \n\nCred ca putem crea intr-adevar un impact major doar daca suntem impreuna. Asa ca asta ma preocupa - cum ne adunam sa construim. In retele mici intai. Ele unite, se fac mai mari, si usor usor, atingem toata lumea.\n\nDaca vorbim de comunitati, cel mai greu la inceput mi s-a parut crearea de 'awareness'. Oamenii trebuie sa aiba un motiv pentru care sa ciuleasca urechile la ceva nou, sa participe, si apoi sa ramana. Una din cele mai bune metode momentan mi se pare efectiv - a face lucruri pentru si cu un numar mic de oameni, care creste treptat. Toti vrem sa fim de ajutor, sa contribuim, important e sa fie primele rezultate. Da, necesita rabdare si ambitie. Ca in orice de altfel. Dar se poate :)\n\nVizavi de oameni care vor sa schimbe ceva in comunitati - nu doar ca-i avem si aici, dar lista este lunga. Parem putini, dar suntem de fapt foarte multi. Trebuie sa stim insa unii de altii mai des, si cred ca e deja un prilej cu EdgeRyders.\n\nSunt multe de spus, mai multe de demonstrat. Eu sunt gata sa plecam in calatoria asta provocatoare dar foarte frumoasa!\n\nCu drag si bucurie,\nLiviu", "created_at": "2015-05-20 21:12:28", "updated_at": "2018-04-14 14:35:25.258224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1157, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1124, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b21762866db91bb113212dae6303006870ab1cf2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"><br>\n\nThis weekend marked our second trip to Matera, the city set to host the first unMonastery \u2013 those in attendance were myself, Alberto, Nadia and Mike (Levitt) \u2013 in addition we were hosted by the MT2019 team and our new and indespensible collaborator Andrea Paoletti (who's both an EdgeRyder and runs <a href=\"http://benetural.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Casa Neutral</a> in Matera).</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>Our first day (Friday) was focused on Mike's role in mapping our future home, utilising a low cost technique involving a laser measure, DSLR and google sketchup, we hatched a plan to render the building as a downloadable model. Run as a small workshop with around 10 individuals from Matera including architects tasked with refitting the builoding \u2013 the intention was to produce a model for remote and distributed collaboration; the model, details of the event and the tutorial produced will be summarised in another post later next week. The blogpost you're reading however is aimed at reporting on the overall progress of the project, setting out the challenges, sharing what we learned this weeked and putting the next steps in motion.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>The core aim for the Saturday event was to build on and bore down into the outcomes from the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmon-matera-co-design-13-today-we-have-given-you-a-big-gift\" target=\"_blank\">first co-design session in March</a>, our approach was three fold. Firstly we sought to narrow down and expand on the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/challenges-on-the-ground-unmonastery-in-matera\" target=\"_blank\">43 challenges</a> compiled last time by local participants into 10 concrete challenges, so that projects housed at the unMonastery can begin to respond directly to real needs. Secondly we aimed to co-write the international call, taking into account the main challenges highlighted as a criteria for submission.\n\nThe final part of the session was focused on imagening the possibilities of the space and asking those present \"What kind of space do you want unMonastery to be?\", \"What needs can it meet spatially?\", \"Should we provide an open door policy that welcomes anyone in the local area in at anytime?\", \"Should there be a fixed schedule and weekly timetable of events?\", \"Should focus be on co-working or something else?\" - these were some of the questions raised.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>It's important to say now this event was no walk in the park, throughout the course of the weekend we learnt many things. Perhaps one of the most prescient lessons was that creating space in Matera for events and happenings isn't the real problem but rather getting people to attend and contribute to events that rely on co-production is the most difficult task. This probably sounds obvious but after the success and reception of the first event I personally thought we might be onto a good thing, being able to create continual traction with each event staged, this was a slight misjudgement. Instead of the 30+ strong crowd from last time, numbers were thinner on the ground \u2013 in part though this could be attributed to other events taking place in the city at the same time.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>Regardless of numbers there was enough of us to form two seperate groups of around 6-8 and take on the challenges task, which has resulted in us now having 14 critical and more clearly defined challenges that Materans believe the unMonastery could begin to tackle. I've broken out this list into a seperate thread in order to fuel focused discussion on this specific area.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><strong>Challenges Post</strong></font></font></font></h4>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/summary-challenges-matera\" target=\"_blank\">Available Here</a></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bdd2700818317cf685eaa6e649985ac27097e102.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\"><br>\u200b\n\nWhich leads us onto our second task, co-writing the international call and perhaps at this point it's fair to say things began to unravel a bit but early on in the process we managed to capture a number of key requirements, including the information pack which Alberto has <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/the-unmonasterians-guide-to-matera-a-draft\" target=\"_blank\">created the first iteration for</a>. Again in order to maintain focused discussion the international call and evaluation process has been forked into a seperate thread.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<h4 class=\"western\"><span>International Call Post</span></h4>\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/summary-for-international-call-matera\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>Available Here</span></font></font></font></a>\n\n<span>Around the stage of shifting from co-writing the international call and migrating into co-designing the space we started to suffer from a loss of structure, the timeline for the call was looking exceptionally tight and slightly unmanagable. Add to this it was already late in the day and we'd been going strong since the morning, we began to get down to the nitty gritty of preparing the space to be livable and it was with this that a new set of problems were introduced \u2013 would the building be ready for September?</span>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>I think it's important to pause for a moment and reflect.\n\nOne of the key lessons that has permeated the projects progress so far in Matera is that building trust is the hardest task, particularly in Matera, crossing the cultural devide not just between languages but between practice is even harder still. The 'we can do this but only if we work together' attitude that characterises EdgeRyders and other projects that each of us are involved in is a difficult thing to share, particularly when your offer isn't exactly crystal clear \u2013 and this is something the unMonastery project needs to solve, and fast, in order to move forward.\n\nAnd it was this combination of thought, timelines and trust, that gave rise to a new plan this weekend gone, aimed at building bridges of understanding, increasing capacity and beginning to reciprocate what Matera has given to us so far.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>This new plan however is a big change - unMonastery will not be opening in September of this year, we've decided to push back the launch date to February 2014. This sudden re-evaluation of timescales comes with good reason, firstly there are hoops to be jumped through, as the process of refitting the building is not a simple one, it involves many stakeholders including local government. Secondly the timeline for the international call, the process required when public money is at stake requires that we be rigourous and fair in our evaluation of applicants, which means more time than anticipated. Since this is the prototype we want to try and get things right the first time and it's safe to say we're learning many useful lessons along the way that can help support other peoples projects in the future.\n\nOne key recommendation emerging from this process so far, (thanks to Nadia): When engaging with multiple stakeholders with a project of this nature, establish an organasational chart from the start with those you're working with that illustrates responsibilies, the chain of command and a clear decision making process.</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>So with that said, what's the good news? The answer lies in the question: how do we build bridges, capacity and begin to give back to Matera in advance of the opening? The plan: a two week unconference/festival with a combined effort between unMonastery, EdgeRyders and other interested parties in October./November. Myself and Nadia have begun to layout a rough plan for how this might happen and we'll be to meeting soon, we'll save more details for another post but if you'd like to get involved at this early stage email us: ben@unmonastery.eu / nnegash@unmonastery.eu</span></font></font></font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial\"><font><span>And that's it for now, we'll be setting out a plan over the coming weeks for this long form unconference, putting out the international call, updating the website, putting the 3d model online \u2013 all feedback and thoughts across the details covered in this post are greatly appreciated.\u00a0</span></font></font></font>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-28 11:56:33", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:28:18.901344", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1568, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1638, "user_id": 1057, "topic_id": 1605, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/interagir.jpg\" title=\"\">\n\n<strong>Framing of problem</strong>\u00a0 Few projects to date have attempted to develop open government participation and collaboration from a global perspective. The Global Citizenship project has sought to define what could be a global citizenship, free of geographic boundaries, and what this would mean for citizens from around the world. This project however has lacked support and was abandoned. Some platforms have succeeded in engaging citizens on global issues, like OPENideo. CitizensLab is a venture of Government in the Lab, with a mission to unite citizens around the world to create a better future.\n\nSince the Open Government Partnership initiative was jointly launched by the USA and Brazil last September, nearly 60 countries have signed the Open Government Partnership declaration and about a dozen of them are working on an open government plan to be delivered to the OGP. It is a top-down approach.\n\n<strong>Value proposition / Short definition</strong> \u00a0An online community built upon a shared vision, a shared purpose, can thrive when it is complemented by open and respectful collaboration.\n\n<strong>Features</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Onefocused upon positive transformation: a community that could create an engaged and active citizenry focused on improvement for all.</li>\n\n<li>Consider the Edgeryders experimental project as in its infancy, a global platform to focus on global problems, inspired by the Edgeryders model, and exploring more themes and global issues.</li>\n\n<li>Examples of possible themes: Peace (world military spending, racism, unrests, wars), global economy (financial crisis, causes of poverty), environmental issue (global warming, cataclysms), food and agriculture (famine, food production), sustainable development, global aid, global governance, etc.</li>\n\n</ul><strong>For whom</strong> \u00a0Citizens of the world, from all countries\n\n<strong>Value for citizens</strong> \u00a0An expression of different and evolving cultures and languages, bridging separate culture and national identities. An unparalleled instructive and explorative opportunity to participate and collaborate to bringing solutions to global problems.\n\n<strong>Value for governance</strong>\u00a0 Understanding people\u2019s aspirations. Possibility of alignment between governments\u2019 actions and the multiple contributions from citizens. A range of possible results of government actions:\u00a0 economic, political, social, strategic, quality of life, ideological, and stewardship.\n\n<strong>Why is it different</strong>\u00a0\u00a0 Although the bold and ambitious Open Government Partnership is growing in membership, and making progress, there is still a need for grass-root based open government initiatives with a focus on collaboration. What is different in this project is that it has never been done before. Edgeryders being a pioneer of open government collaboration, this project would seek to explore how citizens can contribute to collaborate with governments to solve global issues.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-12 04:08:49", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 00:52:41.501728", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 481, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6427, "user_id": 3708, "topic_id": 6394, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>I\u2019d like to propose a session around a recent new project \u2013 the </span><a href=\"https://github.com/DIYScience/DIYScience\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>DIY Science Network</span></a><span> \u2013 with a lot of parallels with Opencare.

We\u2019ve grown a really amazing community of passionate and talented interdisciplinary folks and we\u2019d love to be able to develop some more ambitious civic or cultural projects. But we\u2019re already at the limit of what we can achieve as volunteers. It\u2019s a classic Catch 22 volunteer trap \u2013 we need money to buy us more time, but we don\u2019t have enough time to work on finding money. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>THE PROBLEM</span>\n\n<span>From talking to friends in the wider network of DIY and community-based science projects (many related to issues of care) it seems this is a very common problem. From diybio community labs and bioart collectives, to civic environmental monitoring projects, to patient activism groups, to interdisciplinary science hacking communities \u2014 we all face similar challenges in growing and maintaining ourselves as sustainable civil society initiatives. </span>\n\n<span>Finding the right balance to sustain a healthy community, share knowledge, and support co-creation is hard. And funding around grassroots citizen science can be particularly challenging, if not unfair: researchers that study us receive more funding than we do ourselves. And, whilst large amounts of public science funding are allocated to \u2018citizen science\u2019 at the both European and National levels, there is very little possibility for non-institutional citizen science communities to access it. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>JOINING FORCES: THE DIY SCIENCE NETWORK</span>\n\n<span>The </span><a href=\"https://github.com/DIYScience/DIYScience\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>DIY Science Network</span></a><span> has grown out of a number of conversations around these topics.

It is a meta network between DIY science initiatives: part \u2018P2P: sharing best practices\u2019 and part \u2018advocacy for access to public research funding\u2019. So far most of the work we\u2019ve done has been about growing the network and finding our identity. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d8b004edf753bd59f197b2c281e6789a37919738.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\">\n\n</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>OUR PROGRESS</span>\n\n<span>We took part in the </span><a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Mozilla Global Sprint</span></a><span> earlier this month with a focus on the P2P side of the project. However, for now we think the priority should really be to get an advocacy platform up and running as soon as possible in the hope that we might still be able to have some influence on agenda setting for FP9. In the short term we hope soon to secure funding to gather 4-5 European community/project organisers together for a co-design sprint to lay the foundation for the network \u2013 describe our identity, values, mission, begin to craft our advocacy arguments and roadmap next steps \u2013 and build a basic website.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>At \\#Openvillage, we would like to keep our focus on the advocacy side of the project:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>MAIN CHALLENGE</span>\n\n<span>How do we encourage funders to support DIY science initiatives now? And, longer term, how can we foster a funding culture that is supportive of non-institutional science?</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>What kind of funding do we need? (fellowships? core funding? project funding?) and how much?</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>There is a lot of perceived risk in funding non-institutional projects, especially at the European level where so many stakeholders are involved. How to we allay those fears? What about ethics committees, scientific advisory boards, financial controlling...?</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>How can the impact of our projects be evaluated?</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>Does it make sense to work with intermediary organisations (fiscal sponsors) who manage the distribution of smaller funds (Individual DIY science initiatives are not usually looking for EC-scale funding budgets - think \u20ac1000s or \u20ac10 000s rather than \u20ac100 000s or \u20acmillions.), provide training/project co-design, mitigating risk for the funding bodies? </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>Is public funding even the way to go? E.g. Would be we better off concentrating on changing the culture of science-funding foundations to encourage them to support DIY science?</span> Should we be working on developing our own business models? ...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>As yet we don\u2019t have a clear idea for a format for \\#openvillage - it will depend on what stage we are at by the time of the festival. But in general, we are very open to talk about how to bring in this topic in the most constructive way possible for everyone. </span>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-19 18:04:10", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:05:56.921662", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2353, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 31.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22878, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4117, "post_number": 16, "raw": "i just realised that there were two points i'd forgotten to make.\n\nIf a solution exists in the commercial environment, it's a problem for which the solution already exists.

It deals with clinical practice in the Amish communities of America. The Amish faith dictates they vet very carefully any innovation for stuff that could introduce perverse incentives in their lives. They prize something they call \"autonomy\": electricity, for example, can be bad if it powers activities that will make people drift away from the community, but it's OK for, say, lighting your workplace. What's\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0OK is the electric grid, which means now the community is coupled to the broader world in a way the Amish find troubling. This is why the Amish have solar panels.\n\nAutonomy in health care has a number of very interesting implications.\u00a0\n\nhttp://digg.com/2016/amish-medicine-mosaic\n\nHere are some highlights (but do yourselves a favour and read the whole thing).\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The Amish refuse to have insurance. \"When someone gets sick, the church collects alms to help the patient cover expenses.\"</li>\n\n<li>This might happen at a time when the community has other objectives as well (\"setting up a farm for a young couple\"). You can ask of the community to support your treatment, but its\u00a0costs are not simply discharged into an anonymous \"system\": they are borne by your own brothers and sisters. As a result, everyone focuses on not spending more money than is necessary, and\u00a0\"[Amish] communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention\".</li>\n\n<li>For this reason, the Amish use genetic screening of children. Prevention is so important that its benefits trump the disadvantages of dealing with the world at large.</li>\n\n<li>They develop their own treatments (one for burns is described in the article). They navigate, with some difficulties, the interface with the mainstream medical world: clinical testing etc. These treatments tend to be very cheap.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Communities negotiate discounts, which hospitals are willing to offer in exchange for payment in full at the time of service. In one example (a child treated with surgery for colon cancer) price was negotiated down to 19,000 USD from 172,000, a 90% discount. \"For Americans with health insurance, it may come as a surprise that hospital costs are negotiable\".\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The Amish don't sue. \"When the Amish told [a doctor]\u00a0they understand doctors are human and make mistakes, he had to pause to let that sink in. To them, he was not simply a member of the medical establishment, but an autonomous individual doing his best, given the choices and information before him.\"\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAll of which plays well into @Lakomaa's and @Tino_Sanandaji's institutional model of health care.\n\nI propose we roll out a challenge on autonomy and responsibility. What are people doing to be less dependant on state- and private sector provided health care? Are they helping each other? Is there prevention going on? Dietary tips circulating, sports clubs to help people stay motivated to work out? Yoga, meditation? I believe there are massive links there. It's quite likely that the returns on prevention are quite high!\u00a0\n\n@Nadia ?\n\n@Noemi ?\n\n@markomanka ?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-25 09:06:44", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:20:00.497298", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 555, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 131.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3804], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11892, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 4374, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>can u try again</b>\n\nIt is working for me. just tried it. can you try again now\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-11 11:47:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.158764", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9923], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22634, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2046, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>No, I don't know of anyone being involved yet.</b>\n\n.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-15 10:20:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.856041", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22185], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23041, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6277, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Not really.

The Council of Europe was originally mentioned by Winston Churchill in 1943 - the push was towards European integration to remove the fundamental economic drivers of centuries of wars. A Common Market was designed to create a Europe which would rise together, reducing competition inside of the Eurozone and promoting cooperation and peace. But the strains of economic and social justice are shaking the foundations of European integration. Charles de Gaulle said, 50 years ago,<strong> \"Oui, c\u2019est l\u2019Europe, depuis l\u2019Atlantique jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019Oural, c\u2019est toute l\u2019Europe, qui d\u00e9cidera du destin du monde\"</strong> (Europe, from the Ocean to the Urals, will decide the destiny of the world) and now we're discussing whether the Greeks or the Germans will quit the Euro first! What happened?</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The \"<strong>government commons</strong>\" between the Nation States of Europe was designed as a Common Good, with any rivalries being small when set against the benefits from the sharing of a currency, a system of laws and trade, and a shared vision of the future. The idea was that the European Project would, in time, become so valuable that not even the most extreme would risk it to political unreasonableness. A shared good, once thought of as only a Common Market, held as a surety against competition, conflict and war.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>But those were the years of growth, the post-WW2 boom years in which the global economy ran hot on cheap raw materials, the post-WW2 bloom, and the suppression of petty conflicts which the Cold War brought about. Without the Soviet Union as an enemy from the outside herding the Western Powers together, with arguments about how to divide up a shrinking pie, rather than the optimism of \"wealth for all\" from 30 or 50 years of compounded growth in assets... the European Commons is in trouble because as economies begin to hit freefall, some people are turning from <strong>cooperating to make a bigger pie for everybody to competing to secure as much of the pie as possible for themselves</strong> and those like them. Carving out the biggest possible slice of the Common Good and dragging it back to your own country is madness in the good times because the rest of the pie continues to grow without you, but in a declining market, grabbing as much as you can of what's good, building a wall around it, and cutting ties to sinking ships seems like wisdom, at times.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And it's this split, between <strong>cooperative and competitive</strong> relationships between people which the internet reveals as being fundamentally subject to political and technical biases. We can work together on the internet, but we can't hurt each-other (very much) and the result is a place in which creative cooperation is easy, destructive competition is hard, and the rules make the game.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A single currency is like an internet for trade, but the problem with scarcity-based economic instruments is that if there's an imbalance in the system, they tend to make it worse over time as interest compounds, investments pay off and debts grow and accumulate. A global internet is inherently more stable than a European currency.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The Euro is a commons, but it's a commons which is subject not just to the \"tragedy of the commons\" but the far more destructive \"tragedy of positive feedback\" in which <strong>winner-keeps-winning industrial-style capitalism</strong> meets the very real need for <strong>a</strong> <strong>single currency to operate within a single polity</strong>, a single people, without such sharp split into rich nations and poor nations that <strong>what's good for one is bad for the other</strong>. An example is inflation - a little often aids poor nations, but even that much is often very toxic to wealthy nations as it dilutes their gains. By creating a Currency Commons, Europe <strong>shares more at a governmental level than it does at a social or economic one.</strong>\n\n</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\n\n<strong>And this is the crux of our European dilemma.</strong> How to manage the fact that the idea from the architects of the European Union was,<strong> from the top down, to lead the European people to a closer union</strong>, based in part on the American model, in a time ill-suited to megaprojects, in which even the American union is in trouble as splits between Democrat and Republican become vast gulfs. How then are we to share a currency and law, when other unions peel apart around us? (the Soviet Bloc being the first)</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>This may seem like a big, abstract question, but it affects all of us. It's a question of identity, a question of scope, goals and interests. <strong>A previous generation of political elites decided it was a good idea for Europe to pull together as a single team</strong>, de Gaulle thought the \"destiny of the world\" depended on it, and here we are - with the best tools ever invented for connecting people across continents, and a real opportunity to assume the position of global leadership which America is throwing away with its appalling imperialism and human rights record, to actually demonstrate some of the virtues and values which are at the heart of European culture in a time when America is abandoning them (habeas corpus) - with all this potential, <strong>will we choose to pull together as Europe, not from the top-down as Churchill and de Gaulle envisaged, but from the bottom up, connected, online and unified</strong>.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The alternative seems stark, and in an age where government's ability to manage difficult social problems is at an all-time low and the power of the people is at an all time high, it seems reasonable to ask a question:<strong> is European culture strong enough to support, survive and manage the difficulties caused by the likely failure of European currency</strong>. Yet the European project has largely survived the European Union / European Economic Area divides, it's survived the cat-at-the-door British and their obnoxious, told-you-so Pound, and if managing the economic splits between Germany and Greece requires two currencies or a two-economy Europe, is it possible that We The People have gotten enough out of the European Project to take up the slack and<strong> continue to run Europe as a Common Purpose, not a Common Market</strong>.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>This is the key question: does the declining power of the State to deliver, with the inevitable transfer of power from the top to the bottom, from the Hierarchies to the Networks, enhance or weaken European unity? Do the people of Europe now want integration more than the political elites do?</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I believe this may be the case, particularly when the question is broken down to its real consequences: no more working abroad, no more single currency, no more casually roaming around the continent to the university of your choice, no more freedom to be anywhere you like over a huge continent. <strong>Penned back in our countries and second class citizens everywhere else? I think the universal response is \"no thanks!\"</strong>\n\n</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>Europe is a Commons, but is it a Commons of the Governments, or is it now the Commons of the People. Is it Their Europe or Our Europe?</strong></div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I am a European. The luxury of having an entire Continent to call home was one of the major advantages of being in America, and I think there's a very, very good case to be made for the simple idea that the middle class intellectual elites of Europe have followed the lead from the top-down and unified and integrated. Our friends are all over the continent, many of us visit for months and work in other countries, and the idea of unwinding that liberalism seems absurd. Of course, before WW1 you could travel without a passport from the Mediterranean to Moscow so it's not as if history only moves in one direction, but we're here at a cross-roads, and I hope we have the wisdom to say,</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>This is our Europe, our Nation-of-Nations, our Continent, and we'll travel freely, work freely and make our friends where we choose, not where an arbitrary border gets in the way. And you, the politicians, the political actors, can sort out the details on how we keep our Continent, and don't revert back to weak, squabbling countries, incapable of steering the destiny of the world as de Gaulle foresaw.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The future is also a commons, and we have a part to play in it, together.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>-----</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/\">EdgeRyders</a> project started at Council of Europe as an experiment in making policy at Internet Scale, asking whether a process like WikiPedia could create meaningful insight and input into decision-making at a political level. \u00a0It's important that it works, and to make it work, we need your input and your ideas.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\n\n<strong>Council of Europe is listening.\u00a0</strong>I'm normally very sceptical of government-led consultation processes, usually they're about rubber-stamping a plan with public consent, but in this case, the desire to listen is completely genuine.

That there is something worth exploring further with Elf\u2019s moneyless experiment. It relates to something I read in David Graeber\u2019s Debt: the first 5000 years. Part of it related to exploring, or rediscovering rather, an understanding of human relations and interactions that doesn\u2019t reduce them to transactions: this in exchange for that. The other part is the value of this kind of initiative in general. Let me start with the second.\n\nWe hitched a ride with 4 cars, the first to pick us up were two brothers on their way to Frankfurt. I walked up to them said hi and explained that we are hitchhiking to Berlin, and are they going in that general direction... a few minutes later we were in the car and the conversation was rolling. I won\u2019t get into details but the trajectory of the conversation was \u201cwhat do you do\u201d, then \u201cyou can\u2019t save the world or change the system\u201d ending with \u201cok I think you guys and what you\u2019re doing is cool and I\u2019m a software developer, let me know if I can help on one of your projects- I try to contribute to the open source community when I can\u201d. Next we hitched a ride with two friends from Freiburg who were headed to Kassell to perform at an a-capella choir event. They also have a hip hop band:\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/image01.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext up Elf managed to connect with pair, man and woman, who were driving from Frankfurt heading in the direction of Berlin. They were quite stylish and in a flashy car so I just assumed they are a well-off couple on their way back home to a stylish apartment in an upmarket part of Berlin. I was wrong. They are colleagues working for a door manufacturing company based in a small town a few hours outside Gdansk. During the 3 hr car ride we had a lot of time to talk about all kinds of things. Elf did most of the talking as he had to translate from Polish to English in addition to just speaking for himself (if you\u2019re not sociable, forget about hitchhiking). They asked us about ourselves and we described what Edgeryders and \\#lote was about and I think Elf described his \\#moneyless initiative. I was curious about their lives and asked a lot of questions. We discussed differences in lifestyles and it\u2019s clear that a lot of what Elf said resonated with them on some level. We talked about all kinds of stuff.\n\nOn dropping us off at the gas station, the lady and I had a conversation while waiting for the counter ( I was waiting for a refill of my water bottle) and she was paying for something. I found out that they had driven over 1000 km in three days to go to a meeting with a potential new client based in Germany, and that this is pretty expensive. Apparently like myself she travels alot and seldom has time to spend outside airports, train stations and hotels while on business trips. Just before heading off into the car she came back and gave me a hug and kiss saying that we were building the future. I think I\u2019ve made a new friend.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/image00.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 533px;\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nI now know more about what it is Elf does: he\u2019s building tools and setting an example to enable cultural change. The way he does is by putting himself out there and living in a future he wants to be a part of. And by doing so he is contributing towards it happening. By simply taking its different components out of the realm of the unimaginable and putting them into the realm of the possible. This opens doors to spaces we didn\u2019t didn\u2019t know existed. In our environments but also within ourselves. I feel it everytime I am inspired by people I meet to try something new to me and this shared trip with Elf was one of them. And it\u2019s not even over yet!\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to go dumpster diving together before I leave Berlin :) I experienced a \u201clight\u201d version of it yesterday when we passed by a dumpster on our way to Ela\u2019s place (also on Edgeryders) where I am staying while in town. Elf salvaged a couple of packages of really high quality milk from bins outside an organic food shop. I thought it would be a much bigger deal, the food looked fine and it\u2019s hard to justify this kind of waste of a valuable resource so it\u2019s a pleasant discovery that to my surprise I didn\u2019t have an issue with it. Apparently in Germany salvaging food that could be made use of this way is criminalised (\u201ctheft of private property\u201d). I would like to know more about the reasoning and whether it is the same in other parts of Europe. And whether someone has come up with some kind of legal hack to get around the restrictions?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/TwDeotNdeTo\n\nAfter the trip I have a different understanding of what Elf does than the one I had before we set off.

I really have no time to do it, but I want to do it anyway.)</em>\n\nI am a knowledge worker. I spend most of my day interacting (mostly online) with other humans to produce and manipulate information into knowledge. So, to a first approximation, the skills I use everyday are reading, writing, summarizing, researching. I use English a lot, French occasionally. I read and write budgets and contracts. I occasionally deploy math (game theory, or graph theory, or run-of-tjhe-mill calculus) to decode a theoretical model. But that does not tell you very much: it is just a cloud of skills. I believe they can be grouped into just three high-level skills, which are my indispensable tools of the trade.\n\n<img alt=\"Making a difficult decision with storytelling\" src=\"http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/1900000/Morpheus-Red-or-Blue-Pill-the-matrix-1957140-500-568.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 309px; float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\">\n\nThe first one is <strong>storytelling</strong>. Cognitive science tells us humans think in terms of stories, and solve the uncertainties implied by inhabiting a rapidly changing world by framing their situation as a story (picked from a rather small repertoire of archetypes), and themselves as a character in that story. Suppose you have to decide whether to choose between a safe, perhaps slightly boring professional path and a more high-risk, but socially relevant one. Computing probabilities is impossible, you just don't know the full range of implications of your choice. But you do know you are like Neo in <em>Matrix</em>, and Morpheus is right there offering you to choose between a blue and a red pill, so the choice becomes obvious. You are The One, that's your path, and that's the end of it.\n\nThe ability to tell stories unlocks the power to steer your career and your life. For example, it unlocks fundraising: unless you are doing standardized stuff, people will fund you because they recognize a story, and their role in that story is to support you. In an older project of mine, <a href=\"http://progettokublai.ning.com\">Kublai</a>, I persuaded the Ministry of Economic Development in Italy to do a very advanced project because they bought into the narrative of the \"helpful (central) State\", reaching out to work with citizens rather than against them. I try to narrativize every important thing that I do: all important professional projects, but also stuff like moving to a different country (which I did, more than once).\n\nThe second ability I will call <strong>divination</strong>. By this I mean a stance which combines formal analysis with a humble approach, that downplays the role of individual people and organizations in the unfolding of things. The personality of the CEO is important in a company, but even more important are market conditions, corporate culture, long-term trends like globalization. Many powerful people feel they are not powerful at all, and that they really are in the hands of the organizations they are supposed to lead, or just those of the next turn of events. So, divination for me means rummaging into society, looking for causes and for forces to align with, in the countless interactions we engage in every day. This ability unlocks analysis: once you have it, you are not going to delude yourself that, if just the Prime Minister changed her mind, everything would be different. It also disqualifies conspiracy theories and the need for people to blame (the politicians, the banks, the media). \n\nThe third ability is <strong>forgiveness</strong>. By this I mean the deep acceptance that there is no point in pushing people to conform to a certain standard: people are what they are, and it is more constructive to try to find out what they are good at and organize activities around them rather than bend them around activities (which is mostly impossible anyway). I once worked with a young man who was crazy. I don't mean he was odd: I mean he was constantly negotiating illness. At one point he was forcibly hospitalized and put on medication with a pretty heavy psychiatric diagnosis. And yet, this person is a brilliant coworker in the kind of projects I tend to be involved in. He works superhard. He is the best connector ever. He always has time for people, and he tends to be online and available about 16 hours a day. Mind you, he is not brilliant <em>despite </em>being ill: he is brilliant <em>because </em>he is ill. He is obsessive, and if you channel his obsession he becomes a happy, well functioning overachiever. Of course, he is not good at everything, but then neither am I, or anyone. This ability unlocks management: once you let go of standards you can get down to the real work, which is to design environments for people (as they are, not as they should be in some ideal world) to get results. It is also useful in personal life: if you have no standards you can enjoy the company of people very different from you.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I learned storytelling mostly from reading fiction and comics. An economist  called David Lane explained me why that is important in a university seminar, long after I had finished my degrees. High school contributed somewhat to me picking up this skill, especially as I studied history. In retrospect, if I had had a good art teacher I could have learned a thing or two about storytelling by Renaissance painting, but no luck there.</li>\n\n<li>I learned divination from economics. For some reason a phrase by Albert Hirschman (taken from his introduction to his main book) stuck in my mind: he participated in the rolling out of the Marshall plan, and that experience \"developed in him a healthy respect of the market's ability to outsmart you\". This humble statement by somebody involved in the most successful economic planning exercise of all times struck me at a very deep level. Later, complexity science gave me a framework for that.</li>\n\n<li>I learned forgiveness from an older coworker in my first job, who later became my best friend.</li>\n\n</ul>I don't see why these things could not be taught in schools. In my time (and in my place, the Italian province) the approach to knowledge was old fashioned: you were taught notions rather than skills. But that must have changed.

I agree that the Khan Academy (although my experience with it is very limited to <a href=\"/t/test-driving-the-khan-academy-how-i-learned-to-use-conditional-probabilities-and-combination/1360\">the test drive I did of it for Edgeryders</a>) is probably not very good at telling you what it is important to study. It is a fair point, and I think you are the first one to bring it up in this discussion. Thanks!\n\nBut let's be fair here: schools are <em>also </em>famously bad at telling you what it is important to study. If your school system is modelled on Napoleonic France, you would have a centrally decided national curriculum, decided perhaps in the 1930s and tweaked around with a couple of times. Sorting the stuff that gets in from the stuff that stays out is an incredibly arbitrary, ideologically loaded and messy operation. So, for example, you get taught history from a very national point of view: students comparing history notes in Britain and France feel like they are living in alternate realities. In the 1980s, in school, I was taught Latin. Don't get me wrong, it's a great subject in itself: plus Latin\u00a0 was really the European connecting language in the Middle Ages, and if you did not speak and read it you'd be cut off from the action. But I have yet to see a convincing case for Latin to stay in the curriculum. If you want to teach me metalinguistic structure, why not Chinese? All in all, I'd take the random exploration over the national curriculum commission of fascist-era Italy any time.\n\nAnd yes, of course we all yearn for a wise <em>sensei </em>that will not just teach us stuff, but will make us better women and men, helping us to reach our full potential. But there are not many of those around: this education model seems fundamentally aristocratic to me. A development economist once said to me: \"there are too many teachers for them to be much better than the average.\" So, any viable education system has to assume normal people doing the teaching. They will typically care about their own well-being more than they care about yours, some will be passionate, some are just looking for any job, some will be smart and some will be stupid, or evil. Same as everywhere else.\n\n<em>Sensei </em>does not scale. You are a mathematician: well, Dr. Khan's videos are pretty much the best shot at access to an outstanding math teacher I have ever had - and that's after science high school and two degrees in economics. And I love math! Only, I discovered that when I was 20, because in school I was taught a caricature of it.\n\nOr does it? Do you have any idea of how <em>sensei </em>might be accessible to all?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 08:56:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.269518", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 508, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21704, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2864, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Coderdojo not involved that I know of</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/simonecortesi\">@simonecortesi</a>\u00a0is using CoderDojo as an example.

To me there are levels of trust, that can be drawn out by asking questions like \"would you trust this person to...\" You can sort these questions by asking a bunch of them together about the same person. \"... take a letter to the post office\"; \"... keep my house keys for emergency use\"; \"... look after my child when I'm away\" (and what age of child?) \"... not to trick me or take advantage\" -- all these (and many more) might have different sets of people who I would trust in that way.\n\nFor me, it's about having reasonable confidence that they would act in specific situations in a way similar to the way I would.

In your post, let us know:\n\n* What are you currently working on that is worth investing time and energy into?\n\n* What challenges do you come across and how do you try to solve them? Anything others here can learn from you?\n\n* How do you think a community like Spot the Future can be useful in Romania?

Almost at the same time, the more policy, advocacy and practice-oriented Community Informatics (CI) series of conferences began in Prato, Italy in 2002, along with an online email network and the Journal of Community Informatics. It is time to cross fertilize these discussions and to identify convergences, overlaps, divergences and common paths, as well as challenges for future research, advocacy, policy and practice.\n\nWe cordially invite submissions to the Seventh International Conference on Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T 2015), hosted from 27 to 30 June by the University of Limerick, Ireland. This biennial meeting serves as a forum for stimulating and disseminating research on the complex connections between communities - both physical and virtual - and information and communication technologies. This seventh edition of the conference will mark a stronger opening toward Community Informatics work.\n\nThe conference will be co-sponsored by the Journal of Community Informatics (<a href=\"http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej\" target=\"_blank\">http://ci-journal.net/index.p<wbr></wbr>hp/ciej</a>). The goal is to revitalize the academic discussion with a new format in order to make the academic discourse more relevant for practice. The organisers hope to widen the base of relevant case studies, and at the same time, strengthen the reflection regarding these practice-based cases.\n\nC&amp;T 2015 welcomes participation from researchers, designers, educators, industry, and students from the many disciplines and perspectives bearing on the interaction between community and technology, including architecture, arts, business, design, economics, education, engineering, ergonomics, information technology, geography, health, humanities, law, media and communication studies, and social sciences. The conference program will include competitively selected, peer-reviewed papers, as well as pre-conference workshops and tutorials, a doctoral consortium, and invited keynote speakers.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to an exciting conference in Limerick, a vibrant university city on the west coast of Ireland!\n\nGabriela Avram\n\nConference Chair\n\nOrganising Committee\n\nProgramme Chairs: Fiorella de Cindio and Volkmar Pipek\n\nWorkshop Chairs: Anne Light and Nemanja Memarovic\n\nTutorial Chairs: Doug Schuler and Sabine Moebs\n\nDoctoral Consortium Chairs: Susanne Boedker and Volker Wulf\n\nLocal Organisation Chair: Norah Power\n\nStudent Volunteers Chair: Laura Maye\n\nConference Themes\n\nC&amp;T focuses on the notion of communities as social entities comprised of people who share something in common; this common element may be geography, needs, interests, practices, organizations, or other bases for social connection. Communities are considered to be a basic unit of social experience. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can support community formation and development by facilitating communication and coordination among members, as well as enable and empower communities to deal with challenges and threats.\n\nTopics appropriate for submission to this conference are manifold. Examples of some of the vibrant areas of communities and technology research include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Communities, technologies and government (learning/education,\n\nhealth, cultural heritage, crises and natural disasters)\n\n\u2022 Civic Activism, Community Engagement, Participatory Publics\n\n\u2022 Communities and innovation\n\n\u2022 Crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, collective intelligence\n\n\u2022 Maker communities (makerspaces, Fablabs, crafters) and DIY\n\n\u2022 Online and offline communities\n\n\u2022 Urban and rural communities; urban technologies; urban informatics; urban interaction design\n\n\u2022 Smart communities in the context of smart cities\n\n\u2022 Sustainable communities\n\n\u2022 Communities, social media and social capital\n\n\u2022 Community-centred Design, Infrastructuring and Evaluation Methodologies\n\n\u2022 Ethnographic and case studies of communities\n\n\u2022 Communities, ICTs and Economic and Social Development.\n\nSubmission categories, Formats\n\nWe are calling for submission of full (research) papers, work-in-progress papers, tutorial and workshop proposals and applications to the doctoral consortium. Please submit all papers and abstracts in ACM SIGCHI two column layout (see <a href=\"http://www.sigchi.org/chipubform\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sigchi.org/chipubfo<wbr></wbr>rm</a>).\n\nPapers\n\nIn order to allow for a diversity of contributions, the conference will accept full papers and work-in-progress papers.\n\nFull papers must be no longer than ten pages, including all additional material such as references, appendices, and figures. Work-in-progress papers must be no longer than four pages. The papers must include a title, sufficient space for the author name(s) to appear on the paper, abstract, keywords, body, and references.\n\nPapers submitted by the due date will undergo a double blind peer review process by an international panel and will be evaluated on the basis of their significance, innovation, academic rigour, and clarity of writing. Accepted full papers will be included in the published conference proceedings if at least one author of any accepted submission has registered and attends the conference.\n\nAccepted work-in-progress papers will be published in the adjunct proceedings, and the same rule applies: at least one of the authors will have to register and attend the conference.\n\nPapers will be submitted via an online submission system that will open in December 2014.\n\nPlease send any questions to the Programme Chairs: PC_chairs@comtech.community .\n\nWorkshops\n\nWorkshops provide an opportunity to discuss and explore emerging areas of Communities &amp; Technologies research with a group of like-minded researchers and practitioners. They run for a half or one full day and will take place on June 27th or June 28th. Workshops offer the opportunity to advance specific research areas. C&amp;T workshops might address methodologies, emerging application areas, design innovations, organisational issues or education. Each workshop should generate ideas that give the C&amp;T community a new, organised way of thinking about the topic, or ideas that suggest promising directions for future research. Some workshops result in edited books or special issues of journals; you may consider including this goal in your workshop proposal.\n\nPlease send proposals to the Workshop Chairs: workshops@comtech.community\n\nTutorials\n\nThe purpose of the tutorials is to give the attendees the opportunity to acquire knowledge in new areas and add to their professional development. Topics can range from physical computing (Arduino, Raspberry Pi) to visualization, mapping applications, setting up a disaster coordination centre, and so on. We invite individuals or teams interested in presenting a tutorial to submit proposals. Tutorials will run for a half or one full day on June 27th.\n\nPlease send proposals to the Tutorials Chairs: tutorials@comtech.community\n\nWorkshop and tutorial proposals should be no longer than 4 pages and should include: the title of the workshop, the list of organizers and their backgrounds, and an abstract of no more than 150 words, as well as the workshop's theme, goals and activities, maximum number of participants, means of soliciting participation, and means of selecting participants.\n\nDoctoral Consortium\n\nThe Doctoral Consortium is scheduled prior to the main conference programme, on Sunday 28 June 2015. The Doctoral Consortium (DC) offers research students a special forum where they can present, discuss and progress their research plans with peers and established senior researchers.\n\nResearch students wishing to attend the doctoral consortium should submit up to 4 pages, using the ACM SIGCHI two column layout available at <a href=\"http://www.sigchi.org/chipubform\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sigchi.org/chipubfo<wbr></wbr>rm</a>, addressing the following: Introduction setting up your research area and specific research question(s)/goals(s) (including key related work); Overall research approach, methodology, and expected contributions; Work in progress (including findings to date and next steps); Questions and issues for discussion, and what you hope to gain from attending the DC; short bio.\n\nPlease send proposals to the Doctoral Consortium Chairs: dc@comtech.community\n\nStudent Volunteers\n\nC&amp;T actively encourages students to volunteer at the conference. Being a student volunteer is a great way to support the research community, meet other students in the field, and attend an international ACM conference. You will help the conference organisers with the running of the conference and support the setting-up of presentations and workshops. You will see the latest in C&amp;T research and development, and have fun while learning about running the conference. In return, you will get free registration. To apply, email us your contact details (email, phone, university), an abstract of your research project, a CV, and the reasons why you would like to be a student volunteer.\n\nPlease send applications to the Student Volunteers Chair: volunteers@comtech.community\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\u2022 1 Feb 2015 Papers, Workshop and Tutorials Proposals due\n\n\u2022 1 Mar 2015 Notification of acceptance (for Workshop &amp;Tutorial Proposals)\n\n\u2022 1 Apr 2015 Notification of acceptance (for Full Papers)\n\n\u2022 1 May 2015 Camera Ready Papers\n\n\u2022 1 May 2015 Workshop Papers, Work-in-Progress Papers, Doctoral Consortium Submissions and Student Volunteers Applications due\n\n\u2022 1 June 2015 \u2013 Early bird registration ends\n\n\u2022 27-28 Jun 2015 Workshops, Tutorials and Doctoral Consortium\n\n\u2022 29-30 Jun 2015 C&amp;T Conference\n\nMore Information\n\nFor updates, please check the conference website:\n\n<a href=\"http://comtech.community\" target=\"_blank\">http://comtech.community</a>\n\nDr.Gabriela Avram\n\nLecturer\n\nInteraction Design Centre, CS2031\n\nUniversity of Limerick\n\nIreland\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-01 22:38:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:22.268677", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1602, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7109, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5849, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Confirmed</b>\n\nThanks, will do!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-12 05:01:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.857282", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29745, "user_id": 252, "topic_id": 1951, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Hashtag</b>\n\nThanks a lot :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-18 16:22:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.744755", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29592], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10765, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1546, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>sure!</b>\n\nwell sounds good!\n\nplease write a post about it.

Why do we insist using our own platform?</span>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><span><strong>No intermediation</strong>. You are talking to UNDP in a space that UNDP designs and pays for. We believe we should not need to go through corporations to talk to our own institutions.</span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Fairness</strong>. On the Edgeryders platform, all your content remains yours. You just grant us the license to show it to others (<a href=\"/t/id/44\">legal information here</a>).</span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>No commercial interest</strong>. Mainstream social networks are for profit corporations selling contextualized advertisement. Facebook in particular constantly tweaks its code to show people content that their client pay for. They want you to look at what will make them the most money, not at what you are most interested in. We do not do that, so we can guarantee that your contribution will not be buried under status updates with energy drinks or fashion brands.</span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Access over time</strong>. Facebook, Twitter and the others never delete content; but they do make it difficult or expensive to get over time. You can't search for tweets older than 15 days; and Facebook prefers you to look at new content. Every contribution is precious to us, and we make sure it is fully accessible and indexed by search engines over time.</span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Privacy and data protection</strong>. Mainstream social networks use your activity to profile you as a consumer, and figure out what sort of advertising you are responding to the most. With our platform, you can choose to participate without your participation labeling you as a certain kind of individual in some massive database in the USA. Our servers are protected by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesdatenschutzgesetz\">German data protection law</a>, one of the safest in the world.</span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Inclusion</strong>. For all these reasons, there are people in the Edgeryders community that refuse to use Facebook and Twitter, many of them hackers. We value their point of view and do not wish to exclude them. </span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Reusability for analysis</strong>. We are not simply having a conversation here: we are collectively writing a document that encodes the views of citizens engaged in future building, social innovation, lifestyle hacking and so on. To aggregate individual opinions into a collective point of view we need analysis: to do analysis we need full access to the content. Mainstream social networks do not restrict access to our content, even if we created it. </span></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58819984485b4ec953fc5dfe67368f1fbb52361f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>", "created_at": "2014-04-03 10:08:34", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 10:16:14.869297", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 501, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 60.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [136, 1890], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20196, "user_id": 1679, "topic_id": 5191, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Suna minunat</b>\n\nMi-ar face mare placere.

Traffic recovers, but the trend resembles an economic \u201cstaglation\u201d curve. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>\u201cStagflation\u201d from April through August, 2014</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"204px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mGMeape9kAfAAJJv8FXo-uhmLzcDzjoSd1EjjoPkapLxi4N73HTdZbA4DBKdbFOHKSSr9PSDkpnGz2e_ETRKUjel6JMDeSQ4aIGS2wEM25C6vVaW3YZrVTeryBrKwoIVJQ\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"511px;\"></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Let\u2019s see how the this 3-month period of time looks like from a bird\u2019s eye view. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"251px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OML7ucSyiaWRN5mUMpQnbNx0KGcQBVuhpGuxYIMJwVaKB32ha5DCxMyhbSKeBIRQ0XVsZqEeNpaD6y4G_4H4c6aElgixwRpuGvedKjtSmMR-WC7pnEJrNIkPm7wuSTSJQ\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Over the last 3 years, since 2012, enthusiasm for Edgeryders can be basically identified and divided into three major \u201cpeaks\u201d, which seem to occur about once a year. My three month tenure manning social media accounts did coincide with our 2014 \u201cpeak\u201d although I cannot claim any credit for attracting the traffic. Common sense dictates that these patterns can be attributed to strength of various programs being run.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Generally speaking, I try to invest as much work into program design as possible, since I am aware that the success of the \u201cmessenger\u201d job function is almost entirely dependent on the program strength (assuming they know what they are doing). Unfortunately, when I began dabbling in the Futurespotters program itself (i.e. content structure), it led to lots of confusion and Nadia asking me to work on other things. I had no problems with this and continued the job of creating tweets or relaying pre-existing ones, occasionally also working with Facebook (however Dorotea Mar did more work there). </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>My assumption is that the web traffic going to Edgeryders.eu was not in anyway impeded by some kind of social media malpractice. You may consider that peak of traffic and the Futurespotters campaign itself to be a success. Perhaps it is, I am just not claiming to have had a substantive impact on it. I mostly just created, managed and organized messages which were relayed. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Tweet performance</span>\n\n<span>I used BufferApp for its convenience as a tweet scheduling tool, but another nice feature are the analytics it provides which shows how many people clicked on a given tweet. Here is an example:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"465px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T2aYV9uOZxfXi_QKzgir_gtR7eKE1pG96zu94l2IYAa47RvQOn2-DlaQzXN9-Y3mPoFBXhlku50Ue_U0IA8EVRwRMhDBlt5YFkya1WATU77uIOQYlg8qw5b8lB7yDsXXFQ\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Because there were so many tweets posted (and I don\u2019t have the premium version which would allow me to export into a spreadsheet), I will not include them all -- but most of the days looked like the screencap above. On average one tweet leads to just a handful of clicks at a time, oftentimes from a core edgeryders member. While the chart below does prove that Twitter is our fourth largest referral source after Facebook, direct traffic and organic search traffic, we also know that we posted lots of tweets (proven in the fact that each tweet doesn\u2019t generate many clicks, but overall Twitters still brings in many clicks). </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>We are conscientious about the possiblity that we are over-tweeting and potentially hurting the Edgeryders by posting too many tweets that just read like advertisements. The low number of retweets per tweet is proof that our messages aren\u2019t being socialized. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>With the exception of the Twitterstorm, it\u2019s safe to say that the way we use Twitter currently doesn\u2019t resemble what a successful outreach campaign would look like. As currently used, it might be more useful as a communications platform to keep members apprised of relevant information -- but I personally don\u2019t think there is some magic bullet solution (i.e. creative hashtag stuffing, and other optimization tricks) that some other social media strategist will try to sell you. I believe that any real changes you\u2019ll witness will continue to reflect on the overall strength of a program\u2019s ability to create a user experience or a desirable exchange of value between organization and audience members. This might be a sort of long way of stating that I am sad that we did not reach a 10% growth in traffic, month over month, which is the objective that I created in the social media proposal. But when I created the proposal I probably overestimated my capacity to add value at the inception stage of the Futurespotters program. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>My recommendation is that in the future, we shy away from hiring \u201csocial media\u201d practitioners and move towards investing in designers of organizational programming -- people who can create the winningest campaigns before a single tweet or Facebook status ever gets posted. Again, this is not to say that Futurespotters wasn\u2019t successful by certain measures-- but simply the outcomes you see today were already determined in the DNA of the program. The social media practitioner will only be able to express the DNA, so to speak.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Is there hope for social media tactics? </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The chart below proves that social media channels bring in traffic. Facebook is the number 3 referrer and Twitter, number 4. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><img alt=\"Capture.PNG\" height=\"366px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SF7Vr6iewtyYiOobEN2WNbiD6SuYzL1uInfn44AlzGHNzdnY7uOZhtlg6iIEzAa3ERmNLJewu7fcaAgglSU2q-qy8iaIad-eBUzrwnjBJSB3T1-2D1_3EVksOdCK83FfwA\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"719px;\"></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The real question, however, should be -- what is the quality of this traffic? What do these people do once they have reached our destination pages?</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The quick, depressing answer is that most traffic that landed starting April 15th, 2014, bounced off any Edgeryders.eu page within the first half minute:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"296px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dmSBEW2DoyMqRMGh81yi8mfEtVX2o3HWmxjRYu0Z3WrkwXVvAbUU4ORlgD1TPW-0HwqHINZyXIQDGUv38GSboPw4UqwZ8mF9MGghzhJEQRPFCZOnqXjqzEi7M_t6kgj42w\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"778px;\"></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>This is a very important statistic which cannot be ignored. Why are they leaving so quickly? Are we targeting the wrong people? \u00a0Or is the audience fine, but we are lacking something on the content and program side? Of the 16,000 or so visits that lasted more than 600 seconds, how many were from core members and employees who are bound to be clicking extremely frequently? Should we be turning away from mass communication strategies and working on more one-to-one networking relations? Unfortunately, I am not in a position to investigate these questions at the moment as they reach the very core of the organization. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>From experience, I will say that the social media performance will do much better once bounce metrics above change and start reflecting more genuine interest from general audiences we target. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Areas to explore further: Facebook + Pagemodo</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>As we all might remember, for less than $200 USD and a subscription to Pagemodo which allowed me to create campaign tabs, I was able to turn Edgeryders page likes on Facebook from the hundreds into the thousands, with the help Noemi and Vahagn who assisted with localizing content. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"300px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4GZJ-mlYDYgao6my9NHUIUgGt6JOrl3BWKxGLS5VtI2D03GkJXTRV4xFO9qHcnaw2ChtcFw-9DJcTX0Ae205X50K2rYd8GYwmcKQSIxpH17woS3fa2RWQzgAMFdE61YD0Q\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"878px;\"></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>I would like to caution against Facebook likes. Facebook\u2019s new monetization strategy is designed to keep these likers away from your content until you pay them over and over again. For this reason it is important to learn how to reach these likers through other means. This is where Pagemodo comes in. With Pagemodo you can create FB ads that brings in new traffic, and then you can get them to enter an email address through a form. Thanks to Noemi and Vahagn we were able to create no more than 10 solid contacts in Armenia. I am not sure what happened to them or if any great, transformative outcomes arose from these new people coming into the fold. Perhaps some of them were awarded travel stipends to meet Edgeryders in person at the conference. Either way I see an opportunity for us to refine the campaigns we create on Pagemodo tabs to increase the conversion rate on these form submissions which provide us with an email address. Facebook\u2019s excellent ad targeting technology means that we could continue to use it as a targeting tool in combination with Pagemodo. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Because I have a lot of experience doing this successfully, it is my recommendation that we try more campaigns of this type in the near future in a kind of setup where a couple of people work on perfecting the program and design and content, and I bring in the high quality traffic at a scale which is both exciting and cost effective. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-28 20:43:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.805407", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3437, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15768, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2893, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Neither did I.</b>\n\nUntil today - Sent out some emails this morning and started making people aware.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-30 16:49:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.577149", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11261, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4953, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I see it now</b>\n\nSo now I think I get it.. so Matteo you would like to try a process that starts before the event.

My home town has one of the few and the best preserved workhouse of the country. Recently there has been a bid the renovate and repurpose the space as a diaspora and geneological centre. I freely consult with the consultant on this project, a tipperary councillor named Brian Rafferty. I approached the team originally from the perspective that the heritage and true history of the situation would have to be honored if the project was to be a success and that in certain ways it must become the antidote to the perception of hardship that most people percieve it as being (and which, in all honesty, is an accurate perception of the elusive reality of that history).\n\nThe point that was important for me to make was that the workhouses were publically announced as the first form of organized social welfare in the country. That they served a community purpose and that in the remaking of this space there should be a strong element of that social aspect. I will not get nto the injustices in Irish history here, thats not my aim at all, and yet that is not to say that I am not fully aware of the situation as it was in reality.\n\nI suggested to the team a number of plausable possibilities. One was that, given the proximity of the workhouse to one of the poorest housing estates in the town, that there could be a Montessori school that operates according to the social enterprise of a specified successful Dublin company who are part of the SETF (Social Enterprise Task Force) in Ireland. I also suggested, having picked spuds for local organic farmers back in the day, and having heard how they interact with the bigwigs of Tescos and SuperValue, that a local Community supported market could operate in the courtyard; that the Irish should follow the Greek Potatoe Revolution. As chance would have it\n\nI read yesterday on my friend Lisa\u2019s facebook that she bought a bag of organic potatoes at my formeer employers organic shop for \u20ac2 less than the supervalue equivalent. My comment in reply was \u201cCommunity supported markets, local produce, undercut Tesco, nuff said!\u201d\n\nIn addition to this the idea has been raised to me that a forest would be good to balance the atmosphere in the surrounding area. Some 3000 bodies (probably more) are buried in the fields aling the rear and side of the building. A ceremony, a tree planting, and a forest made in the fields available to the rear is an event that can give a whole community, indeed a nation, a sense of meaning, and can serve an honorary and calming purpose and service to its site and situation.\n\nI have spoken with Slow Food Youth Ireland and to other members of the Cloughjordan Ecovillage (where Vinay lives quite a bit \u2013 hi Vinay) aswell as to members of a volunteer/selfemployment company called Local-Switch about their possible interaction with any potential project that could come of this also. Naturally, Edgeryders came up, and Brian was vaguely interested but\n\nI\u2019m not sure that he understands the potential of the situation. He agreed that the vision is there, but claimed that there was a lack of focus\u2026that I could not \u201cbe all things to all men\u201d.\n\nThe old generation of project manager are still in linear process and thinking hierarchically in too sharp a focus. Given your examples above concerning participation versus payed work I can see how the reallocation of resources in a distributed manner can fuel a distributed process whereby each of the participating entities can work together to achieve the best result. In the local setting you have to work with whats actually there. And so figuring that out is paramount (thats my answer to question 1 *ushaiddi/netention).\n\nOnce we know whats there we need some kind of intermediary, like an Unmonastery who can go in and actually apply the medium for that primary issue and bring the people concerned to the same table with some notion of a potential reality, or a series of potential realities for them to work toward. It appears that the beuraucrats cannot think like this, they need to, at the very least, see its potential and deregulate and/or reregulate as necessary.\n\nWhen you ask how far along this is already I would say that it is very far along, and that through digital loops such as Edgeryders and the various thinker and tinkerer networks emerging online there will soon be an emergent software to cater to the needs of these communities to map assets and resources in ways that will far accelerate certain modes of production, namely socio-cultural production within circular economies where products become services and work becomes life (again)\n\nGiven Alberto\u2019s concern I would like to offer that yes, there are two distinguishable interest groups emerging\u2026and yet it is in the interest of both to actually survive. Once thats assured, at least, there is still the concern of surviving without persisting in some crisis nightmare where even the highest amongst the \u2018have\u2019s\u2019 are worriedly watching. For the neccesary balance to occur the system has to be let find its own level, a level currently beyond the balancing power of the present socio-productive organization. Ideally, it can be recognized that different is not adverse, and that new is not to be feared, that just because its different doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t enjoy it or that you may not actually come to learn and grow of the experience. People forget the passion that got them to their \u2018comfort\u2019. We still need infrastructure, power, sustenance, education, culture, health services etc\u2026 Same-same\u2026 But different.\n\nYou ask what are the dangers? I won\u2019t direct my attention there. Whats the use when there\u2019s so much potential to work with in the space of life between? People get aggressive over contradictive ideology, but when it comes to social situations and the proof of the collective pudding the lesson that history teaches us is that, so far at least, things have been getting steadily better for people. If we can move with the times and with the \u2018decisive technology\u2019, then we can shed our preoccupation with the abstract personal and with the symbolic and move into a deeperly lived, and more fully conscious, Life.\n\nPersonally I believe that the route leads through culture and is a move, with the help of the head, to and through the heart and hands. I\u2019m working on a little something north of Berlin in May that will hopefully help me understand (and show a whole bunch of others at the same time) how different cultural groups can come together in a mutually supportive space to exchange values, and value, and crosspolinate to create a new space that is equally educational, packed with arts and culture, and productive of socially changent ripples. More about that later\u2026I think its a very good example of what you ask for in your third question.\n\nThanks for this Dougald, its a fine contribution. See you on the round.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-01-30 17:50:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.552539", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1259, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31542, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3630, "post_number": 17, "raw": "I have changed the provisional schedule, please ok it @Bjorn Ekblom\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-12 16:46:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.381280", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21642, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1533, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Help figure this out?</b>\n\nHey Jovin, how's it going my friend, still traveling?\n\nListen, I came across your \u00a0ideas about the future worker as I was reading a depiction of Edgeryders making a living and what better policies are needed, and you were quoted with the above.\n\nAnd along these lines, the report also says (p.8) :\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk7TdZzgO0L2lJ41FW9LMtWEI-_ybpB0PM594rbYVxU/edit\"><em>Contemporary internet based technologies provided prerequisites for acquiring a broad spectrum of knowledge, more or less profound, but still very diverse. In such a context specialisation of knowledge and skills is very often judged as limitations set by people who do not want to \u201ctry harder\u201d. However, the Edgeryder Charanya recognises that specialisation is not necessarily bad, introducing a new term for people who are both specialised in one area and posses knowledge of related fields:</em></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk7TdZzgO0L2lJ41FW9LMtWEI-_ybpB0PM594rbYVxU/edit\"><strong><em>\u201cSpecialization is good</em></strong>\u00a0<em>\u2013 Corporations find specialized employees stable and less risky. Majority of projects that require cross or multidisciplinarity are outsourced to consultancies. T-shaped employees or hybrids are therefore, not preferred within large corporations and the arena of consulting is extremely competitive \u2013 this was identified as one of the major problems in finding paid work as more and more individuals are or consider themselves hybrids. Hybrids are people who have expertise in one area and a general understanding of related fields giving them the ability to be inter- or trans-disciplinary. Society favours classical titles and hybrids fit none making it difficult for them to find a place in the traditional job market. Once again, the individual is an asset or resource in the context of existing institutions.\u201d (Charanya)</em></a>\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo be honest I don't know whether or not specialization is more marketable than diversity of skills..

It was not an easy task, and he managed to create a meaningful paper. So... first of all, I want to thank him for his good job.\n\nI have a little comment regarding something he mentions about Kyopol. In the paper he writes:\n\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &lt;&lt; They call what they do <strong>\u201cfrom-the-middle-and-out\u201d</strong>. &gt;&gt;</em>\n\nThere is a little confusion here, and I think he mixed two things that were discussed in this mission:\n\nhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/creation-kyopol-system-aka-symbiotic-city-internet-catalyst-civic-engag\n\nFirst, the term \"<strong>from-the-middle-and-</strong>around\", used here:\n\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0 &lt;&lt;Actually, at Ckyosei we advocate to mix three different conceptions for civic engagement: top-down, bottom-up, and one we invented (partly, as a joke), called: \"from-the-middle-and-around\". :-) </em>\n\n<em>Both the \"top-down\" and the \"bottom-up\" perspectives are too simple conceptualizations... that are not able to comprehend the nuances of such a complex phenomenom as civic engagement.</em>\n\n<em>...</em>\n\n<em>So... we think that we need to move further from the dualism expressed in the \"top-down\"/\"bottom-up\" opposition, and go in the direction of a \"kaleidoscopic governance\", with multiple actors and stakeholders involved.&gt;&gt;</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nShort afterward, after Anthony (Demsoc) commented: \"I think this is completely and I love the concept of <strong>'middle-out' </strong>\", I spoke about <strong>\"inside-out vs. outside-in\"</strong> participation:\n\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0 &lt;&lt; I think the notion of \"top-down\" vs. \"bottom-up\" could be complemented with the notions of \"inside out\" vs. \"outside in\", which somehow suggest the intrinsic logic that characterize a participatory process or initiative. The first case: \"inside-out\" would refer to the usual PR (Public Relationships) Participatory exercises, where those who have power, the ones \"inside\", are \"going out\" for a while to interact a little with the rest, hear a bit, say a lot, pretend to care, get legitimation, influence... but then come back in, where the logic of power and decision making hasn't changed. And then... the decissions are taken, in most cases, the ones that were already planned.</em>\n\n<em>\"Outside-in\" refers to the case where you make the frontiers \"porous\", to allow those outside to get access to the political structures. We are thus speaking of real processes of \"political development\" -understood as \u201can interactive, public decision-making and learning process, within and between government and civil society, based on power creation and dispersion\u201d [1], a process that usually only happens when an important share of the elites realises that it is in their own interest to progressively incorporate into decision-making some previously excluded groups, as a way to create the new forms of \u2018shared power\u2019 deemed necessary to cope with societal challenges. &gt;&gt;</em>\n\nAs you see... this was a rich, catalytic conversation, that made us 'invent' new concepts and terms. :-) Maybe Magnus would like to review/rephrase the problematic sentence. :-)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd... those were my \"two cents\"!

When it comes to the fairness issues in the sharing / collaborative economies, \"the trouble isn't money\". Or markets, as basic ideas. However, the trouble is facilitated by aspects of how our money and market systems are designed. Let me elaborate by deconstructing our notion of money and how and why the different aspects are used or not used in Makerfox:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Unit of account.</strong> A universal unit of value, for time, skills etc.. Very useful for reducing the transaction costs in trade. And for that reason, we use this monetary function in Makerfox. It allows us to find and execute\u00a0barter deals automatically. No other \"true barter\" platform (i.e. those without account keeping) does this, and I have yet to find out why :) See for example <a href=\"http://www.barterquest.com/\">BarterQuest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.netcycler.com/\">NetCycler</a>, <a href=\"http://openbarter.org\">openBarter</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Market price.</strong> Units of account can be used both subjectively (what is it worth to you) and objectively (what is it worth to the market). Market prices can be unethical, for example monopolist pricing. However, subjective pricing has its own problems (it allows gaming the system to profit from \"naive\" traders who bid high and sell own items for low prices). For that reason, we do not use it in Makerfox (yet).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Intrinsic value.</strong> Money as a medium of exchange obtains its value from being scarce. That is the same for gold-backed and fiat money, just that gold scarcity is more credible and less flexible usually.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Medium of exchange.</strong> Money is a resource that everybody wants, it is universally useful, the universal commodity currency. \"Reified pure value\", if you want. In Makerfox, we see this as the most problematic aspect of money. At first, it is very useful, as it enables trade cycles progressing step by step rather than at once as it has to happen in Makerfox. However, as money is always scarce, it also makes it flow to where the best use value per price is provided, that is, to \"big business\". In societies with oversupply capabilities, this naturally leads to underemployment and unemployment, and to the concentration of resources at \"big business\" actors. That can be counteracted by fair compensation and taxation as Robin points out, so money is not itself the problem. But our current design of money facilitates these fairness issues. Which is the reason why we don't use the medium of exchange monetary function in Makerfox and instead use bartering. In bartering, price is not the only decision criterion for a purchase. Rather, price and reciprocity. A barter deal only happens when everyone both earns and spends. In theory, this can fix economic exclusion / unemployment: in a highly efficient mass production society, unemployed craftspeople can still barter among themselves, even though they can't compete with the market prices of industrial production.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Store of value.</strong> Causes problems with inflation, deflation. Leads to the desire for lending money for interest, and thus easily to the concept of debt. Also induces collective trust problems, that either limit the size of the economy to a few hundred people (as in LETS currencies), or requires a trustable or powerful currency governor like a state or the exceptional coop (my only example: WIR currency). Not used in Makerfox to avoid the trust problems.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Debt.</strong> I would argue that the ethical issues of money do not come from simply using a quantified price, but by enabling market convertibility of certain items. Like kidneys: if a kidney exchange algorithm uses a numeraire to express recipient preferences (\"bid pricing\"), but kidneys can only be bartered against (donor) kidneys, there is no ethical issue.\n\nThere is a similar case with debt: debt is a credit relationship that can be transferred to a different creditor without needing the consent of the debitor. That makes debt problematic and destructive, because it abstracts away from the original social, trust etc. relationship. Having the numeraire itself is not the problem. For this reason, there are credits in Makerfox (the value transfer function uses them), but they are always P2P credit, not debt, and also without any interest.\n\nA third major case that I see is charging for knowledge reproduction: it lowers total welfare if we do. Knowledge reproduction has zero marginal cost (on the Internet at least), so if we can fund for knowledge creation in a stewardship model, the total welfare is larger. That's why on Makerfox, one cannot sell IP, but one can crowdfund open source / open content projects.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt became a bit lengthy. But I liked to sort my thoughts on the topic, haven't summarized it like this ever before.

After Thomas More's hero Raphael Hithloday I just had a dream of a new Utopia map and, click, click, it's (nearly) done ! Created by another Mo(o)re I cannot thank and encourage enough for his wonderful initiative - and Lyne for being a gentle muse to both of us.\n\nDo you know what? Tomorrow is my birthday and I think this dream Map - I didn't open the pack yet...- is the best gift you could do to me to boost me up, really ! Starting tomorrow I will therefore begin to fill up your map, as you ask it John, with my own related informations. And think over the best way to promote it inside and outside Edgeryders, following Lyne's personal briefing !\n\nLet's hope this common starting construction will be useful for a lot of people everywhere. With my grateful thanks for everyone's participation.\n\nYesterday, thanks to a close friend of mine, my eyes came on two quotations I would like to share with all of you, despite the fact that those short texts are in French (Lyne, please, would you translate better than me?).\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The one is from famous Swiss geo-politologue and UNO sting activist Jean Ziegler, and is <strong>about Utopy</strong>, one of my favorite creative themes.\n\n\"L'utopie est le d\u00e9sir du tout autre. Elle d\u00e9signe ce qui nous manque dans notre courte vie sur terre. Elle embrasse la justice exigible. Elle exprime la libert\u00e9, la solidarit\u00e9, le bonheur partag\u00e9 dont la conscience humaine anticipe l'av\u00e8nement et les contours. Ce manque, ce d\u00e9sir, cette utopie constituent la source la plus intime de toute action humaine en faveur de la justice sociale plan\u00e9taire. Sans cette justice, aucun bonheur n'est possible pour aucun d'entre nous.\" (Jean Ziegler, <em>L'empire de la honte</em>)</li>\n\n<li>The second is far more ancient philosophy, but still working nowadays. Special thanks to the Roman imperator and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius (Marc Aur\u00e8le in French), who let us know his <strong>three powerful rules of life</strong>, translated by the late Pr Pierre Hadot for Philosophie Magazine:\n\n\"Voir la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 telle qu'elle est, aimer les hommes et se mettre au service de la communaut\u00e9 humaine, accepter son destin.\" (Marcus Annius Verus, 121-180).</li>\n\n</ul>From utopy to human reality, these lines are a good introduction to the work of the cartographers of our changing world, aren't they, my friends?\n\n...See you on the Map !

This misconception basically maintain that all hierarchies involve a ranking or dominating judgment that oppresses other values and the individuals who hold them (hierarchies are a \"hegemonic domination that marginalizes differential values\"). But this conception of hierarchy comes from a pathological scheme of hierarchy, one that easily becomes a despotism. We must concentrate on the positive notion of hierarchy as the organizing principle of wholeness and learn how to implement the right schemes of hierarchies that are preventing despotism (domination). The following is a summary from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber\">Ken Wilber</a> 's book \u201cSex, Ecology, Spirituality\":\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><em>Holons, normal hierarchies and holarchies</em></u>\n\nAs used in modern psychology, evolutionary theory, and systems theory, a hierarchy is simply a <strong>ranking of orders of events according to their holistic capacity</strong>. In any developmental sequence, what is whole at one stage becomes a part of a larger whole at the next stage. A letter is part of a whole word, which is part of a whole sentence, which is part of a whole paragraph, and so on.\n\nArthur Koestler coined the term<strong> holon</strong> to refer to that which, being a whole in one context, is simultaneously a part in another. With reference to the phrase \"the bark of a dog,\" for example, the word \"bark\" is a whole with reference to its individual letters, but a part with reference to the phrase itself. And the whole (or the context) can determine the meaning and function of a part \u2013 the meaning of bark is different in the phrases \"the bark of a dog\" and \"the bark of a tree.\" The whole, in other words, is more than the sum of its parts, and that whole can influence and determine, in many cases, the function of its parts (and that whole itself is, of course, simultaneously a part of some other whole; I will return to this in a moment). Normal hierarchy, then, is simply an <strong>order of increasing holons</strong>, representing an increase in wholeness and integrative capacity \u2013 atoms to molecules to cells, for example. And these orders could be seen as ranked because each successive order is more inclusive and more encompassing and in that sense \"higher\".\n\nIt is for all these reasons that Koestler, after noting that all hierarchies are composed of holons, or increasing orders of wholeness, pointed out that the correct word for \"hierarchy\" is actually<strong> holarchy</strong>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><em>Wholeness and connectedness</em></u>\n\nTo be a part of a larger whole means that the whole supplies a principle (or some sort of glue) not found in the isolated parts alone, and this principle allows the parts to join, to link together, to have something in common, to be connected, in ways that they simply could not be on their own. And hierarchy is the basic organizing principle of wholeness. You cannot have wholeness without hierarchy because unless you organize the parts into a larger whole whose glue is a principle higher or deeper than the parts possess alone \u2013 unless you do that, then you have heaps, not wholes. You have strands, but never a web. Even if the whole is a mutual interaction of parts, the wholeness cannot be on the same level as the partness or it would itself be merely another part, not a whole capable of embracing and integrating each and every part. Hierarchy, then, converts heaps into wholes, disjointed fragments into networks of mutual interaction. When it is said that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,\" the \"greater\" means \"hierarchy.\" It doesn't mean fascist domination; it means a higher (or deeper) commonality that joins isolated strands into an actual web, that joins molecules into a cell, or cells into an organism.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><em>Asymmetry in hierarchies</em></u>\n\nHierarchy is <strong>asymmetrical</strong> because the process of increasing wholeness does not occur in the reverse. Acorns grow into oaks, but not vice versa. There are first letters, then words, then sentences, then paragraphs, but not vice versa. Atoms join into molecules, but not vice versa. And that \"not vice versa\" constitutes an unavoidable hierarchy or ranking or asymmetrical order of increasing wholeness. All developmental and evolutionary sequences that we are aware of proceed by hierarchization, or by orders of increasing holism \u2013 molecules to cells to organs to organ systems to organisms to societies of organisms, for example. In cognitive development, we find awareness expanding from simple images, which represent only one thing or event, to symbols and concepts which represent whole groups or classes of things and events, to rules which organize and integrate numerous classes and groups into entire networks. In moral development we find a reasoning that moves from the isolated subject to a group or tribe of related subjects, to an entire network of groups beyond any isolated element. And so on. This growth in wholeness occurs in stages, and stages, of course, are ranked in both a logical and chronological order. The more holistic patterns appear later in development because they have to await the emergence of the parts that they will then integrate or unify, just as whole sentences emerge only after whole words.\n\nIn any developmental or growth sequence, as a more encompassing stage or holon emerges, it includes the capacities and patterns and functions of the previous stage (i.e., of the previous holons), and then adds its own unique (and more encompassing) capacities. In that sense, and that sense only, can the new and more encompassing holon be said to be \"higher\" or \"deeper.\" Organisms include cells, which include molecules, which include atoms (but not vice versa). Thus, whatever the important value of the previous stage, the new stage has that enfolded in its own makeup, plus something extra (more integrative capacity, for example), and that \"something extra\" means \"extra value\" relative to the previous (and less encompassing) stage. And this extra value always means more holistic, or capable of a wider response.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><em>Hierarchy, control and heterarchy</em></u>\n\nSome hierarchies do involve a type of control network. As Roger Sperry points out, the lower levels (which means, less holistic levels) can influence the upper (or more holistic) levels, through what he calls \"upward causation.\" But just as important, he reminds us, the higher levels can exert a powerful influence or control on the lower levels \u2013 so-called \"downward causation.\" For example, when you decide to move your arm, all the atoms and molecules and cells in your arm move with it \u2013 an instance of downward causation.\n\nNow, within a given level of any hierarchical pattern, the elements of that level operate by <strong>heterarchy</strong>. That is, no one element seems to be especially more important or more dominant, and each contributes more or less equally to the health of the whole level. But a higher-order whole, of which this lower-order whole is a part, can exert an overriding influence on each of its components. Again, when you decide to move your arm, your mind \u2013 a higher-order holistic organization \u2013 exerts influence over all the cells in your arm, which are lower-order wholes, but not vice versa: a cell in your arm cannot decide to move the whole arm \u2013 the tail does not wag the dog.\n\nAnd here is completed a brief description of the hierarchy in its proper sense, positively, as a holarchy that allows the sequential or stagelike unfolding of larger networks of increasing wholeness, with the larger or wider wholes being able to exert influence over the lower-order wholes, i.e. to grow in levels of higher complexity that that allow behaviors and functions that are not possible in the previous level of growing. A holarchy where within each level, heterarchy; between each level, hierarchy; and where both both are complementary and essential to each other for a healthy system.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><em>Pathological hierarchies and heterarchies</em></u>\n\nIn a hierarchy a higher-order whole is able to exert influence over the lower-order wholes. And as natural, desirable, and unavoidable as that is, it is possible to see how holarchies can go pathological. If the higher levels can exert influence over the lower levels, they can also overdominate or even repress and alienate the lower levels. And that leads to a host of pathological difficulties, in both the individual and society at large. So, in a pathological hierarchy, one holon assumes agentic dominance to the detriment of all. This holon doesn't assume it is both a whole and a part, it assumes it is the whole, period.\n\nIt is precisely because the world is arranged holarchically, precisely because it contains fields within fields within fields, that things can go so profoundly wrong, that a disruption or pathology in one field can reverberate throughout an entire system. And the cure for this pathology, in all systems, is essentially the same: rooting out the pathological holons so that the holarchy itself can return to harmony. The cure does not consist in getting rid of holarchy per se, since, even if that were possible, it would simply result in a uniform, one-dimensional flatland of no value distinctions at all. Rather, the cure of any diseased system consists in rooting out any holons that have usurped their position in the overall system by abusing their power of upward or downward causation. This is exactly the cure we see at work in psychoanalysis (shadow holons refuse integration), critical social theory (ideological holons distort open communication), democratic revolutions (monarchical or fascist holons oppress the body politic), medical science interventions (cancerous holons invade a benign system), radical feminist critiques (patriarchal holons dominate the public sphere), and so on. It is not getting rid of holarchy per se, but arresting (and integrating) the arrogant holons. Thus, a normal hierarchy, or the <strong>holism between levels</strong>, goes pathological when there is a breakdown between levels and a particular holon assumes a repressive, oppressive, arrogant role of dominance over other holons (whether in individual or social development).\n\nBut not only are there pathological or dominator hierarchies, there are pathological or dominator heterarchies. In a normal heterarchy, which is<strong> holism within any level</strong>, goes pathological when there is a blurring or fusion of that level with its environment: a particular holon doesn't stand out too much, it blends in too much; it doesn't arrogate itself above others, it loses itself in others \u2013 and all distinctions, of value or identity, are lost (the individual holon finds its value and identity only through others). In pathological heterarchy, individual holons lose their distinctive value and identity in a communal fusion and meltdown. This holon doesn't assume it is both a whole and a part, it assumes it is a part, period. Thus, pathological heterarchy means not union but fusion; not integration but indissociation; not relating but dissolving. All values become equalized and homogenized in a flatland devoid of individual values or identities; nothing can be said to be deeper or higher or better in any meaningful sense; all values vanish into a herd mentality of the bland leading the bland.\n\nWhereas pathological hierarchy is a type of ontological fascism (with the one dominating the many), pathological heterarchy is a type of ontological totalitarianism (with the many dominating the one).\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, as we saw, hierarchies are not bad and in fact is the only way we are able to organize things and ourselves to achieve complex behaviors and functions. The problem resides in the proper balance between hierarchies and heterarchies, and the proper design of the schemes of hierarchies that avoid dominant holons.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 17:56:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.243997", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2142, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28429, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5187, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Ok rounding off - confirm if I you agree?</b>\n\n<strong>Selection of projects/people:</strong> Everyone is welcome to participate with their own projects, but we will be focusing video production/writing support on people working on projects or problems related to <a href=\"/en/opencare/welcome-to-opencare\">OpenCare.</a>\n\n<strong>Artefacts:</strong>\u00a0 for each selected project we will support participants to produce :1 high resolution photo + 1 written story + 1 Short Video.\n\n<strong>Roles and responsibilities:</strong>\n\n<strong>1) <a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\">@Thomas_Goorden</a>: Responsible for recruitment of Belgian participants, driving the workshop and delivery of videos.</strong> Suggested process: The one you posted above, ensuring there is sufficient time slotted for the hands on production of video and accommodation of Natalia's requirements for ability to delivery written pieces.

I think I had been anxious for a month about how the concept of unMonastery would be received in its future home, I anticipated struggle, objections - primarily a loss in translation, not between languages but culturally. unMonastery is born of <a href=\"http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kelly/\"><span>hacker culture</span></a><span>, a can do collaborative attitude demonstrated in the natural way </span><a href=\"/\"><span>EdgeRyders</span></a><span> has now come to self organise.

I\u2019m still unsure as to whether this was down to an investment in the idea of unMonastery or rather that unMonastery enables an axis or lenses by which localised problems can be filtered and discussed in an honest constructive manner. It seems to me in reflection that unMonastery functions as an idea or conceptual territory that can catalyse and allow for the collective discussion of what everyone is already thinking - and attempting to work towards.</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aadbed586c4bbfd4ca241b37611b5262a5e06346.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\"><br>\n\n<span>The structure of the day was as follows; </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><strong>10:30 (or 11:00 Italian time)</strong> - After a short introduction from the Mayor of Matera and </span>Rossella<span> from the organising committee for Matera2019 - Gaia presented in Italian a short </span><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/unMonastery/presentation-17863955?utm_source=ss&amp;utm_medium=upload&amp;utm_campaign=quick-view\"><span>presentation</span></a><span> I\u2019d prepared on how the unMonastery has progressed thus far, how we communicate, who\u2019s involved, future projections for the project and what we hoped to gain from the day ahead. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"356\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/17863955\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"427\"></iframe>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<b><span>12:00 - First Task: Social Asset Mapping,</span></b><span> in order to gain a rapid overview of Matera we asked those present to plot locations on maps of the places that they considered important, this was done on an individual basis followed by group discussion of the locations mapped. </span>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f85a24115498485186a6bf6bbd73ecec6df3d011.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\"><br>\n\n<span>Then we broke for lunch.</span><span> By the end of lunch and thanks to the incredibly fast work of </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piersoft\"><span>Piersoft Paolicelli</span></a><span> we had everything plotted from the first session available online to share with unMonasterians, EdgeRyders and Matera itself.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<a href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?ll=40.673087,16.598625&amp;spn=0.092178,0.213032&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=207595146999890559764.0004d893ac371ab3461cd\">Social Asset Map</a><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?t=h&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=207595146999890559764.0004d893ac371ab3461cd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.673087,16.598625&amp;spn=0.091136,0.171661&amp;z=12&amp;output=embed\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n<small>Visualizza <a href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?t=h&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=207595146999890559764.0004d893ac371ab3461cd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.673087,16.598625&amp;spn=0.091136,0.171661&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed\">unMonastery asset mapping</a> in una mappa di dimensioni maggiori</small>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<strong><span>14:00 - Second Task: Challenge Mapping.</span></strong><span> Taking the same format as the first task, individuals listed a broad spectrum of challenges and reformed into groups to discuss each point raised.

It\u2019s important in this moment that we begin to correlate and communicate the needs of local community with the sorts of proposals we elicit.\n\nPerhaps most importantly though this session demonstrated a need for a 4th component to the unMonastery structure, currently we divide the work of the project between <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/summarising-unmonastery-meetup-2-work-lore-and-the-future\">Internal, Interface and Outreach</a> - this session highlighted the need for a fourth pillar, upon the <a href=\"/t/exceptionally-fruitful-meeting-in-matera-get-there-by-all-means/1032/5\">suggestion of Bembo</a>; Injection: the ability for the residents of Matera to inject and enact projects within the context of unMonastery.\n\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of translating everything that came out of the day long session but between now and then, you can read the notes and some of the outcomes here: <a href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?ll=40.673087,16.598625&amp;spn=0.092178,0.213032&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=207595146999890559764.0004d893ac371ab3461cd\">Social Asset Map</a> / <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljtBqz6xJJd_AAU2itti8K8Hr0gnpAwadAmB_UbFVuw/edit?usp=sharing\">Challenges</a> / \u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yek26y1pXb9SPqPH-HxLziQyUKLIfVJqJ42y-p80WqY/edit?usp=sharing\">Proposals (Synthesis)</a>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><b>Stop. Breath.</b> </span>\n\n<hr>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>It\u2019s important to state that this post has a significant and obvious lack for the textural qualities of Matera, the people we met and the stories we were told - but like \\#LOTE this was an intense highly condensed three days in a place like no other, there\u2019s a lot that needs to be communicated. If you\u2019ve read </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities\"><span>Italo Calvino\u2019s Invisible Cities </span></a><span>you might be able to come close to imagining what Matera is like. I\u2019m still attempting to mentally download everything I thought, was exposed to and felt whilst in Matera but it will come in the next week, this is only the first of a series of blogposts that aim to share the experience and information gleaned from a short stay in the future home of unMonastery.</span>\n\nMany things happened during our visit, we met many amazing people and were fortunate enough through the generosity of locals to begin to see the place as it is seen by its citizens, what has become clear is the reality of unMonastery, the history it builds on, the weight of what is becoming possible and the shape of the work ahead. This is part of the gift given to us by the people of Matera, one that will require honest and real commitment to reciprocate.\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.15612334688194096\">The only call to action in this moment is to make a pledge, we\u2019ll be closing the EdgeRyders internal pre-call at the end of April but we\u2019d really like for you to <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/index.php/join-us/edgeryders-pledge/\">join us</a>.</b>\n\n<hr>\n\n<span>With these things said I\u2019d like to thank everyone who made \\#unMon possible. The people of Matera taking the time to listen to us and for their commitment and contributions throughout our stay. The committee of Matera2019 as our hosts, communicators and guides. Alberto Cottica for making this possible. Ilaria for showing us the things that we cannot see from the outside. EdgeRyders for their online support throughout the weekend. The unMonasterians, Gaia for her amazing ability to simultaneously think and share in two languages and generally hold everything together. Bembo for ensuring we never lose focus in taking ourselves too seriously and providing the kind of energy unMonastery \u00a0will require in order to come into being. </span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-29 17:37:48", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:38:40.899702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1967, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 40.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31984, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2766, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>great :)</b>\n\nsee you in the calls ! :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-29 21:22:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.841897", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31878], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29597, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2117, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>One person you should meet</b>\n\n[aden] and [Sam Muirhead], you should talk to Emanuela Vita about this (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/emanuela.vita.79\">Facebook profile</a>).

Thanks for your feedbacks. :D\n\nIn 2014, we started with the positive expiratory pressure therapy for CF children. It was in fact not the best move as the exercice takes about 30 minutes daily, which would require a lot of resources to have interesting games, plus the fact that the exercice is quite strict, so challenging to make it interesting. We then thought about other, more free gameplays, which we have to develop. We are now working on mini-games for asthma, that are about triggers and how to take the medicine. We want to reuse the work done for CF to build short games for aerosoltherapy.\n\nRegarding tests, we did a prestudy with ten children in a hospital, to see their interest, and that was positive. We are preparing two studies with focus groups to test the games that have been improved.\n\nMany learnings were also about setting the collaboratife framework, platform, etc. We are writing a few articles about that, that should be released in the next month. The initiative mostly advances during events as our community is always small, but we start to have funding and are going to redistribute them, with the aim to mobilize contributors on the long run. One big challenge is also that our non-exclusive model is not easily understood by authorities, so it takes a lot of time to explain it, and many fundings are not available as most competitions support profit-driven organizations. So we are thinking about creating a specific structure to be able to access these resources. Another thing is to move from proprietary to free softwares, for example from Google docs to a wiki, or from Unity game engine to another one. So they are lots of interesing challenges at different levels. :)\n\nWe invite you to subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2bK-LCBKF3SeFATwgg3U6g\">YouTube</a>, where we are going to release 15 interviews of what participants learned during the last gamejam. In the next months, we intend to do gamejams in Montreal, Geneva, and possibly Paris and Lima if you d'like to join there or remotely!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-10 13:04:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.889882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27622, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 4980, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>yes...</b>\n\n...I am just unsure how would we interprete the possible analyses, being unable to access the hidden confounders acting on them...\n\n...should we maybe think of a bootstrapping pipeline, testing several (realistic?) weightings/architectures of confounders, to get a distribution of trustworthiness of the models (and their interpretations)?\n\nJust running one analysis on the data doesn't seem to me any better than just formulating an informed prejudice... maybe different, but not better.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-27 12:17:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.483257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 82, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27621], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22400, "user_id": 1612, "topic_id": 2117, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Post UnMonestery Event </b>\n\nHey Ilaria\u00a0\n\nI totally agree about keeping up the momentum.

There was a farm that got abandoned and we got notice of it. It was a former biological farm and there was still a lot of material in it, like tools and also seeds. The people who were there before, rented the place and it was a sort of social farm that worked with people that are excluded. But they moved elsewhere and they left a lot of things. So we squatted the place and collected all the seeds in May 2010 and we started to build things, such as an outside kitchen that we call the people\u2019s kitchen and a system to collect rain water.\n\n<strong>What is your project about ?</strong>\n\nAt the beginning we started with a collective garden and then we proposed to neighbours and people from the city to start and take care of some small individual gardens. Because there is a lot of land and actually there is a very long waiting list to access the city gardens \u2013 so we organised an open garden day. Some people started to come on a regular base. We share the material and the compost with the people who are coming. There is no cost but they can give some donation to buy material or for what is needed in the moment.\n\nWe also have social meals. Except during the winter, every Sunday there is a meal in what we called the people\u2019s kitchen. We prepare it with the vegetables from the garden, with things we get from a local food collective and sometimes with food from dumpsterdiving. The meals are mostly vegan.\n\nAn other thing is that we made some juice together, because there were apple threes and other threes. We made more than 500 litres of juice. This is in the people\u2019s kitchen, it is in free access for people that come or when they are working in the garden and there is a free donation for it.\n\nIn general, we function in an horizontal way. We meet in a regular base to discuss and we take decisions together. Also, we try to work as less as possible with money, we use it only for material, to pay electricity and we receive some free donations. But for the rest, we try always to find things, go to containers, ask people. There's so much you can do with things that otherwise would get thrown away. Maybe I can add too that there is also a little freeshop \u2013 a place where people can put clothes they don't use anymore and where others can pick 'new' ones.\n\n<strong>And what about the house ?</strong>\n\nWe try to find people that were interested in gardening and wanted to sleep in the house. At the beginning we hosted people that did not have a home. The first ones were not so interested in gardening, so we asked them if it was okay when they found other places to stay that people more interested in gardening or more interested in the collective life came. This is what happened. Actually, the house works separately from the garden. They have a separate meeting with specific rules for the house and there is meetings and specific rules for the garden.\n\n<strong>What problems do you face in the day-to-day ?</strong>\n\nWe have the issues of living together, sharing a kitchen, such as washing the dishes and sharing garden materials and so on. This at the end is addressed by talking and having some rules. A good communication is also very important if you organise something like this with no budget at all. Especially when you invite people who are not familiar with people's kitchens and the do-it-yourself mentality that goes with it. So the issue is also to make sure that when things get broke, it is not always the same people that are fixing things or that clean up.\n\n<strong>And concerning the fact that you are occupying the place\u2026</strong>\n\nAt the beginning, we stayed there the first nights because we did not know how the owner was going to react. At the end, he reacted in a very positive way and has come to see what we do. Actually, he knew that the city was going to buy his land. The city had the plan to make there some football fields. After a while, we set at the table with the owner and the city that eventually bought the land but they were not interested in what was going on with the garden. It is weird because everything depends upon one person that is not interested in what we propose and does not recognise the social work we do \u2013 he simply refuses to talk with 'thiefs' of property. We still have problems with the city and are always in risk to be evicted. But more people is getting to know about the project and we have more support.\n\n<strong>Who else is coming to your garden ?</strong>\n\nActually, there is a growing network. People get to know about the project. We organise \u201cskill sharing\u201d, where people come together to show what they can do and share they knowledge. It is like how to fabricate some materials, like rocket stoves, or for example how to make cheese. Workshops are always linked to ecological issues. We also want to teach others about what we have done in the garden. For example, we built a dry toilet in one workshop. It is also something free and there has been a lot of people for them.\n\nSome events have also taken place. Most of the people that have come to do things have something to do with ecological movements but some are also more link to social and solidarity issues. There has been small festivals that have taken place, such as a project for Bolivia and another one for Mexico. We did not organise these events, we just host them. The idea is not to have the space for parties but more for this kind of projects. It's important for us to give a positive image so that people don't get scared and that it remains an open space that shows that another way of living is possible.\n\nFor more info on this project, you can click here: <a href=\"http://tlandhuis.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://tlandhuis.wordpress.com</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 09:24:59", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 06:22:45.099231", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1161, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29904, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3873, "post_number": 15, "raw": "@lilian, what a wonderful resource this is!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-22 11:16:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.582120", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29439], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3955, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3922, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Edgeryders.eu: social contract</h2>\n\nThe Edgeryders community, its guests (including other organisations such as commercial clients or funders ), using Edgeryders.eu accede to the following minimum social contract.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>Basic assumptions</strong></h3>\n\nThe mission of Edgeryders is to facilitate and encourage people to collaborate on and across different social-good projects in a free, self-governed manner. And to collect, codify and disseminate knowledge and skills that will foster collaboration on a massive scale, p2p.\n\nWe do not forget about political, cultural and other differences. However, at the time of working together we put all animosities aside, or at least we try to. Respect for trustworthy colleague, reliable coworker, we consider more important, than our dislike for his views, habits, or prejudices.\n\nWe are working out relationships within our team (understood broadly \u2013 with the guests) in the spirit of consensus-driven, cooperative community. Only when we achieve this, we can teach it to others.\n\n<strong>Relations with the stewards of the platform</strong>\n\nThe directors of Edgeryders LBG, the organisation that undersigns and is legally responsible for the Edgeryders online community platform. While Edgeryders LBG cannot possibly share all the views of Edgeryders community members, its' directors are members of the community and shares many of the goals of their peers. Edgeryders LBG appreciates the validity of community members' goals and work. It also finances technical maintenance of the platform and strives to create paid work opportunities for community members when possible. We appreciate it and show respect and courtesy in return.\n\nEdgeryders is based mostly on voluntary cooperation. Therefore, we are sensitive to anything that might jeopardize good relations with the community at large.\n\n<strong>Relations with the permanent directors of Edgeryders LBG</strong>\n\nDirectors of Edgeryders LBG are totally committed to Edgeryders activity. At the same time \u2013 after members enter and leave the platform \u2013 they will face the consequences (both good and bad) of our words, actions and omissions. We are aware of it and try to leave a good impression. In all situations of conflict or doubt, we turn to the directors of Edgeryders LBG for help or mediation.\n\n  \n\n<strong>Working for the Edgeryders</strong> <strong>Community</strong>\n\nEach member of the community and every guest of Edgeryders.eu is expected to spend a little time working effectively for the benefit of their fellow community members.

Because the different stakeholders involved will have different objectives, priorities, working rhythms, access to resources, ways of recognising impact and results. Designing the social contracts collaboratively helps surface underlying expectations and assumptions that may be obvious to you, but not necessarily to the people with whom you want to collaborate and the other way around. So we put together a blueprint for discussion and modifcation. This first attempt is based on lessons learned from Edgeryders 1.0 and other online engagement intensive projects and came out of many discussions on and off the platform over the past year.

I get an estimate of how much work/ time it could take and break it down into small steps.\n\n- I take a good look at your profile and try to get an idea of what you are interested in. If there is an obvious connection, I think twice about what you are likely to get excited about in my ask. If I'm not sure how to approach you I get in touch with community@edgeryders.eu and ask them for help to facilitate the connection.\n\n- I show gratitude and write a personal thank you note and recommendation. I support your personal development by taking the time to give you constructive feedback about your performance, and taking on board the feedback you give me. I show appreciation by endorsing your skills and sharing a meet the Edgeyder post about you and what you are doing/ interested in right now as well as what I have learned from you.\n\n- If I am asking you to help me just out of generosity, this does not mean I am indebted to you.

You understand that community members are not in your line of command. This ensures that they have nothing to lose in standing for truth. The knowledge work is transparently generated in a context which facilitates multidisciplinary, inter-generational collaboration between a diverse group of individuals on a global scale. You can choose your level of active engagement in the work of generating it. However we do require you to have at least one contact person from your organisation engaged in the online conversation. Ideally this person has to have a mandate to network and knowledge-weave between people working in your organisation and members of the Edgeryders community. You get high quality knowledge-work on wicked or fuzzy problems, that comes with legitimacy &amp; has been vetted by hundreds of eyes. You get human resources for social transformation in a context which makes effective use of online engagement to facilitate multidisciplinary, inter-generational collaboration between a diverse group of individuals on a global scale. We guarantee delivery (assuming you the client fulfill your obligations towards us). We will not charge you for the knowledge-work outside of specific deliverables, but we do expect you to pay a corporate membership fee to help keep the community going and developing further.

Within six months Vake Park became a permanent camp for creative gatherings, gardening workshops for school children and artistic performances, among many others. The construction has eventually been declared illegal and any further progress stopped.\n\nNow the core activists are starting a court case against city hall for allowing the company to build there.

A</b>\n\nAlberto,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Very true. A person who has that broad an historical view is rare indeed. I myself do not claim an encyclopedic knowledge of the past 10,000 years of human history. My formal academic training is as a Medievalist, so the period between the fall of Rome and, say, the reign of Elizabeth I is the period of time that I can comfortably talk shop about off the top of my head at a moment's notice. For any other period in time, I'll usually need to do a bit of digging first.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Nonetheless, any formal training in History gives one the general tools that can be applied to any period (how to look for sources/information, where to look, and what to look for). If I need to go really deep into a particular era, then this process can take time. But if I'm just searching for something quite surface level, then a couple of days worth of hard digging can often familiarise myself enough with a period or culture that I can comfortably discuss the generals around a meeting table. That kind of time usually only results in generalisations, however generalisations are frequently important as well, even if only to highlight places that merit further investigation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Here's a recent example. Earlier this week I attended a meeting to look at the Kony situation, assessing the most effective possible courses of action to either neutralise him, protect the people from his actions, or both. I got the invitation for the meeting just the week before, so I had less than a week to familiarise myself with the material so I could follow along and contribute something useful.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 I am by no means a specialist in African History. What I did have, however, were a series of themes that I knew would be relevant: warlords, displaced populations, political instability in Africa, and finally Uganda. Having tracked down as many articles, etc. about Kony and the LRA that I could find, I then started digging around the abovementioned themes to see if there were any potential correlations. If there were, those were the areas that I dug further into. Come the meeting, I was sufficiently comfortable to at least raise some of the points I had come to during my research, and was at least able to contribute here and there to the general discussion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of times my participation in these meetings looks a lot like this:\n\n<strong>Me:</strong> There appears to be some common points between what you're discussing and X from (mumble mumble) years ago. Have you thought of looking into that further to see if there's anything that can be learned?\n\n<strong>Expert: </strong>True, but Y or Z are factors that don't make those commonalities relevant in this case.\n\nor\n\n<strong>Expert: </strong>Huh, that's an interesting point. Look into that further for us, will you?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 While I would love to one day posess an encyclopedic knowlege of all history, I'm not quite there yet. So far, I pick things up as I go along and as and when it becomes necessary. Small steps, I guess. But I maintain that having at least a good nose for general trends that, with further research, can yield deeper insights, is still useful at this level of play, even if only to offer a slightly different way of looking at a problem.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 This is by no means me jumping down your throat. I'm glad for the opportunity to articulate stuff like this. It's just as useful to me to really think about how I do this stuff.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Keep reading, and show me no quarter. :-)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 15:22:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.360221", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 672, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5999, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5966, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello community\n\nhow about having a newsletter this week?\n\nI think i'd be nice to have a couple of updates about\n\n- LOTE6 preparations\n\n- what's new in OPENcare\n\n- what's new in the Culture Squad\n\n- maybe make a call for those who go to\u00a0https://www.ccc.de/en/ ?\n\nAnd anything you find interesting, relevant and worth spreading in the network.

More specifically I am a lover of democracy and the first goal of my life is today working for that in order to make people's life better. I am a \"participatory democracy developer\" ad my job now is to develop projects of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting\">participatory budgeting </a>in the cities.\n\nIt started long time ago. I finished the secondary school - degree in electronic and telecommunication! - and I was struggling to find a job. No way.\n\nSo it was usual to spent time watching tv, especially in night time...but no, not watching porno movies... worse: political talk shows! Even worse, the favourite one used to be <a href=\"http://www.portaaporta.rai.it/dl/portali/site/page/Page-0e5050a3-ea62-4bc5-9e4c-d5b26c958aca.html\">Porta a Porta</a>, a programme anchored by Bruno Vespa where the guests are usually politicians! I know, that is crazy, but the creaziest thing was that I found them damned interesting (perhaps - yeah! - that could be the reason of my aversion to politicians and to elitarian democracy).\n\nWell, to make a long story short, I enrolled at the University, faculty of Political Science, and from that moment on I've never stopped being interested on politics and, more recently, on democracy: BA, MA, PhD.\n\nI was studying in UK (Leeds University) when I discovered participatory budgeting, probably the most innovative form of democracy: basically, it is a way in which citizens can directly decide how to spend public money and elect special representative for that. That would have been my PhD thesis. And that was.\n\nAfter my filedwork in Porto Alegre in Brazil (where I had the good fortune to meet the founders and long time activists) I had the chance to implement without restraints a concrete experience of Participatory Budgeting in a small town called <a href=\"http://www.comune.canegrate.mi.it/\">Canegrate</a>. That meant that I could finally put into practice what I was trying to explain (with any results) during the academic conferences I used to participate. <a href=\"http://www.canegrate-partecipa.org/seo/\">Canegrate Partecipa</a> was launched and in three years it has been considered a best practice from many institutions: the Provincia di Milano awarded it as the most innovative <a href=\"http://www.provincia.milano.it/comunicazione/Premi/Comunicami/2010.html\">project of e-democracy</a>, it was selected as the best example of participatory project by the <a href=\"http://www.falacosagiusta.org/altramministrazione/storia/primavera-2011/\">Scuola di Alt(r)a Amministrazione</a>, and by the <a href=\"http://saperi.forumpa.it/story/61667/canegrate-partecipa-come-un-piccolo-comune-puo-costruire-il-bene-comune\">FORUM PA, the Forum of the Third Sector</a>. Actually it worked: during the last edition, almost two thousand of citizens (nearly 15% of the population) decided directly how to spend 100.000 euro for public needs.\n\nThe democratic mechanism is quite simple: citizens formulate proposals, public servants evaluate them and citizens vote the priorities, those who must be realized right now. They must be aware of simple rules: <em>the more they are, the more they get</em>. That is to say, they should make the effort to gather and come up with a joint or common project which is much more likely to find widespread support from the bottom up. In this sense, being aware of the economic restraints (the budget) is a valid incentive to realize that we are part a world of limited resources and nobody can pretend to get simply what they want. Today, citizens do not vote projects according to the knowledge of the common resources, they vote people according to somobody else's promises (which problably do not know how budgets neither)...\n\nThis large interests around Canegrate Partecipa, allows us to spread the idea as well as the practice in itself beyond the borders of Canegrate and the Province of Milano, as many other Municipalities were curios to know and experiment it.\n\nToday new and more sopisticated projects of participatory budgeting are carrying out in two Municipalities - <a href=\"http://www.cernusco-partecipa.it/seo/\">Cernusco Lombardone (LC)</a> e <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cascina-Partecipa/214445638644128\">Cascina (PI)</a> - and soon in an entire Province (Pesaro-Urbino). To be able to coordinate all them together and provide citizens as wella as local authorities for a useful and friendly tool, we are creating a web-based platform for participation and participatory budgetings.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What lies behind participatory budgeting?</strong>\n\nThere are several forms of democracies and democratic processes, but I believe we should first understand how human being, society and the world work. Afterwards, we can imagine and develop democracy.\n\nIn a nutshell, according to my opinion society is <em>relation</em>; agency depends on social structures as well as social structures depend on agency. People interact to each other and to \"the world out there\", si that intelligence and cohesion can spread only if information is shared and cooperation is promoted. Therefore, democracy is the poltical system which allows people to communicate, to be informed and to affect the sphere where they live. All these are the basic principles of the web. Therefore, democracy should broadly take the form of the web in the sense that people must be free to participate and self-organize in accordance with their natural forms of aggregation.\n\nPeople gather into specific themes, interests and projects and they do not really gather around political programmes. As a result, democracy should be based on participation over projects: people should be able to decide which and how develop project as well as to elect somebody who reflects their ideas. Those people will be responsible to find the synthesis, but the synthesis should be the interaction of such existing communities.\n\n(to be continued... )\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-28 23:19:15", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 07:43:12.528359", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1013, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 200.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4127, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4094, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This is an editable wiki, so feel free to add your own notes! If you don't have a lot of time, just skip the first 3 paragraphs :)</em>\n\nWith @Dorotea, @Hazem, <a href=\"/u/emkosz\">@emkosz</a>, <a href=\"/u/cataspanglish\">@Cataspanglish</a>, <a href=\"/u/marcop\">@marcop</a>\u00a0who are interested in the <a href=\"/t/now-hiring-two-community-minded-people-to-help-test-new-tools-for-collective-intelligence-on-edgeryders/4085\">Catalyst opportunity</a> we delved into what it would entail and particularly get a feel of how collaboration in Edgeryders (ER) works.\n\nWe started with clarifying questions people had, like Marco's. Having come across the unMonastery project in a workshop in Matera about the sharing economy, he wanted to know the connection between ER and unMonastery, and I walked him through it. In general we here are a bunch interested in the wild things that shape ambitious futures \u2013 from figuring out new ways to work, to building tech tools for more quality democratic participation, and to learning to grow our own food. It is very diverse, and makes for quite a smart group. By coming together our individual work becomes even more relevant, and we can find more easily resources to support it.\n\nNow about Catalyst collaboration: it\u2019s a small grant that the ER organisation got because there are these tools built in a EU funded project that need real people/communities to work with them. Both Edgesense and Assembl are applications that can be accessed online after some installation is done, and suited to visualize and respectively aggregate large scale discussions. Example: Edgesense is already installed, and it would be great if during this project the tester would examine in more detail the community evolution between July 2014 - Dec 2014, around \"stewardship\" conversations ahead and after our annual event <a href=\"/en/lote4/welcome-to-lote4\">Lote4:</a>\u00a0http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com/\n\nWhile Edgesense serves to decribe massive conversations (both visually and via network metrics), Assembl supposedly makes it easier to summarize content in various stages of the discussions, helping communities co-produce new ideas. We will find someone in the dev team to walk us through it (perhaps\u00a0@Alberto can suggest a name), yet it will require a little more time testing than Edgesense. \u00a0<span>Even so, both are estimated as part time work.</span>\n\n<strong>How do we recruit for this project and in general?</strong> ER is constantly building community to create our own pool of talent, learn from each other, and know where to find key skills in the community when paid opportunities arrive.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about educational credentials, rather about peer support and thinking well into the future\u2013 we work distributedly, coordinate online using the platform for documenting the work and keep others in the loop, while leaving it open for anyone to get involved.. \u00a0Some would argue we're on our way to become <a href=\"/t/this-is-your-land-edgeryders-as-an-engine-of-collective-intelligence/3364\">expert collaborators</a>, the best in the world.\n\nFor me, and some like Dorotea, it's important that <strong>if there is <a href=\"/t/now-hiring-two-community-minded-people-to-help-test-new-tools-for-collective-intelligence-on-edgeryders/4085/18\">room for collaboration </a>(which tends to always be), we'd take that in a second rather than have people compete against each other. </strong>Think job sharing, or alternatively make a small investment of time to follow a project/conversation and offer your input. This is what can spiral afterwards into new projects. On the other hand, a gig might work out better if someone takes clear responsibility to deliver.. so it's a judgement call.\n\n<strong>We decided to give it a couple more days for all of us to re-evaluate our preference,</strong> eg Marco applying was more like looking for a way to get involved with Edgeryders (I thought that was smart and sweet :))\u00a0Hazem mentioned a newfound preference for Assembl, even though he initially wanted Edgesense. Dorotea is willing to act as support to both. Ema, would be great to hear more from you!\n\nAny thoughts after our conversation? Perhaps some things are unclear? The others who couldn't make it to the call are most welcome too!

This is a situation with little hope for improvement in the coming years. Graduating in 2012 will undoubtedly be an exceptionally disheartening and grim experience for most young people.</span>\n\n<span>\u201cThe Lost Generation\u201d or \u201cThe graduate with no future\u201d have become commonplace terms for news reports and articles to characterise the gloomy prospects for those graduating today. However this projected future, presents at times a distorted and disempowering reality for young people and demonstrates in many ways a misrepresentation of the activities and work many are engaged and committed to. Whilst it is true that this generation is unlikely to be as economically prosperous as their parents generation, this isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of a lack of productivity and creativity but rather a lack of visibility for how recent graduates have continued to work during recession. \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The goal of this program is to address the fundamental issues of graduating into this new economic reality, by confronting the \u2018professional\u2019 context of the art world and its outer edges, the program will draw on the experiences of a group of individuals who have taken original and self initiated routes in developing a \u2018career\u2019. The primary aim will be to empower students to forge their own trajectory and to identify the core values in their personal skill set for establishing a sustainable form of living.</span>\n\n<span>Together we will work to define what a practice or career can be outside of University life. Facilitated through open discussion, original research and working towards a self governed social network for students to communicate and build bridges with recent graduates and society at large.</span>\n\n<span>In considering a shift from classic Fordist labour practices to a Post-Fordist economy, we will scrutinise the value of present skill sets developed in art school education for life beyond university. Art School education has come to offer a unique opportunity inside of contemporary institutions for self initiated work, creativity and research on the subjects that individuals define as important to them.</span>\n\n<span>With this in mind there will be a heavy focus on the nuts and bolts and practical application of a self sustaining practice and how to extend this skill set outside of education. Individual speakers will present their experience of forming collectives, constructing and financing live/work spaces and the day to day running of a portfolio based career. With a diverse set of speakers, from startup entrepreneurs through to independent curators and self financed artist collectives, the weekly series will present a comprehensive approach to navigating the new world of work.</span></b>\n\n<strong><span>Progress can be tracked here: </span></strong><a href=\"http://realitydevelopment.pbworks.com\">realitydevelopment.pbworks.com\u00a0</a>\n\n</h4>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-25 15:05:56", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 15:57:11.874202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1117, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29743, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 1767, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>hey</b>\n\nso sorry, Nadia. this week kind of blew up in my face. did you say someone might be available to work with me on this idea?

Of course, different people would be working towards different items in the plan, but it all comes together.\n\nAll the products of the publication plan should go in the Playbook. This is consistent with reviewers recommendation: push out our results more, connect more the efforts made by the different partners.\u00a0\n\nI propose:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>One paper on the OpenCare method (OpenEthnographer + GraphRyder). Working title: \"Detecting collective intelligence in a large-scale\u00a0online conversation with ethnography and network science\". Authors: @melancon , @Amelia , myself. Submit to <a href=\"http://www.internetscienceconference.eu/papers.html\">INSCI conference</a> under theme \"2. Digital Social Innovation Platforms\" (new deadline: May 26th) as a short paper (6-9 pages). Do not worry if it gets rejected, it still gives a deadline. I have a pretty good idea of how to structure it :-)\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>One paper on observing collaborative care\u00a0in action with online/onsite ethnography. This is the famous paper we have been talking about in Geneva. Authors: @Federico_Monaco , @Ezio_Manzini , @Amelia , @Noemi . More on this at the end of the post.</li>\n\n<li>One paper reinventing ethnography as a collaborative, data-driven discipline. This was known in the group as \"the speculative methodological paper\".

It wants verify the potentialities of collective intelligence and of a radical open approach to the topic of care.\u00a0\n\nCoherently with that, the definition of precise research questions (and related methodologies) has not been given a priori, but will emerge steps by step from the same research-related activities (as opposed to what happens with the standard research methodologies).\n\nGiven that (that, by the way, is what makes OpenCare so interesting for me), I think that the positive tension towards understanding \u00a0where we are and where we are gong should be continuous and should be monitored step by step. On the basis of this tension research questions should be progressively better defined considering: the general research question where we started form, the commitment with UE, the first \u00a0ideas that are \u00a0emerging and, last but not least, <em>a better understanding of who we are and what are the knowledge, skills and experiences we can use</em>.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Shared visions and languages</h3>\n\nOn the basis of the discussion I think, that, at least for who expressed themselves (see later, item 5), we agreed on these points:\u00a0\n\n1. The open care systems is an ecosystems: an environment where, in its best conditions, different care-related entities can emerge, live and thrive. These entities are very diverse in nature. They can be: care encounters, networks of care, enabling systems, different kinds of infrastructures, policies, norms, norms, ... ).\u00a0\n\nAn ecosystem cannot be designed but can be enriched introducing new caring entities (with the double goal of offering more opportunities for both the caregivers and the care receivers, and for incising its systemic resilince.\n\n2. The OpenCare croup and community specificity is that we deal with open care ecosystems having a particular experience and credibility on issue related to \"collective intelligence and radical open approach application\" (and not of care issues per se). \u00a0Given that we should orient our community's discussion on topics that coudl be defined like that: which problems and the opportunities arise when \"collective intelligence and radical open approach\" are applied to and issue as \"care\".\n\n3. Discussing about openness applied to care issues, we have two main dimensions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the openness in the processes thanks to which enabling systems (i.e the enabling products, services, places, infrastructures) are designed and realized</li>\n\n<li>the openness of care-related services in use (i.e. the openness of the network of care created around the delivery of a service).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nBoth these dimensions are important and could be considered separately. Nevertheless, it could also be very interesting to consider the interactions between the two.\u00a0\n\n4. Given what has been said in the point 2. and 3. an emerging research question could be: How and how much the openness of a design and production process influences the openness of service delivery. And vice versa.\u00a0\n\nHopefully, other research questions, similar in nature to this one, will emerge.\n\n5. In my view, the workshop participants who express themselves should agree with these 4 previous assumptions: can we ask them?\n\nThe problem is that, at least half of the participants did not \u00a0openly expressed themselves. And this seems to me a bad signal. What ca we do to stimualte their opinion?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-04 12:58:34", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:19:36.129736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 597, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 26.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10916, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3555, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Adding to the wiki</b>\n\n;-)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-05 14:15:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.976016", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7262], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16437, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5018, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>It's not just you or Italy</b>\n\nFrom the little that I've worked in the Romanian cultural sector or with veterans inside it, it's pretty clear that the grant funding model via the public sector is broken because it doesn't help grow companies, it helps to some extent survival through struggle. <a href=\"/u/raluca_iacob_pop\">@Raluca_Iacob_Pop</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/cosmin\">@Cosmin</a>\u00a0are two of the people who have a lot of lessons to share, and hearing those \\#fail stories is disheartening.

My answer to John --- <span><em><span>an</span> </em><span><em>intuition</em> --- </span></span>was to highlight Edgeryders participants, and have them emerge as leaders. Michel Fillippi's answer is to have the most numerous leaders emerge, and he explained why.\n\nHere is what Michel Fillippi told me, via the following Edgeryders status, <a href=\"statuses/552\" title=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/statuses/552\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/statuses/552</a>):\n\n(My translation) \u201cWe should seek for various possibilities, different leaderships. Why? The first reason behind (this method) is because it\u2019s systemic. Every leader is to create a world, a system (as defined in the General Systems Theory). A system grows and becomes more unstable. Any system involves a becoming. Several competing systems allow individuals to engage in various futures and this prevents a system to seek its maximum state, therefore, prevents it to reach a maximum instability. Individuals must be taught not to seek unique solutions, not to aim to a state of perfection. We should also know that all creation, any system design, generates violence because a state of energy is being released, or the convening of power to make it work. Nothing is done in calmness, quietness. Therefore, <strong>(efforts should focus on) having the most numerous leaders emerge</strong>, while preventing one leader in particular from becoming dominant. (When in a process) of structuring, (it is preferable) to avoid convergence and develop even opposed themes. I think \u2013 as I have faith in philosophy -, that the debate on \"Which people? Which kills, abilities, and so on?\" \"How the Real in which humans exist?\", \"What worlds are better?\" What does everybody hate?\" \"What is a civilization?\",\"What does 'being civilized' mean? \",\"For what, for whom, for what world are we willing to suffer, to die \", these are classics philosophical questions, but they are worth to be re-asked, and be explored again.\u201c\n\nMichel Fillippi continues:\n\n\u201cYesterday, I visited an exhibition about Buckminster Fuller. There, I read a sentence in which I recognized myself, and I also recognized in it one of these blockages that you mentioned, Lyne, regarding the model. As the model is not externalized, it is not yet perceived as (being in the process) of building, therefore, the (implementing of) change is difficult. We must come to understand that our opinions, beliefs, desires, and perhaps even wishes that we consider to be the most real - a truth that comes from the core of being, the substance of our bodies, our essence itself -, are only constructions that we have absorbed without criticism, without us knowing it could become otherwise.\n\nAs for convergence, is a problem in innovation design. A trend of engineers and administrators is to converge as quickly as possible. It is a cognitive model that has been \"swallowed\" as truth, and indisputable as a procedure based on algorithms, mathematical. However, (it is better) at all costs, to converge as late as possible. Specifically, a design method such as C-K designed at by The School of Mines of Paris (Hatchuel), fight against convergence by using the mathematical notion of \"forcing\".\n\nFinally, about the \u201cReal\u201d. I believe in the existence of a physical \u201cReal\u201d, that is not fully known by the physical sciences, with whom, as humans part of this \u201cReal\u201d, interact with.\u201d\n\n(Ref: \u201cReal\u201d. This is EXACTLY what I believe too! I am having a really hard time explaining this and applying it to politics and open government models.)\n\n<span><span>It has been</span> <span>a month since</span> Michel Fillippi, JohnFMoore and myself, </span><span><span>we would like to have</span> <span>a discussion about</span> <span>models.</span> Leadership models, and open government models. <span>We </span><span>set it aside</span> <span>to</span> <span>focus</span> <span>on the</span> <span>Edgeryders</span> <span>'</span><span>augmented</span> <span>ethnography</span> <span>approach'</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>Now that we're</span> <span>just a few days before the</span> <span>launch of the upcoming campaign</span> <span>'</span><span>We the</span> <span>people'</span><span>,</span> <span>I realize</span> <span>that these topics respond to our needs.

I've also been writing for Dec\u00e2t o Revist\u0103 quarterly since its very first issue, back in 2009, and I\u2019ve been the editor of one of its online series, <a href=\"http://www.decatorevista.ro/?s=bucuresteanul\">Bucure\u0219teanul</a>, for 2 years. The purpose of the series is to tell stories about the people who live in the big B.\n\nOne thing I\u2019d love to be able to do for a living is to write about change makers, about those who cannot sit still, about those who believe you're only really doomed when you give up trying. Once you begin to look around, you see them everywhere, so many people to meet, so many initiatives to keep up with. Unfortunately, making a living out of this still seems a remote possibility.\n\nYesterday, while walking aimlessly (my favorite way of discovering and falling for the city all over again), this time through Cotroceni, I found a I found a poster that lead me to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/incotroceni?fref=ts\">\u00cencotroceni </a>\u2013 a Facebook page dedicated to the people who live in the neighborhood and want to talk about it and get to know it better. I didn\u2019t know about this page, but then again, I realized, maybe we only need to know about them in order to see how much can be done on a small scale. Maybe what we need is more of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/initiativafavorit?fref=ts\">Ini\u021biativa Favorit</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PrieteniiParculuiIor?fref=ts\">Prietenii Parcului IOR</a>, people who share a neighborhood, brought together by a common good or mission. Maybe what we need is more of what CeRe does on the civic front, an amazing NGO that is helping citizens to form neighborhood organizations, find leaders am and intervene in the city administration process. Maybe each neighborhood should have its own revival, its finding itself and fighting to change itself. And this thought \u2013 because all aimless walks eventually lead me to familiar places \u2013 reminded me of two other things: 1. A scene from ONGFest, which took place last weekend \u2013 three kids working together around a small table to solve a puzzle map; the pieces were the city\u2019s neighborhoods. 2. There\u2019s not much to do in one\u2019s neighborhood. Almost all the significant cultural events happen close to the city center. People have more chances to accidentally meet those they share a street with at the supermarket than at a concert, a debate, an exhibition, a small festival. And all those events \u2013 the concert, the opening, the festival \u2013 are places where we usually make new acquaintances, find out about all sorts of things, build communication bridges.\n\nWhat I\u2019d love to do is bring groups like <a href=\"http://www.arcen.info/\">A.R.C.E.N.</a>, <a href=\"http://calup.ro/\">Calup</a>, <a href=\"http://oricum.ro/\">ORICUM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ce-re.ro/ENG/home\">CeRe</a> together, to see if and how cultural initiatives and civic participation ones could come together in order to help shape and strengthen communities all around the city. I\u2019d top it with contributions from superheroes like <a href=\"http://www.funkycitizens.org/\">Funky Citizens</a> and <a href=\"http://thesponge.eu/\">The Sponge</a>, to see how technology could help with that. Gazeta blocului? A zine or photo challenge (and exhibition) dedicated to the past and the present of a boulevard? More of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/femeipematasari\">Femei pe M\u0103t\u0103sari</a>, an event that closes a street for a weekend and turns it into a festival venue? More closed streets? More open houses, where people could meet and talk, about anything from cooking to reading? I'm still brainstorming this myself.\n\nPS: Welcome to Bucharest, Noemi.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-15 06:05:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.864889", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 709, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4451, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4418, "post_number": 1, "raw": "If someone wants to take a shot at modding this...\n\nfile_fid:13981 - remove txt to edit as svg", "created_at": "2015-05-18 20:06:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.950672", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6918, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5592, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Well done.</b>\n\nLooking into it today.

The housing evolved to semi open housing with public workshops, community driven workshops, personal workshops.\u00a0 63 People in the project. Equilibrium between people with no revenue (eg. Refugees), jobless people, people with normal revenues. Everybody needs to pay money to stay, but people without money pay \u20ac60 per month, people with basic income pay \u20ac90, people with normal income pay \u20ac120/month. There is a non-profit organization that talks to the owner of the building. This entity is administrated by the people who live there. There are different levels of involvement. However, everyone is involved in one way or another: legal, lobbying, administration, \u2026 Representatives are chosen among the inhabitants. Some revenue is generated through workshops.

We have a partnership with the Marine Institute to develop a workshop for children.\n\n\u00a0Are institutions aware of your work? or do you operate outside?\n\n\u00a0We are not structurally funded, but we are open.

Dans notre culture (tunisie, afrique in general) c\u2019est logique, mais le probleme c\u2019est le financement , mais apr\u00e8s on a vu que \u00e7a c\u2019est reveil\u00e9 dans la politique. Mais pour le moment c\u2019est que des projets porteur politiquement, mais au niveau de la pratique c\u2019est difficile, il faut une periode d\u2019amorsage\u00a0\n\nPour lotfi, ce n\u2019est pas seulement un truc de solitude, c\u2019est aussi un apprentisage de valeurs, de fenomene sociaux. Cotoyer les personnes ag\u00e9s, on de la socialisation, car les gens de different milieux vont apprendre l\u2019un d\u2019autre, le ph\u00e9nome d\u2019etre utile. Les gens ag\u00e9 en occident sont vieux et ag\u00e9, et plus utile, tu attend\u00a0\n\nKasim responses: the old people are sepperated from the rest of the adults, they don\u2019t have a conextion.\u00a0\n\nDid you already done projects: we have started some construction works. We don\u2019t talk about generational society, we don\u2019t valorise the old.

A mini society would be very nice.\u00a0\n\nWhen he is 18, it is finished, so you are all alone, what with autism problem?\n\nThe problem that society wants to see everybody cured fast.\u00a0\n\nSelvi reacts: would this be possible to bring to the intergenerational thing,.\u00a0\n\nKacim he is a syrian refugee, he was 4 years in the doctor studie, but couldn\u2019t do it here. In syria we have an islamic solidarity in society that creates a kind of health system without organization, like you have to give a part of your money to the poor, you have social care system that is organized by the people itself. If you haven\u2019t fastened for one day, you have to give food to 64 people. Every doctor works one day for free. That is how we can survive under a dictatorship.\u00a0 We are already prepared for any kind of chaos, it is made for any kind\u00a0\n\nI want to see the hole society as one body, here everybody lives in his box, boxpeople. You live together but you don\u2019t live together. You are online, but not connected, we have to discuss, to see each other more. This is my new society, so i want to care as much about this now.\u00a0\n\nIt is much more complicated within syria, because it are different armies. `\n\nQu\u2019on soit a damas, timbuktu ou bruxelles, on partage tous la terre.

It has an area of 1,47,181 sq.km. which is 0.3% of the total land of Asia and 0/03% of the world. Based upon its landforms and climate , Nepal is divided into three regions: the himalayan, the hilly and the terai region. The high himalayan mountains in the north, the moderate Mahabharat hills in the center and undulating chure hills with their sheltered lowland in the south are the pre-dominant landscape of the country.The himalayan region of the country occupies 15% of the total land area of the country, which is above 3300m from sea level. The surface of this region is steep, rocky and full of glaciers from snow-clad mountains such as Everest, Kanchanjunga, Makalu etc. The hilly region occupies 68% of the total landarea of Nepal. It altitudes from 600m to 3300m. I t is made up o Mahabharat range, valleys, foothills etc. Lastly Terai regions streches from the Chure in the north to theindian border in the south which occupies 17% of the total land area of the country.\n\nNepal is a small garden having various caste and ethnic groups. As stated by Late king Prithvi Narayan Shah \"Nepal is the garden with 36 varities of flowerand myself a gardener of it.\"It clearly shows the differences of the ethnic gropus and caste in it. There are various caste here. According to the ethnicity there are many language, cultural and social differences in the himalayan, hilly and terai region. All the people have thir own way of living. There are four religion in Nepal namely: Hinduissm, Budhhism, Islam and Christianity. Similarly, Nepal is one of the richest country in the natural resources. It has the world highest peak : Mt.Everest. Many others mountains are their in\u00a0 different part of the country. These snow-clad mountains also havemany rivers originating from i. Nepal has also got many thick forest and vegetation. Hydropower generetion is one of the major way to use the energy source in Nepal. Inspite of these natural facilities, Nepal isnot being able to make the projectof its own rather there are many political hindrance in it. It has also gothotspot destination for the tourists from round the world. Surveys show that its mountainous sides are uniquely preffered for trekking and mountaineering .Its natural and cultural diversity is very pecuiliar. Challenging mountains, \u00a0rivers, great variety of beautiful scenery,good varied climate, rich animal and plant life, interesting cultures are the possible reasons for tourism in Nepal.\n\nAccording to above diversity and probability of Nepal. There are so many means of natural resources which can be used for future use. we should unite ourselves politically, socially, and respect each other. There must be public participation in development work which will lead the country for sustainable development. Federalism is one of the better solution for the development and unity in the developing country like ours because of differencein the ethnicity and way of living. We should manage our natural resources like water, forests, land, and medicinal herbs. Poverty alleviation is one of the important tasks in Nepal. People living under the poverty like should be given the required materials for increasing their income. If the condition of poverty is similar as now then it is really a tedious challenge for Nepal to be developed.we should manage our religion and culture. Caste based occupation should be taken.If there is the prevalence of the caste based occupation then the tourism will also increase.Tourists gets attracted through the nepalese culture rather than the high accomodation.Oviously, Security plays a greater role gor the development and planning. Cleanliness should also be managed. Allthe cities and towns including the village should have organized sanitation facilities. The disposal of household waste should be managed properly.\n\nIn this way we can make ourselves organized for the future Nepal. Nepal is already beautiful gift of nature. We only need to add some spices in it. All the matural resources should be properly used. The resources should be utilized genlty. Hence, Government and citizen should rise up togrther for the oraganization of ourselves for new and future Nepal.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-19 17:50:25", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:50:14.295992", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 722, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 40.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25015, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1785, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>GO!</b>\n\nI love it.

The goal: curate a theme on citizen and open science at the <a href=\"/t/introducing-openvillage-festival/36\">OpenVillage Festival</a> on October 19-21. This series of blogs is an ongoing report.</em>\n\nJune has been an instructive and productive month. The OpenVillage program is becoming concrete, my own learning is accelerating and the projects I\u2019m involved in are going through a transition phase.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Shaping a\u00a0program</h3>\n\nThe OpenVillage program I had in mind when starting my curation task has completely changed and keeps doing so. Well, yes and no. The people and projects come and go, however the questions remain the same. We really are all in the same boat when it comes to the obstacles we face.\n\nOlivier from <a href=\"http://echopen.org/\">echOpen</a>\u00a0summed up their issues in a conversation we had. They nicely cover most obstacles:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>How to put everyone together productively without eg. 2 people having to work full time?</strong> Two aspects: community management and information sharing.</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Legal frameworks and patents</strong>. How to make things reusable for everyone regarding regulatory and patent framework?</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Reliability and safety</strong>. How can you ensure that the community with its contributions (the sum of all) are good quality and safe?</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Economic model</strong>. We have no capital, no investors, no shares. We use other channels like foundation money, but this is not sustainable. How do you sustain a project?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese have been the issues of many open.citizen science projects, including ones I am involved in. Even beyond citizen.open science this is true. On June 28th we had a community call to discuss common threads across the themes at the festival. Focus points will be funding and funding policies and coordination overhead.\n\nThere is however another issue that many of us don\u2019t think of immediately. It takes a more long term perspective: funding policy. The DIY Science Network seeks to address this, as separate projects most often don\u2019t have the time, network or expertise to invest. Through conversations with <a href=\"/u/lucy\">Lucy Patterson</a>, two questions emerged:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>How do we encourage funders to support DIY science initiatives now?</strong>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>And, longer term, how can we foster a funding culture that is supportive of non-institutional science?</strong>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe DIY Science Network will work on these questions over the summer, at the OpenVillage Festival and hopefully long after that.\n\nThese are just some of the sessions that have taken shape in the last weeks. At the moment, the sessions in the theme look like <a href=\"/t/theme-open-science-and-citizen-science-for-more-inclusive-healthcare/6359\">this</a>.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Learning</h3>\n\nMeanwhile, my learning path is gratifying. I\u2019m getting a better feel of the field by talking to a diverse set of people, getting out there at different events and synthesizing what I see and hear in posts like this. For my curation work, it has been important: I ask better questions. While buried in the daily tasks of keeping a project afloat, this would have been impossible.\n\nAnother rich learning aspect is my involvement in the Open Insulin project. I experience the dynamics, obstacles and opportunities in a complex citizen science project firsthand, much more explicit than in any project I have done before. The lessons have not fully formed yet, but my initial assumptions have certainly been challenged. I hope to clear this out in the next months and report on it.\n\nAnthony pointed out one of the aspects in a preparation call for his session at OpenVillage. No one in the team has the time to put into organising or documenting information. So with people dropping in and out (especially experts), knowledge gets lost easily. Counter Culture Labs has made efforts in finding a solution, such as involving an organisational expert, yet without lasting effects.\n\nWith global collaboration on Open Insulin taking off, this becomes a necessary improvement. Luckily for CCL, it does not cause much trouble within their team. It is a relatively minor obstacle they have at the moment.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Transition dynamics</h3>\n\nThe projects I am involved in (ReaGent, Ekoli &amp; Break it Down) are going through transition phases. This requires us to take a step back and deconstruct what we\u2019re doing. It comes at a good time when I\u2019m doing such in depth work with other, often similar projects for OpenVillage.\n\nWe break down many of the processes that we have, eg. logistics for running the lab space as a community, with the purpose of building new ones. This process unearths dynamics that would otherwise be harder to spot for the community, such as the difference between being an open lab and being a shared lab. And then what that means for being an open, shared lab.\n\nMid June we had a workshop with the ReaGent team to look closer at our strategy and implementation for the shared lab space. It was fruitful and is the first of several sessions this summer across our organisations to get everyone aligned. In our next location, the financial pressure from the rent will be higher. We need to prepare. Set up our business models and synergies between all organisations. Design the next iteration for resilience.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn July I\u2019m attending a <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/amsterdam-biohackathon-tickets-35167108769\">Biohackathon</a> in Waag in Amsterdam, where I\u2019ll meet many protagonists in citizen.open science &amp; DIYbio. Over the next weeks, we\u2019re also moving into logistic planning for the sessions at the festival and picking up communication efforts.\n\n<em>This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-30 15:45:52", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 14:16:33.158255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1153, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 221.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3622, 3, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10030, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1481, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Barack Obama, pr\u00e9sidentielles, opengov, Qu\u00e9bec et R\u00caVONS!</b>\n\nC'est certain, l'\u00e9quipe de Fran\u00e7ois Hollande s'est d\u00e9fonc\u00e9e pour faire cette campagne, et le fait d'avoir appliqu\u00e9 le mod\u00e8le am\u00e9ricain Obama en France d\u00e9montre l'impact grandissant des m\u00e9dias sociaux.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://photo.parismatch.com/media/photos2/actu/politique/bastille-hollande-nuit/4762121-1-fre-FR/Bastille-Hollande-Nuit.jpg\" style=\"width: 526px; height: 304px;\">\n\nJ'\u00e9tais absolument bouche b\u00e9e devant les images de la Bastille, le rassemblement monstre qui a eu lieu suite au d\u00e9voilement des r\u00e9sultats. NOIR DE MONDE!!! C'\u00e9tait des personnes rassembl\u00e9es dans le R\u00e9el, et non pas dans le virtuel, me direz-vous... mais j'ai eu l'impression, par ces images, qu'il y avait eu une mont\u00e9e certaine de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour cette \u00e9lection dans la population et que l'adr\u00e9naline coulait dans les veines de tous au cours de cette nuit. Ils disent qu'une image vaut mille mots...\n\nLes innovations mise en oeuvre au cours de la campagne \u00e9lectorale de Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, m'ont fait esp\u00e9rer que la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise s'int\u00e9ressera probablement bient\u00f4t aux principes du gouvernement ouvert. Beaucoup de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli par la France pour livrer un plan num\u00e9rique, pour cr\u00e9er une r\u00e9volution des donn\u00e9es ouvertes, etc. Mais il n'y a eu quasi aucune ouverture pour le gouvernement ouvert jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour, \u00e0 l'exeption d'un petit bastion, comme dans les histoires d'Ast\u00e9rix, ou pourrait d\u00e9crire cela ainsi... Le maire de Nantes, <span><span>Jean-Marc Ayrault,</span></span> a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul \u00e0 s'aventurer dans la d\u00e9mocratie participative. (Il \u00e9tait pressenti comme candidat au poste de premier ministre, sous S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, si ma m\u00e9moire est bonne).\n\nDans les faits, un seul \u00e9lu de la France s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au GouvCamp \u00e0 Paris, le 8 avril dernier. Pourtant, des \u00e9lus, il en pleut en grande quantit\u00e9, en France. Comparativement au Qu\u00e9bec, qui ne compte qu'envion 7 millions d'habitants, il y a beaucoup plus de membres de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale, de maires, et de repr\u00e9sentants r\u00e9gionaux. Un seul \u00e9lu, cela repr\u00e9sentait la d\u00e9confiture... pour les organisateurs de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement.\n\nCette \u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle co\u00efncide avec l'annonce, de la part du gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec, du lancement d'une initiative de gouvernement ouvert (survenue le 2 mai dernier).\n\nEn \u00e0 peine un mois, les bonnes nouvelles s'alignent les unes derri\u00e8re les autres. Cela est encourageant.\n\nRomain, sais-tu si Fran\u00e7ois Hollande s'est prononc\u00e9 sur le concept du gouvernement ouvert? Je n'ai rien vu passer \u00e0 ce sujet dans les nouvelles, mais je ne lis pas tout. Peut-\u00eatre que j'ai manqu\u00e9 des bouts... Vu l'absence flagrante de d\u00e9cideurs gouvernementaux au GouvCamp, j'imagine qu'il est encore trop t\u00f4t pour entendre parler de ces questions. J'entrevois cependant cela comme la suite logique de cette campagne pr\u00e9sidentielle.\n\nUne des premi\u00e8res choses qu'a faite Barack Obama, une fois devenu pr\u00e9sident des \u00c9tats-Unis, ce fut de signer le Memorandum on Transparency.\n\nCe serait une bonne chose d'avoir prochainement un Memorandum sur le gouvernement ouvert, de la part du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-09 16:50:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:57.956850", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 560, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15469, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4094, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Edgesense main developer </b>\n\n... is<a href=\"/u/luca_mearelli\"> @Luca_Mearelli</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-11 11:47:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.068565", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13926, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5546, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Hello !</b>\n\nHello girls, welcome on board :)\n\nCute picture\u00a0- judging from your background, I can't wait to see your contribution to the project !\n\nLuce\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-20 13:51:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.723545", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14862, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2330, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Bootstrapping, realistic expectations &amp; building sustainability</b>\n\nFrancesco hi,\n\nI have tried to respond to your points below where I feel I have some input\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<em><span>At LOTE3 I realised there was a lot of problems related to the project and during the days I was there, I think we spent time talking about us, our dreams about the project, our expectations but not enough about how to solve those problems to make unMonastery a good project.</span></em>\n\n<span>One of the key reasons as to why it is important to keep as much of the communication as possible in writing is to ensure important information, points easily missed etc are picked up and made visible on the platform. </span><span><strong>Did you raise these points in the unMonastery sessions and or include them/the ensuing discussion in the\u00a0documentation on the platform?</strong>\u00a0</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em><strong>Lack of a clear economic model</strong></em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\"><em>During my Italy tour before unMonastery, almost everyone I met asked me how this community-based project was going to run without money and I had no answer.

These could be co-authored in groups, and then made available to everyone, participants or interested outsiders to use and send to the correct sources.\n\nIt's also possible that we could have some non-written content made - videos, short podcasts. That would depend on having the correct personnel in the room, but we could definitely have the equipment available so that it's another choice.\n\nTo me, i'm starting to see the bare bones of a structure.\n\nThe workathon isn't scheduled yet, but we could do it before the 10th Feb.\n\nI'm still waiting to hear back from Tin Gerber to see if he's interested in helping me set it up.

For the \"<strong>re-collection parade</strong>\" I see it like in 2 phases: the first for plates, forks, pans, glasses ecc. (like every Saturday morning) the second for food (wouldn't be collecting bread and vegetables 1 month in advance. We would need a supermarket caddie and then parade around the city with musicians, artists and stuff. However, my opinion is that we give something in exchange: like a MOO Card (in Italian) which gives u access to something, or put an unMon sticker on the window which means that the people at LOTE will privilege spending there money in those cafes rather than those who didn't give anything (I'm thinking out loud). What's important here is that I would like to break the idea that since they are giving something, we owe them a favor. It's more like showing them that this is a real opportunity for them too... For example, I know the daughter of the guy that owns the supermarket chain in Italy (and MAtera): if I ask her stuff as Ilaria, she will give it to me, but then I will be caught up in this favor exchange thing which has been devaluating our projects, profesionnalism ecc. Other thing is going up to her and explaining the LOTE and telling her this is a great opportunity for you too but you have to figure out why, and if you do, well, it's free of charge but everybody's contributing with something so... here's the supermarket caddie! For this, what is needed?\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the locals: gimme the artists and the creative paradors: where are they? The ones I know will say they are to old for this :-)</li>\n\n<li>flyers &amp; stickers &amp; catchy stuff we can exchange with the objects given to us: We start in October, can the vectorials be ready by then? Anybody up for this? Rita, can the MT2019 Committee pay for the printing? It's not much... counting that this would make them gain money in buying plates and stuff.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n2. Ben made us some unmonastery emails in a glimpse: I wrote to <a href=\"http://www.sviluppobasilicata.it/index.php?lang=en\">Sviluppo Basilicata</a>\u00a0to ask for venue (the Incubatore in the Sassi) + explain the concept + ask to start doing the connection with local enterprises and help out with communication: in case they need an <strong>official protocol</strong> (they have one with mt2019 but it's not working that good) would Edgeryders social enterprise be interested in signing one or better not?\u00a0\n\n3. Was thinking it could be interesting to <strong>convey ressource people from Europe and Italy</strong>, such as Bart from <a href=\"http://waag.org/nl\">De Waag</a> (he confirmed he's coming to Nadia), to specific panels. For example, there's a slot on makerspaces and crafts? Well, I am sure <a href=\"http://www.univiu.org/people/340-stefano-micelli\">Stefano Micelli</a> would love to be there. Once certain slots are decided, and the communication material is done, we could build on Matera's networks to convey specific people to specific slots. This would enable participation in an intelligent way (hopefully): all the people from the ER coming, discussing, chatting, showing, exchanging... probably Materani will pop up but be to shy to participate. If we manage to convey them with their works and their project to a place where there are also some names which represent the interesting change that is going on in Italy, maybe there are some good chances to overcome the dillusion and the scepticism that still prevails in many people.\u00a0\n\n4. I'll finish with a story. <strong>Last night in Matera was hell</strong>. It had all started out greatly: a couple of phone calls, a vague appointment, one indiciation: bring whatever you want to make a dinner in the Via delle Beccherie. A friend brought the\u00a0<em>ciambotta</em>, another brought the bread, another tables, some others the chairs. In no time we were having dinner in the middle of the road, happily talking about many things, untill... the discussion fell on the unMonastery. For those who don't know, Nadia's <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/68839894\">video </a>in English, was followed by my amateur <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/71630857\">one </a>in Italian, which brought some friends of mine to produce hilarious <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83_hKLvorIg\">parody </a>which was viewed over 800 times in a couple of hours. This was great pubblicity. But then the discussion went totally rotten. Bottom line is the following, and it came from very enthousiastic people who participated in the first workshops of the unMonastery: these guys get a whole venue, and the local operators which have been trying for years to organize events and do stuff have never had any support actually they got only obstacles. Now I am entitled to know how much the locals can be negative and sceptical and \"permission-dependant\". However in this case I understood their point. For example, a guy said (speaking more in general about mt2019): instead of having us present ourselves to eachother 20 times why don't they start by going to the Municipality and ask the Culture Office for all the project proposals which have been deposoted in the 5 past years, and start from there in order to get to know who's who and who is allowed to do what? The question was: why should we come for the xxth time to stuff that comes from abroad and see how great these people are when they are put in conditions that we can't even dream about? And you're even asking us to make stuff for free for them? This \"us-them\" dynamic is something that has to be overcome, and the LOTE is there to do so. But, on my side, I know that building on personal relations and words is not sustainable any more - neither for the LOTE, neither for the unMon, neither for Matera itself. Stuff has to be done, there is no better engagement than action.\u00a0\n\nWith these words, my fellow friends, I leave you and wish you a good weekend... shine on!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-06 11:51:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:55.155596", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1102, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16005, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4963, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Robert Palmer, leading voice on cities and culture is coming!</b>\n\nGreat news today, <a href=\"https://fr.linkedin.com/in/robert-bob-palmer-1a963317\">Palmer (Bob)</a> accepted our invitation to come and share a little about his work over the years.

Very tricky business always, and far beyond my personal horizon [&lt;-- another one of those] for the most part. But very important I think.\n\nRe collapse: This is perhaps also one of them in some respects. I did not mean it in a \"zombie apocalypse\" way. More in a (slow) \"Fall of Rome\" way, where after 200 years you'd start wondering if you're sitting in Byzantium (which held up much longer) or Rome. Most of the time it is just relatively slow business, many long meetings that don't get shit done, and broken upper management. In terms of such \"toned down\" future spotting there are two useful sentences that often appear useful to me:\n\n\"The future is already here, it is just not distributed evenly.\" (i.e. you just rearrange existing stuff) and \"The future comes from behind.\" (i.e. you think you're heading in a certain direction (mostly based on narrative) and are typically blind to developments that come from somewhere else (often (willfully ignored) fact based). There is a related one which is: \"Walking backwards into the future.\" In my opinion it gives society too much agency in where it is going, through I like the image of being somewhat able to extrapolate future developments from looking at the past. I think that is a good point to start, but my perception is that most of the time what is called \"history\" is a horribly, horribly skewed, spotty, far too high level write-up of things for the majority of which we don't even have words yet (not to speak of better forms of communication), because we only seriously started talking about the past since yesterday or so. But I am rambling. :)\n\nIn short: Yup, I agree.\n\nA funny thought though: What does it mean if we want to push collaboration, but then see us talking about autonomy? I think it is not mutually exclusive, but it is interesting none the less, no?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-27 08:38:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.805441", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27389], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31265, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4525, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Randomized trial</b>\n\nI am out of my depth here. I do not really have much to say about building institutions\u00a0<em>in general</em>, though I have dome some highly specific institution design in the past. A small contribution: it would be incredibly forward thinking if alternative leaders were given freedom to operate on a few villages, so that different approaches to relief could be prototyped. Even better would be to mount a randomized trial assessment on it. Take 10 villages, with broadly similar characteristics and randomly assign 5 of them to structured NGO and the other 5 to alternative leaders (whatever that means). Then go back in two years and compare the two groups. I know, it's just a fantasy.\n\nIt is a long shot for many reasons, one of which is capacity. Grassroots communities are extremely smart and productive, but they tend to be small, and alternative leaders tend to be few and overwhelmed. Supposing government and other institutional actors threw the door wide open, how many alternative leaders would be ready to step in?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-18 21:53:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.980632", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 185, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2687], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15013, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 576, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Sure.

When we opened the shop we had some examples of \"free-shopping\" or swapping already at the evening of the non-official opening. The plan is to have volunteers who would be there at the swap shop a few times a week, for a few hours, so we can advertise the shop and people will gradually start coming and spreading the message.

I lived with eight other people in a bus. We travelled the United States for a while, then we settled down in Tennessee, and started a commune that still exists in the form of a cooperative. So we lived with the people we worked with; and at the beginning we did not really know each other. The bus context shaped our interaction: whatever we did, even a simple thing like having a meal, we simply would have to sit in a circle. It got very intense.\u00a0 Had to talk to the others directly about problems.\n\nWe were hippies, and this was wartime in the US with the Vietnam war. The police did not like us and did not want us around. We needed to be a real community, because the context pressed us into being one. And we did: we had problems, but we stayed with it.\u00a0\n\nAfter this tour, we did not want to go back to our old lives, so we bought 1000 acres of land (later another 700) in Tennessee, where land was cheap (70,000 USD). So we had land, we started with a load of buses parked up.\u00a0 We had a spring with some freshwater, but we had to build our whole infrastructure. If you wanted to take a shower, you needed to find a spring, cap it, install a pump, erect a tower, build a bathtub etc. It was challenging, but we did it. Eventually we had 6-700 people; you did not know everyone anymore. We founded an organisation called Plenty International, that did \"good\" locally and also internationally (disaster relief in Guatemala). For example, we squatted a building in New York City and founded a free ambulance service. Then we moved to Washington D.C. and founded the first bilingual free clinic. Even recently some of our people were involved in helping out in Louisiana after hurricane Katrina.\u00a0\n\nWhat that gave me is the idea that it is actually possible to build a collective. It's difficult, but you can build deep trust relationships with people who start out as total strangers to each other.\n\nWe made mistakes, we were too leader-oriented; we had too many rules that became a sort of dogma. When we were growing older, we fired our guru. We changed from being a collective to being a cooperative.\n\nThat was when John left.\n\nThe counterculture was a crucial element in the founding of the personal computer. So I moved back to California and started working at the WELL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL), the first real online community, pre-Internet, started by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant. The WELL sold computer network access to people mostly in the SF Bay area. And I realised that the power of relationships carried over to online relationships.\u00a0 Did everything I could to strengthen relationships. The WELL was not in the computer business, it was in the relationships business.\u00a0\n\nCommunity is one of these words that have forty meanings to it. User-centered social behaviour. Communities as bundles of relationships. Or even better, an ecology of relationships. Community is when the people declare it for themselves, not when someone else says they have something in common.\u00a0 What I have learned about is that it takes time: don't do it if you don't have the time to allocate to it.\u00a0\n\nCoping with meltdown:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tDecide that YOU won't meltdown ahead of time. \"Have a big fuse\", don't lose it, even when everybody else does. People would write to me and say \"I can't stand this, I can't take it.\" And I would reply \"It's all right, hang in there. Stay with it. It's worth it, you'll see.\"</li>\n\n<li>\t\tDesign the community's ground rules. Is there going to be moderation? Enforced by whom, how?\u00a0 hierarchy, consensus, consensus -1, do-ocracy.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tUse decent software -\u00a0better the tools fewer the rules.\u00a0 Think about saving time. \u00a0sharing links, able to ignore people is very useful, placeholders (get back to where you were), jump from private interaction to public. Simplicity makes things great. Think about how you go from public to private conversation and vice versa. In my opinion there is no service out there that is \"perfect\": some are too simple and inadequate, some are very powerful but difficult to figure out.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe nature of human attention- people get addicted to it.\u00a0 Some people say stuff just to get attention.\u00a0 Bigger community grows more less socialised people will want to join.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAttention makes things grow (less makes it shrink) last word syndrome.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tBeware \"last word syndrome\".

Booting people out can be very\u00a0 difficult / complicated.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes they come back and integrate\u00a0 sometimes for revenge.

We open governments... sounded almost corporate, almost like a service agency, apart from that edge of... agency... of intent.\n\nWikileaks. We all know the story now - Julian Assange, raised in a cult (maybe), cipherpunk programmer (likely), started wikileaks (probably), kicked out by his own team (depends who you ask), cut off from donated aid by VISA etc (perhaps illegally), then long house-arrest for allegations of sexual assault (no charges yet filed.) The fact that it's necessary to attach a \"credibility level\" to nearly any statement about Assange highlights one thing: he's succeeded in becoming almost as opaque as his enemies, hiding in plain sight, spinning a defensive cocoon of narratives, all mostly alike, slightly interlocking, a mosaic of partial truths and outright lies, dazzle camouflage of the destructive inventor of open source espionage, or one of our leading civil libertarians, depending on who you ask.\n\nSuch is the rabbit hole.\n\nLet's have a think about the Wikileaks original business model.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Governments are basically conspiracies, at least the bad parts of them.</li>\n\n<li>Leaks do far more damage to conspiracies than they do to open organizations.</li>\n\n<li>Making leaking things easier, safer and more reliable therefore punishes conspiracies more than good people.</li>\n\n<li>Wikileaks provides infrastructure for better leaking, resulting in a more open, better world.</li>\n\n</ol>It all sounds so easy on paper. The actual business of running an open source espionage service, however, seems to have broken reality pretty badly - hatred, allegation and counter-claims are knee deep, with the Establishment playing a dignified-if-vicious defensive game while waiting for Assange to alienate the remainder of his base. Even if they'd succeeded, a group of what-amount-to activists amassing a substantial pile of classified material with little control of how \"hot\" the material they were taking in would be is clearly a disaster waiting to happen, as the assets represented by that pile of classified documents attract even further unwanted attention. So we must look at this first model of open government and say \"no, this is not it.\"\n\nThe harder question is to say why not. It's very hard to make an argument for most of government secrecy. All kinds of dodgy dealings in procurement, in service contracts, in suppression of stories which make the government look bad, in spying and dirty tricks against domestic dissidents, in supporting troublemakers in our allies' countries - all of this is routine, never mind the perhaps-more-defensible actual military/intelligence work which seems to be at the heart of the modern State in many cases. Why is the Assange Model, the Wikileaks Model, bad?\n\nThe answer is that the Assange Model is bad because it's anti-democratic. The leak cycle requires collusion between a handful of actors - a leaker (who has their own reasons), a leak-handler (the editors of Wikileaks, say), and then some number of publishers who're willing to handle the leaked material before it's made fully public. All of these people have their own motivations, their own agendas, and while \"the truth will set you free\" actually what we have is a technical elite with their own filter bubbles acting to \"correct\" democracy. It's not actually that different to Big Media picking-and-choosing which stories to run: the Wikileaks model is, at best, Aggressive Investigative Journalism. It might have a role to play in a more general ecology of news and the formation of public opinion, although I certainly wonder about the sustainability, risks and long-term effects, but it's no substitute for democratic participation. <strong>Counter-conspiracy is not the answer.</strong>\n\nThis is a very, very sharp and slippery line: to say that openness of information is necessary for informed voting is one thing. To say that leaking what is true is therefore a support of democracy is another. Without a clear understanding - a transparent one - of how leaks are prioritized and spun before release, Wikileaks remains just another media channel. And it's this line - an \"open source espionage / press agency\" which the political groundwork was clearly not done on. The deep questions about power and transparency (or, at least, accountability) within Wikileaks were not raised, and so it has fallen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>The Aid Transparency Model</h2>So let's look at another model of Open Government: the Open Data movement. I can't speak for the whole of this, I only have experience in one area: Opening Data on foreign aid, often just called Aid Transparency. I've worked for one charity doing work in this area, and I've had substantial contact with a few others. There's a problem, it's big, it's hairy, and I think there's a lot to learn from it.\n\nHere's the unpopular truth: most aid is wasted. There are horror stories, well-told by people like <a href=\"http://poptech.org/popcasts/kevin_starr_lasting_impact\">Kevin Starr</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGiHU-agsGY\">David Damburger</a> who describe, in these videos, the fullness of the Aid Problem. The stories are horrific: products hailed as breakthroughs which are simply unused 90% because they don't work very well in the real world, or wells dug and dug again by different international agencies who never talk to each-other, and never come back to check their work later. This situation is costing a lot of lives, and, worse, calling into question the existence of international aid.\n\n<em>If we stand up and speak the truth about what is broken</em>, so the argument goes, <em>we'll lose our funding and more people will die</em>. And this kind of thinking has gone on for generations of aid workers, become a sort of <strong>amoral corporate philosophy</strong>, taught to and then bred into each new round of do-gooders by their organizational forebears, making sure that the party line will never change: <strong>Aid is Perfect, give us More Money, and let us Get On With Saving the World</strong>.\n\nBut, in truth, the aid game is being challenged on all sides. Cell phones mean locals can call up when their well fails. SMS messages from refugee camps arrive on the phones of high officials. Donors demand greater transparency because they *know* damn well the data can be collected at marginal costs now. The Big Lie of the aid world - <em><strong>keep silent about our mistakes, because we're saving lives by keeping our mouth shut when we screw up</strong></em> - is coming apart at the seams under the weight of more transparency. The parallels to Wikileaks successes and failures are informative and ironic.\n\nHere we see the same kind of mission-critical, life-or-death systems being disrupted by transparency, by the same forces which Julian Assange sought to point at government. It's all about the power of information to move money, the power of secrecy to hide bad practice. In the aid world, however, rather than a semi-secret cabal making the publishing decisions, the pressure for transparency comes over an extremely broad front, from individual donors who are slowly asking to know more about where the money goes, through to groups beginning to campaign for more honesty about failures in the field, through to improved communications facilitating full communications from remote areas, helping to keep everyone on the same team.\n\nThe broad, even nature of the pressure in aid is a critical difference to the Wikileaks model. A central \"aid goof clearing house\" structured like Wikileaks would clearly be pernicious - more secrecy, tighter control of information about errors, harsher political climate etc. would all be the costs for such an agency's existence, even if it did occasionally reveal truly hideous wrong-doing in the course of business. The structure itself, of centralizing the point of openness in hidden hands, clearly negates its own best objectives.\n\nThis is an old lesson which every generation of political campaigners must learn: you must unify the ends and the means. If the goal is peace, the method must be peace. If the goal is openness, the method must be openness. My own work is flawed in many areas, but at least in a few key places, I've unified goal-and-method well enough to be going on with. It is hard, but is is possible.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>The STAR-TIDES model</h2>Civil cooperation with government is another model of openness. Again, I'll talk about this in an aid / disaster relief context, because that's what I know, and I'll try to draw out a couple of key points rather than getting into all the technical details of it.\n\nMy experience in this area is startling, not least to me: I helped to open up the Pentagon. Now, this is a very, very general statement, to the point of being wrong, so let's try that again: I helped to demonstrate the power of Free/Open Source Appropriate Technology to network theorists inside of the US Military's intellectual wing, who were persuaded by my work and the work of many others that being decisively more open and networked in dealing with humanitarian crisis would be a Good Thing, and over a few years, started a program called STAR-TIDES to implement that.\n\n<a href=\"http://star-tides.net\">STAR-TIDES</a> was always an unlikely beast - serious military talking to civilian volunteers and aid workers as peers, in a cooperative effort to figure out which technologies and best practices would be good to use and scale in disaster areas. But, and this is really critical, STAR-TIDES has generally been very successful by sticking to a few general principles.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>open what can be opened - know-how about tools and systems</li>\n\n<li>stay away from the messy operational end - share knowledge, but don't get involved in actual relief ops directly</li>\n\n<li>work with everybody who can use the same licenses and basic operating agreements</li>\n\n<li>be clear about what's non-negotiable - STAR-TIDES is, fundamentally, there to make the military better at disaster relief, not to fix the world.</li>\n\n</ol>Now this kind of open cooperation raises some interesting issues indeed. Firstly, why not just hire the appropriate civilians to do these jobs? Why work with volunteers. The answers to that are complex, but revolve around two problems. Firstly, the money is too slow, it's often years or even a decade before a good idea can get enough funding to hire staff to implement it if the idea is at all radical. More pervasive, and subtle, however, is the Wikipedia Problem - no government on earth could have created wikipedia, even on an unlimited budget. Volunteer cooperation is just more powerful than other systems of engagement in some ways. There needs to be work done on how not to burn out / abuse volunteer labour, but there's no denying that people who are there just to solve the problem, with no personal interest whatsoever, are a fundamentally powerful force particularly when working together in large groups as with Wikipedia. There is real power here, and it comes from good intentions.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>The General Model: Open Government</h2>Finally, let's discuss the most general case of open government: publish everything the government does and knows, in convenient machine-readable formats, on the basis that it is being done on behalf of the public, the same public who paid for it, the public that has a right to know. This public is poorly served by inefficient, opaque government. A government which pays for buses, but doesn't publish the GPS data on where each bus is. A government which commissions school meals, but won't say what's in them. A government which knows which hospitals are safer than others for a given operation, but won't tell you.\n\nThe simple truth here is that \"couldn't know\" was the answer 50 years ago, because it was incredibly expensive to prepare and publish accurate data. It would have crippled the State. Today's answer, of \"shouldn't know\" is based on nothing more than the convenience of bureaucrats. And I say that with all due respect: some of my best friends are bureaucrats! But it is the simple, brutal, cold truth: every time the government says \"you can't know that\" about something which you are paying for, outside of a narrow defense arena, what they really mean is \"it's inconvenient for us for you to know that.\"\n\nGovernment does not exist to serve its own interests, it exists to serve our interests. Open Data is without a doubt a simple and direct rendering of eternal democratic principles using the technologies of our age. There might be all kinds of implementation details and privacy issues which need to be addressed case-by-case, but there is absolutely no doubt that a conventional framing of the responsibilities of the individual and the State cannot escape the necessity of Open Government. We need to know in order to be able to cast our votes in an informed manner, and the State requires an informed and wise population to continue to be healthy.\n\nThink about that.\n\nWe need to know so we can vote accurately.\n\nThe State needs us to know so that we can vote accurately.\n\nThat mutual obligation, around clear understanding of What Is Really Going On, between government and citizens is coming under serious and sustained pressure on all sides. Political radicals of all stripes - and I've made this mistake myself - want to give up on democracy and overhaul everything from the ground up without giving the system a chance to right itself.\n\nThe turning point for me, where I re-invested in the democratic process, was when the Pirate Party got 10% of the votes in the most recent German election. That's the point where I knew that, at least in Germany, the system is still workable.\n\nI will tell you my Pirate Party story in another post soon, but for now, here's a parting thought:\n\nIt's our responsibility to know so we can vote properly - how could any bureaucrat not want that?\n\n<strong>Democracy requires Open Government.</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-23 15:35:35",

joiner or activist, in the sense of attending demonstrations.\u00a0 In my experience the fastest way to get anyone to do anything is for me to try persuading them to do the exact opposite.\n\nWhat I do is analysis and writing, extrapolating from trends and correlating them, and tying ideas together in explanatory frameworks.\u00a0 I put other people's ideas together in new structures.\n\nThe main subject of my research is networked resistance movements, the use of network communications technology as a tool of asymmetric warfare, and the ways in which networked associations of free people are supplanting authoritarian state and corporate hierarchies and becoming the nucleus of a new society.\n\nI keep track of what networked movements like the Arab Spring, the Indignados, Madison, Occupy,\u00a0 etc., are doing, and the tactical innovations they develop, and try to draw as much attention as I can to the significance of it.\n\nEver since Wikileaks published its huge cache of U.S. State Department cables, I've watched with growing hope as it sparked first the uprising in Tunisia, then the Arab Spring, Occupy, and who knows what's next.\u00a0 This\u00a0 is the most hopeful time I've ever lived in.\n\nMost of my analysis of the Revolution 2.0 movements around the world can be found, in far more coherent form than I could reproduce here, in my news commentary columns for Center for a Stateless Society.\u00a0 So I'll try to summarize here, but provide links to a more readable analysis.\n\n\"<a href=\"http://c4ss.org/content/8914\">The Stigmergic Revolution</a>\"\n\n\"<a href=\"http://c4ss.org/content/9231\">Occupy Doesn't Have a Platform -- It Is a Platform</a>\"\n\nThe beauty of all these networked movements is that they're stigmergically organized -- that is, organized on a module/platform basis -- so that individual cells can act independently on their own initiative without waiting for permission, or waiting for the administrative apparatus at some legacy institutionalized social movement to get everyone on the same page before anyone can do anything.\u00a0\n\nAs with Wikipedia, there's a long tail in contributions.\u00a0 That is, there's no minimum size to the contribution one can make, and no entry barrier or transaction cost in making any contribution one wants.\u00a0 A networked organization can leverage large and small contributions, that previously wouldn't have been worth aggregating.\u00a0 This \"long tail\" also applies to the direction of activism, as local cells and spinoffs can attack any target or cause that suits their own grievances and inclinations, using the basic \"Occupy\" brand as a common platform to support their\u00a0 own modular movement.\n\nAlso like Wikipedia, the transaction costs of propagating and adopting tactical innovations falls to zero.\u00a0 Any innovation developed by any node in the network, based on its own expertise and interest, immediately becomes the property of the whole network, to be adopted by any node that (on its own initiative) finds it useful.\u00a0 To take the example of an earlier (and not so nice) stigmergic movement, Al Qaeda Iraq, when any local cell developed a new form of Improvised Explosive Device, it was rapidly adopted by cells all over Iraq.\u00a0 The record industry mistakenly thought it only had to make its DRM good enough to thwart the average user, and the geeks capable of cracking it would be too numerically insignificant to matter.\u00a0 The problem was, as soon as the geeks cracked it it immediately became available for anyone in the world who understood how to\u00a0 do a torrent download.\n\nThe same is true of the networked resistance movements that sprang up in 2011.\u00a0 A hierarchical, administratively mediated system -- like Homeland Security, the TSA, the MPAA/RIAA, local police forces confronting demonstrators, etc. -- has enormous transaction costs involved in analyzing a situation and formulating a response to it, or in developing and approviing innovations.\u00a0 A networked movement, in contrast -- because of the stigmergic organization mentioned in the previous paragraph -- adapts and changes with the speed of replicating yeast, and throws off new innovations like a plutonium atom throws off neutrons.\n\nBecause of networks' lightning-fast reaction time and agility, they are (in the phrase of the late military strategist John Boyd) able to \"get inside the OODA loop\" of authoritarian institutions.\u00a0 That is, they react faster than do hierarchies, and stay one step ahead, so that hierarchies are always off balance and trying to react to whatever's already happened instead of taking the initiative.\n\nFor example, some local Occupy movemets, in response to camp shutdowns by riot police in heavy combat gear, realized that they themselves were like light infantry, whereas the riot cops were the equivalent of slow-moving heavy infantry with a cumbersome supply train.\u00a0 So all they had to do was evacuate a park or square, lead the cops on a wild goose chase through town, then move quickly back to the park and wait for the cops to return hours later.\u00a0 Lather, rinse, repeat.\u00a0 A lot like Mao's\u00a0 rules for a guerilla army--retreat when the enemy advances, and attack the enemy where he is not.\n\nAnother example of rapid innovation that has caught \"authorities\" by surprise is the Occupy Our Homes movement to put homeless or foreclosed people in vacant bank-owned housing.\n\nA\u00a0 great quality of these networked movements is that they're simply platforms empowering the nodes that participate in them, rather than an institutionalized \"movement\" with a set of demands.\u00a0 Critics of Occupy on the traditional Left, who say it has no leaders and no demands, miss the point.\u00a0 Occupy is a platform and a brand.\u00a0 It is united only by its common hatred of neoliberal corporate capitalism, but has as many specific agendas as there are walks of life among its participants.\u00a0 So they can pursue their own particular agendas and grievances against the corporate state, like a swarm of piranha, using the common platform of Occupy for their own purposes.\n\nOccupy is also important as the seed for a new society.\u00a0 Less important than what the big Occupy camps do in their protests is what they do among themselves, as associations of the people in a given community.\u00a0 I hope they will evolve into something like the neighborhood assemblies of Argentina -- schools for living, or fairs, that propagate toolkits for building new local economies and counter-institutions outside the framework\u00a0 of the corporate state.\u00a0 Far more important than the original Occupy camps is what the movement will do, like dandelion seeds dispersed in the wind, now that the sites are shut down.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-23 21:21:29", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:44:48.510588", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false,

We organize practical workshops for children from all backgrounds to get them in touch with biology in a fun way. We do this because the role of biological technologies will become increasingly bigger as we move towards a circular society. Education plays a fundamental role in allowing people to be a part of this process.\n\nWhy are we doing this? My personal motivation is best shown through\u00a0a memory from my biotechnological engineering studies. We went on a company visit to Monsanto. At the time, I was not particularly aware of the dirty business they were in. We got to see the production facility, water treatment installations and large glyphosate tanks, which are all used to produce Roundup. During the luxurious lunch, which Monsanto employees also attended, a fellow student whispered to me: \u201chow can they sleep at night, considering they work for such a questionable company?\u201d. That was the only thing that I heard about the issue from anyone at school, both teachers or students. I didn\u2019t (now to my shame) know anything about Monsanto at the time and had to look it up myself afterwards. I was baffled and disgusted. What are we teaching our students?\n\nAside from the perspective we teach, relevance is important as well. I hated biology in high school. If you had told me I\u2019d be a bioengineer someday, I would have laughed in disbelief. The content of biology class often remains descriptive (you\u00a0learn about the parts of a plant cell), while higher education and jobs are all about application (you use these plant cells to grow something useful, like a building). A child that likes\u00a0engineering, design and coding should consider\u00a0studying biology. This is fundamental if we want enough people to develop sustainable technologies for the future.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/290db74661f062dfcecf295700a1a5ff75b2183b.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\nReaGent has been going for about a year. We\u2019ve experimented with several ways to bring biology closer to society. We've had children work with enzymes, build\u00a0their own microscope, extract DNA and much more.\u00a0The coming year, we will expand to reach more children and this scale-up entails several challenges.\n\n<strong>Cell division</strong>\n\nAs a first step, we have decided to continue the project under a new name: <strong>Ecoli</strong>. The DIY biolab in Ghent will stay as ReaGent, while Ecoli will provide biology education to children and underprivileged groups. A DIYbio space or biohackerspace and child education are not very compatible regarding administrative or legal aspects, like insurance and licenses. Another reason for the split is the different story we want to tell.\n\nThe story to inspire a citizen scientist or biohacker is different from the story to inspire a child. Moreover, DIYbio has had issues with public perception. We find it important that knowledge is spread equally and that everyone can participate in an open discussion. We would not like a distorted image to shape decisions and opinions of people, leading them to self-censor and potentially miss out on learning opportunities.\n\nThe creativity, mindset and <a href=\"https://diybio.org/codes/draft-diybio-code-of-ethics-from-european-congress/\">ethics</a>\u00a0present in a DIYbio lab strengthen and form the way we educate. We feel like we get the benefits without the drawbacks if the DIY biolab and educational project are two separate entities.\n\n<strong>Funding education in a fair way</strong>\n\nThe question that I posed in the initial post\u00a0was on how to fund education outside of, but as an addition to, the traditional state-funded system.\n\nMaking a project like this financially sustainable is a challenge. The groups where we have our biggest impact, and thus create the most value, are also least capable of paying for it. We have set up a way to partially fund this by doing workshops in the classical school circuit. Our impact there is equally important and they can afford to pay (a little) for our services. It remains to be seen if we can sustain ourselves in the long term.\n\nChances are, we\u00a0will\u00a0have to find funds elsewhere \u2013government or industry. Government is the obvious choice, since education falls under their responsibility. Though, as often with government, it would be na\u00efve to count on funding. Additionally, it entails somewhat of an administrative burden (especially in Belgium and the EU) and it\u2019s a slow process.\n\nSo, do we want to cooperate with big biotech companies? How will this affect what we want to achieve with Ecoli? Do we risk that public opinion, or opinions of parents, ultimately influences\u00a0what a child learns? Biotech has plenty of shortcomings \u2013<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/9/22/9366721/daraprim-price-shkreli-turing\">funding and market mechanisms</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-genetically-modify-human-embryos-1.17378\">ethical</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_kahn_gene_editing_can_now_change_an_entire_species_forever?language=en\">ecological</a>\u00a0and the list goes on. But it\u2019s a technology, a tool that can be used for good and bad. The drawbacks that I mentioned are effects of the way it is used and not inherent to the technology. If we are scared of biotech, it is because we are scared of ourselves, and rightfully so.\n\nWe still have the option of telling a nuanced story. Especially if we can highlight these issues during education, which is a rarity. My personal Monsanto experience is only one example.\n\n<strong>Caring with science</strong>\n\nMore fundamentally, care is everyone\u2019s responsibility in one way or another. Earlier this week, one of our team members went to visit an institute that accompanies people with a mental disability. He visited them to explain what we do and to offer them biology workshops for their audience, the responsible\u2019s jaw dropped as she launched off in enthusiasm, pointing out all the ways we could cooperate. She said nobody ever thought of deeming their people worthy of science oriented workshops. Even if it\u2019s just for entertainment, science or technology can be used for care. People have a tendency to underestimate capabilities of certain groups, like little kids or special needs people. On the other hand, there\u2019s a tendency to overestimate the intelligence required to grasp or play with basic principles. The power lies in how it\u2019s communicated.\n\nThis is only one of plenty of groups that don\u2019t get equal chances for quality education. It is part of the mission of Ecoli to provide those groups the opportunity to learn and discover.\n\n<strong>Beyond the tools</strong>\n\nWe are likely at the start of a similar revolution like the digital revolution. That means we have the chance to try and anticipate this time round; to try and prepare people; to embed values, like openness and inclusiveness, that make sure we don\u2019t need to fix the problems of accessibility and literacy afterwards.\n\nWhat we do can be considered an experiment and in many ways, it\u2019s not necessarily about biology. We hope that, in addition to growing a basic biological literacy, we help to build\u00a0a shift in attitude. When we watch global developments, it is clear that the biggest problems we face don\u2019t require technological solutions. Even problems that are directly caused by a misuse of technology, like climate change, could be headed towards a solution by changing our attitude, especially when combined with more sustainable bio-based technologies. A change in behaviour is not likely to happen overnight, but if we can build institutions that promote caring, collaboration and trust, we might be on our way.\n\nWe are engaging with the Edgeryders community because we hope our actions can be part of a bigger solution. One where different actors work on improving their respective fields. By sharing experiences of our project with the Edgeryders community we hope we can grow more resilience for everyone.\n\nWe will be attending the workshop in Brussels on the 24<sup>th</sup> of September and would be delighted to meet you!\n\nIf you connect to our story, let us know! We love feedback and discussing the subject. Here\u2019s some other questions that occupy our mind. Should this type of initiative stay an addition to the state-funded system? Is this form of bottom-up activism, independent of the government or in spite of it, ultimately a desirable strategy?\n\n<i>The production of this\u00a0article was supported by\u00a0<a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\">Op3n\u00a0Fellowships</a>\u00a0-\u00a0an ongoing program for community contributors\u00a0during May - November 2016.</i>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-04 22:55:24", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 14:19:49.594261", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1576, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1350, "user_id": 265, "topic_id": 1317, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>A PROJECT BY </strong>\n\nOrganization: Upper Space\n\nWebsite: <a href=\"http://www.upper-space.org\">www.upper-space.org</a>\n\nBlog: <a href=\"http://www.upper-space.org/blog\">www.upper-space.org/blog</a>\n\nTwitter: @upper_space\n\nWe have created a new framework for an experimental street art project that will explore the relationships between the arts, citizens and the public realm. The AOSD project is a timely response to the threats posed by aggressive consumerism and consumption to global ecosystems and cultural value systems. The project is a radical form of counteraction to the pervasive nature of outdoor advertising, consumer culture and the privatisation of our public spaces. The AOSD project will be in several phases with the first phase commencing in Feb 2012.\n\n<strong>Phase 1: Culture Jamming - Art as Social Activism. (funding approved)</strong>\n\nUpper Space has developed an experimental art project that will see a nationwide reclamation of unlawful advertising space across the UK. Our research for this phase is highlighting large scale outdoor advertisements that are in direct infringement of UK planning law and mapping their locations within city centres as we seek to reclaim and replace these images with art works that appeal to our shared intrinsic values rather than the extrinsic values that consumerism is so heavily exposing people to.\n\nThis first phase will see the installation of socially and environmentally conscious art works in 5 UK cities by a range of UK artists. By priming alternative 'signals' to the wider public in these spaces the AOSD project will encourage new debate and discourses about the pervasive effect of advertising within a global society at a time when the effects of our unrestrained consumption are becoming increasingly felt - both at home and in areas that are more sensitive to the effects of climate change.\n\nThis phase of the project will be documented for release online in both still and moving image with the creation of a documentary that will contextualise the main themes of the project with support from academic, third sector and arts representatives. We will be communicating academic theory in a 'bite size' format for wider transmission.\n\n<strong>Phase 2: Ad-Free Towns: The reclaimation of the public realm. (funding needed)</strong>\n\nIt\u2019s time to reclaim our public places from commercial advertising, and create breathing space for creative, community-oriented communications in their stead. We want to support local communities in doing this.\n\nAd-free Towns will thus involve Upper Space and the Public Institute Research Centre (PIRC) producing a web platform and online toolkit to support communities in reclaiming space from advertising, and fund a part-time administrator to maintain the website and interface with local groups:\n\n\u25cf An online toolkit would help people organise and campaign in their area to control the advertising they are exposed to. The toolkit would contain information on community organising, building a campaign, and using local and national media to create a buzz around the issue. It would also contain detailed advice on using Freedom of Information laws to obtain data from local authorities on outdoor advertising, show how to complain about an advert to the Advertising Standards Authority, and explain how to find out whether a billboard has planning permission or not.\n\n\u25cf A web platform for community groups and individuals who want to challenge advertising in their area. This would provide a vibrant place in which people can access information about advertising in their locale, share success stories, tips and news, and allow groups to link up so they feel part of a shared nationwide campaign. The website would be developed by PIRC working with an experienced web developer, and road-tested with a number of community groups. Potential website features include:\n\n\u25cb A Googlemap of all billboards in UK, using a geocoded dataset of advertising hoarding locations, allowing users to see exactly how many outdoor ads they are exposed to;\n\n\u25cb Data on how much is spent to hire each and every billboard hoarding, plus info on how multinational outdoor advertising companies like CBS Outdoor and JCDecaux profit from their placement, rather than money going to local communities;\n\n\u25cb Downloadable smartphone app, making it easy for users to upload photos of specific billboard adverts to the Googlemap - and start to see whether there are patterns in the ways companies advertise, such as ads for junk food near schools;\n\n\u25cb The ability to create local groups, initiate campaigns, add in contacts, and log actions - modelled on the successful example of Fix My Transport. This function would allow communities to quickly muster supporters, share\n\n<strong>Phase 3: Ad-Free City: The Sao Paulo effect. (in development)</strong>\n\nIn September 2006, the mayor of Sao Paolo - the largest city in Brazil, passed the Clean City laws that outlawed all outdoor advertising within the city centre. Upper Space is looking to pilot a similar initiative in the UK with one major difference. We are looking at the inclusion of creative and community orientated communications within the city that will transmit intrinsic messages to the public and utilise the arts as a cultural force for positive cultural behaviour change.\n\n<strong>There is more information available if needed and we are keen to meet with other organisations from across Europe to discuss, critically assess and develop this project.</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-24 11:59:17", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 10:50:19.055216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 923, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16297, "user_id": 3580, "topic_id": 6292, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>lab thread</b>\n\nI'm available for lab work starting June 26th.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-15 17:26:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.342910", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7479, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3479, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Great work!</b>\n\nThanks @danohu for getting started with this, I also added some contacts which we used for last year's conference.\n\nit might come in handy when we do a twitter press conference before Lote4.

Whole years go by. While others around you explore and bloom, you look in the mirror and there is nothing there to see. At some point, you realize that it could probably go on like this for decades: trapped in a kind of protected floating bubble, isolated from information and innovation, in part because of the language barrier. Citizens do not even know what they are missing, because they are kept in the dark. The society of silence extends to traditional media, who talk about everything except what is important.\n\nSometimes, some citizens get angry and try to protest. 200.000 of them, even 300.000 sign petitions. But petitions are ignored. People know that their actions were in vain. Therefore, they get less and less likely to protest at the next opportunity. Officials continue to do as they are pleased.\n\nI found nothing better to do than run away, in order to continue to do things that I love and hang on to my dreams. Otherwise, I'd be dead inside. At home, that I observe from my distant observatory, everything remains frozen in near immobility. This inaction is recognized and condemned by all. Not a week goes by without a significant take to lament the matter publicly.\n\nWhat is it we need? We need some form of cataclysm - to act as an adrenaline rush. Because simple rationality seems powerless to provoke the people, to the point that officials could accept such a vague concept as change. While change is synonymous with evolution, with its tendency to move slowly, what is desired by many, including myself, is speed.\n\n\"<em>The bond of trust between politicians and citizens is completely broken, and they want change,</em>\" said MP Bernard Landry. \u201c<em>Citizens want politicians to cease to be \"in [their] bubble</em>.\" (<a href=\"http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Politique/2011/08/25/002-drainville-pq-reforme-politique-citoyens.shtml\">ref</a>)\n\nWe need fresh air.

He does not have a Twitter account, and it is practically impossible to get in touch with him. I consider that it is not worth wasting one second to try to contact him.\n\nThe MP in charge of the open government analysis is 69 years old. He is currently on sick leave, recovering from surgery.\n\nThis recovering MP is also in charge of chairing the association of francophone parliamentarians. He is the Deputy Chairman of APF.\n\nThe MP which has been designated to completely terminate GovintheLab\u2019s opengov and Francophonie project is 71 years old. He represents the constituency in which I live (Maskinong\u00e9).\n\nThe Direction of the Francophonie as well as the Interparliamentary Affairs of the Department of International Relations, have ruled against the proposed GovintheLab\u2019s project. They said that they do not care about open government issues. They said that they have <em>other </em>priorities.\n\nThe secretary of the America section of the APF (Assembl\u00e9e r\u00e9gionale Am\u00e9rique de l'Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire de la Francophonie) said that he would not support the proposed GovintheLab\u2019s project, as long as the Deputy Chairman of the APF is not in favor of this project. He will block all attempts to contact the headquarters of APF, located in Paris.\n\nMembers of the Canadian Section of the APF explained to me that they do not take decision on any project whatsoever. They apparently simply sign documents. They wait for the Deputy Chairman (of Quebec) to decide what to do, and then they do like he does.\n\nAre all decisions concentrated on the shoulders of one government official, the Deputy Chairman of APF? He is no longer there, because he had to have surgery.\n\nThere was apparently no transfer of his responsibilities to someone else. The government chose instead to suspend projects and postpone to months later. Gautrin\u2019s report on the potential of Web 2.0, which was to be delivered on December 15, 2011, has not been delivered yet.\n\nBlock and freeze. That is what this government does.\n\nTherefore, even though Quebec is hosting an important OIF event in the spring, all exits are blocked. I had hoped that we could have succeeded in including the topic of open government at the agenda of the first OIF Forum on the French language (<a href=\"http://www.forumfrancophonie2012.org\">Forum mondial de la langue fran\u00e7aise</a>, July 2-6, 2012, in Quebec City).\n\nThis forum is under the responsibility of the Minister of International relations. And this ministry has blocked the proposed GovintheLab\u2019s project.\n\nAt the French language Forum, it would have been possible to meet with many delegates from the 75 member States of the OIF.\n\nIn addition, GovintheLab presented an experimental incubator open government project to the G8 G20 Youth Summits (http://g8-g20-youth-summits.org) organized by Youth Diplomacy.\u00a0 Therefore, we would have had a project already designed. This draft project could have been adapted to the context of the OIF forum. <span><span>This</span> <span>could</span> have <span>helped us</span> <span>prepare the ground, by</span> <span>submitting</span> to as many delegates as possible, <span>the idea of</span> <span>including the topic</span> of open government </span>at the next OIF Summit.\n\nFurthermore, the Premier Jean Charest, responsible for Youth, invited in Quebec, in the Fall of 2011, the French minister of Digital economy, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ric_Besson\">Eric Besson</a>. This minister visited for a week facilities of the Plan Nord (see this <a href=\"http://www.consulfrance-quebec.org/Eric-Besson-ministre-charge-de-l\">press release</a> by the Consulat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France au Qu\u00e9bec, and this article by Radio-Canada <a href=\"http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Economie/2011/10/05/010-charest-fillon-plan-nord.shtml\">announcing that France and Quebec signed a deal</a>, and this other article about <a href=\"http://affairessansfrontieres.bwob.ca/secteurs-d-activite/ressources-naturelles/la-france-veut-devenir-le-partenaire-no-1-du-quebec/\">France's goal to become Quebec's No.1 Partner</a>).\n\nSubsequently, the Premier of Quebec was also invited to France, and was welcomed by the Minister of the digital economy. They spent more time together.\n\nNot a word was exchanged about open data and open government perspectives during these numerous meetings.\n\nDuring the visit the Minister Besson in Quebec, he contacted me directly (via Twitter) and agreed that I transmit him GovintheLab\u2019s project. He put me in touch with his office. I sent information about the project, but I never received a response. Many citizens from around the world have seen the minister discuss with me on Twitter, and they showed solidarity. But it stopped there. There was no follow up from any government official of the French Republic.\n\nThe command, to get open government on the agenda of the next OIF Summit, was back on my desk last week.\n\nI cannot do it. There are too many roadblocks. And I'm tired of volunteering lobbying without receiving any financial support. I cannot continue like this. Since the refusal of the project, on September 1st, 2011, I gave up everything. I no longer lift a finger. In any case, even if I tried, the man on whom everything depends\u2026 is gone. And the others are too preoccupied with making money with the Plan Nord.\n\nDo you have suggestions?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-29 15:31:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.347889", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1066, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25172, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 4897, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Haven't messed with the featured task</b>\n\nDunnot know who changed it.

The tax credits idea has been proposed by Yanis himself <a href=\"http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/02/15/bitcoin-a-flawed-currency-blueprint-with-a-potentially-useful-application-for-the-eurozone/\">here</a>, but he proposed to let people buy them for Euros and redeem for face value in money any time, and alternatively for, say, 120% their face value in tax payments on maturity (2 years). That still requires people to <em>have</em> Euros to pay at least some taxes, so it won't happen for the 69 billion EUR outstanding tax debt. With your idea however, these can be recovered at least in part. And at the same time, it plays along with the conditions on the ground in Greece: lots and lots of soup kitchens, medical services etc. which took over former functions of the state and are run by volunteers and on donation basis, also in-kind. Syriza would like the state to take on these functions again and \"solve the social emergency\", but there's very little money for it. Paying it from outstanding tax debts in-kind by re-framing and re-inforcing the civil solidarity movement that provides these functions at the moment anyway is kinda ingenious :) So I'll put that into the proposal, not paying public employees 20% in barter value.\n\nFrom this starting point, adding more flexibility to such economic exchanges is either possible by making tax vouchers tradeable like a currency, or by using network barter. Tradeable vouchers would allow anyone to pay their taxes in-kind, by trading stuff for such circulating vouchers, which costs the government real money in cases where tax debt could be enforced to be paid in money. So, tradeable vouchers are only an attractive option when they are bought in money as in Yanis' proposal. With network barter, vouchers would not be tradeable, they'd rather be immediate tax debt reduction and would be available only to those who qualify as having unenforceable tax debts.\n\nHaha I really like this :) We \"found\" up to 60 billion EUR to fight the Greek social emergency. Debt towards the government is transformed from something that cripples the economy and makes small businesses close for good to a tool for government to say: \"Look people, we have a lot of problems, there's a lot to do in this society, and you <em>have</em> to do it, and you <em>can</em> do it because without a full job you have the time.\" Underemployment, tax debts and social crisis are problems that could just cancel each other out.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-25 18:37:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.047394", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 465, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23063], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32148, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>@Patrick_Andrews, please</b>\n\n@Patrick_Andrews, please accept my apologies for my initial reactions.

If you felt that it was, then i apologise.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe conversations you have just seen, and the behaviour that was exhibited, is symptomatic of the growing pains that every group goes through, when it is changing.\n\nThere have been a number of conflicts within the Edgeryders community caused by the set-up and forms-of-management-used by Edgeryders LBG.\u00a0 @Alberto's refusal to consider a co-operative legal structure, due to his bad experiences with co-operatives that were taken over by the mafia, is a good example.\n\nThere have also been a number of problems caused by the differences in approach used by the different members of Edgeryders, both in face-to-face situations, and in online conversations. @Ben's comments about the problems in the relationships with the locals in Matera, is one example. @Nadia's actions in un-publishing threads because she was worried about her professional relationships with her customers is another example.\n\nOne of the other problems we have is the lack of transparency, and un-democratic behaviour, that is inherent in the way this website is run. This is partially a technical problem, but also, a social problem that cannot be solved with a technical solution.\n\nAnother problem is the requirements of the funding providers, and potential partners, that can conflict with the things that we require, and how these requirements conflict with the range of potential solutions that we want to consider, and the transparency that we should be using. There are also effective solutions that funders will NOT consider, because of the changes that would have to be made to the funder provider's own systems.\n\nWhich also leads to the question, of whether we should be working with them in the first place.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTrying to deal with all of these problems during a background of austerity in the EU, the legacies of colonialism, the rising inequities caused by the current neo-liberal economics, as well as the looming situation with climate change, means that the idea that \"we need to do things differently\" is important, because if the way things are currently being done was working, then these problems wouldn't exist.\n\nIf we can't fix the simple problems that we have as a community, then how will people take us seriously, when we talk about the larger problems?\n\nAll of our respective credibilities took a serious hit this weekend.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-25 12:04:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.705134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 570, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12106, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2907, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\n:)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-02 07:38:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.199164", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9919], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31603, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3250, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Travel schedule from Matera to Nursia</b>\n\nTreno: Frecciargento \u00a09354 \u00a0 del \u00a005/09/2014\n\nPartenza: Bari Centrale (Ore: 13:17); Arrivo: Roma Termini (Ore: 17:20).\n\nTreno: Regionale Veloce \u00a02488 \u00a0 del \u00a005/09/2014\n\nPartenza: Roma Termini (Ore: 17:58); Arrivo: Spoleto (Ore: 19:31)\n\nping <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\u00a0and whoever wants to travel from the unMonastery to the cradle of monasticism.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-29 16:43:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.751958", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 83, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19104, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1458, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>:D</b>\n\nAnd nope, you didn't.\n\n*You* are funny, too, Sir :D Ok, then, second guess:\n\nYou're proposing a quite masochist project of mining our own data in order to demonstrate to ourselves and to the world that \"This is privacy.

This period of relative calm seems like a good time for reflection, so I wanted to touch base and share some thoughts.\n\nTo my sisters and brothers in South Africa I wish to extend my condolences for the loss of your beloved Madiba. The world was lucky we got to keep and learn from him for as long as we did. We are going to need to remember those lessons as we move into a year of rising intolerance, populism and discontent all over the planet.\n\nWhile Mr. Mandela's passing may mark the <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2013/12/06/for-my-generation-the-death-of-mandela-marks-the-end-of-africas-liberation-struggle-thandika-mkandawire/\">end of one generation's struggle for liberation</a>, all is not well. The new generation of activists is faced with different struggles: societies failure to come up with credible responses to systemic crises and the growing empathy gap in a time of growing economic inequality and social distance. The good news is that there are a lot of creative responses happening at the edges. Network bartering algorithms to ease consequences of liquidity constraints on local economies. New kinds of infrastructures for plugging gaps in innovation support systems. Re-engineering water supply and food systems to bolster food security. New p2p funded encrypted services and digital infrastructure to safeguard user privacy. And these are just a few examples from the Edgeryders community. I come across incredible initiatives everyday, built by people acting far outside structured R&amp;D processes of corporations and university laboratories.\n\nThe bad news is that these efforts to innovate our way out of social-ecological, economic and political crises are increasingly coming under threat. To anyone who has tried to gain acceptance for a novel idea or approach, the fact that <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1457&amp;context=articles\">people are biased against creative ideas</a> comes as no surprise. While some social rejection can foster resilience, it seems our societies are becoming less tolerant of our young innovators like Pirate Bay spokesperson and Flattr co-founder Peter Sunde and the now deceased Aaron Swartz, founder of Reddit. Intolerance and authoritarian extremism are on the rise, on the streets but also in the corridors of power. Examples include excessive surveillance and governments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/25/quebec-spain-anti-protest-laws-democracy\">attempts to curtail protest rights</a> or push through international trade agreements like ACTA and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership#Criticism\">TTIP</a> without democratic debate.\n\nWhats going on, have policymakers and legislators suddenly turned evil? I don't think so.\n\nIt is clear the current generation of leadership in business and politics is not equipped to navigate the new techno-social realities within which they operate, no matter how well-meaning they are. A recently published report called <a href=\"http://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/hauptgutachten/jg2011/wbgu_jg2011_en.pdf\">World in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability </a>highlights the importance of \u201cfringe change agents\u201d in shifting paradigms (The report was produced by a think tank that advises the German Federal Government). They're still future-shocked by globalisation and the unprecedented degree of connectivity. They need our support.\n\nSo how can we help them adapt? One way is to build bridges between the centre and the edges where radical innovation is happening. This is not a hopeless battle, it is what we do everyday. Edgeryders is fostering the diffusion of new ideas, perspectives and behaviours from innovators at the edges to decision makers at the centre. On top of Edgeryders' many achievements listed below, my nomination for candidacy to the Swedish Parliament in 2014 is one of the many signs we are making progress.\n\n<b><b><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"388px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A95P-Y02ZhEj5ZKJcOxmx8wUqubvaZ4cc1SqXZIBhTOKDRKXvsW__yJ3Bsey3YaItc-oN8UX7Btp5Cqkq3xH4308g4aDt3hoEuBgHXGcj0z0ch2VSn-4nBpIaw\" width=\"525px;\"></b></b>\n\n<em>Phases of social diffusion of ideas and behaviours, and the roles of change agents in the transformation process.

But even better, I noticed Dorotea has set up a <a href=\"/t/lote3/312-travel-accommodation-practical-arrangements\">group for travel and practical arrangements</a> - with wiki pages for everyone to fill in their details,\u00a0and already\u00a0I saw ERs doing that. How about building on this infrastructure? Knowing what Materani offer and incoming ERs needs, someone (maybe Elf?)\u00a0could create posts in that group announcing what offers we have and if anyone is up for taking them, and start doing the matching as we go. Waiting until September to get back to Materani with details i think it's a bit too long, considering all the excitement just now.. or am i wrong?\n\nAngelsfortravellers seems quite a nice space and because it's mostly an\u00a0Italian speaking community, a\u00a0idea is for <strong>the two of\u00a0us or more volunteers </strong>to\u00a0go in and represent Edgeryders. this is an additional way of finding resources on site, but \u00a0it might be too big an effort for people to register for Lote here on edgeryders and register to get\u00a0accommodation help and directions on yet another platform..\u00a0\n\nAs far as I followed we still don't have a coordinator for the party, but\u00a0[valentinabrogna] suggested a massive pasta party and workshop, so maybe she'd be interested in making a concrete proposal? \u00a0btw sounds yummy\u00a0:D\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-30 14:10:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:17.415143", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24683], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16652, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 5229, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Made some minor edits <a href=\"/u/kiravde\">@KiraVde</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-05 15:41:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.164459", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18915, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4196, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Since they open-sourced the software, they'll be likely to open the rest of the documentation, including the costings.\n\n\"Back-of-a-beer-mat\" estimates for MVF,\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>1 server with a good reliable connection.</li>\n\n<li>1 WIFI module with SMS capabilities,</li>\n\n<li>1 SIM card with free text messaging..</li>\n\n<li>1 bicycle</li>\n\n<li>1 combination lock</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAll of this equipment is stuff that we have available already, or is borrow-able.\n\nWe'd have to add in more equipment, and better quality equipment,\u00a0 for the medium-to-long-term functionality, but for the initial playing-with-the-kit stage, it'll do for a functionality demo.\n\n<a class=\"mentions mentions-342\" href=\"/u/hexayurt\" title=\"hexayurt\">@hexayurt</a>, Would this be an interesting first App for Ethereum...?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-08 22:28:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.409190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 151, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18845], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32507, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5480, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Doing some intelligence work now</b>\n\nJust letting you guys know that I am trying to figure out what is behind this call.

We understand and appreciate that you may think of our city as the most boring place in Europe. But it\u2019s not. Admittedly, the weather sucks most of the time and there is a neighborhood filled with Eurocrats with big pockets and not enough urgency. That\u2019s just one neighborhood though, zooming out, you will see a very strange city. Only 1 million inhabitants, but due to all the immigration we are coping with a giant variety in cultures one of the largest rich-poor gaps in Europe. On these edges where rich and poor and a plurality of identities are meeting, very interesting projects are brewing. Sometimes literally, as there are many projects on beer.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Now that we know why Brussels is cool, let\u2019s talk about having failure as a theme. Or not necessarily as a theme, but as a guideline. Why are we so convinced this is a good idea?</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Because we\u2019ve been working with this theme for a year and, aside from a number of fuckups which you can read about in our <a href=\"http://www.antiheroes.org/#!freezer/c1mzt\">freezer</a>,</span><span> this is what has come out of \u00a0it:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>We\u2019ve held 7 FuckUp Nights Brussels.

You simply are not just that. So \u2026Who am I? I am so many things but this is what I\u2019d like to share about myself:\n\nI grew up in a village and that was for me the perfect environment to build myself up. In this village everybody knows everybody, you say hi when you meet people on the street, no matter if you talked before or not, you have to be polite and do good things cause in a way or another if you don\u2019t, you will feel the social pressure. It is a safe environment where one feels protected.\n\nMy parents sent me to boarding school when I was 10 years old in the city near by because they wanted me to attend a good and prestigious school. I started from then to decide things for myself and to assume responsibility for my actions. My parents supported me though, when I needed and they could. I attended a class specialized in mathematics but when I had to decide about high school I chose to attend the Pedagogical one that at it\u2019s end made me qualified to work as a pre-school, primary and English teacher for children. I learned a lot of theory mostly due to the charged curricula in our country and I did 2 years of practice. Still at practice all we did was teach our lesson and get out of the classroom and as a teacher you do so much more then that. I started then to volunteer for a foundation to learn what I felt was missing in my professional development but also I had to fulfill my need to be useful for someone else then myself.\n\n\u00a0I volunteered 3 years for children with muscular dystrophy and worked with them in their emotional recovery (for they were abandoned) and also joined in organizing the foundation events. And this motivated me to be more active: I started ball-room dancing, drawing classes and English courses all at the same time.\n\nWhen I graduated high school at 18 years old I took a contest for a pre-school teacher job. I got it and then I had to see how I was going to do both job and college studies. And I did great I was good as a pre-school teacher and I graduated top of my class my bachelor studies. I continued my job and started a MBA program that I am graduating this year.\n\nMy job as a pre-school teacher did not gave me the opportunity to value at a true level my knowledge acquired as a top graduate so I gladly said yes to a proposal for being an educational junior researcher. The offer was part-time until my contract at kindergarten expired when I was to become full-time employer. So in November this year I found myself doing two MBA programs and two jobs at once \u2026 and I still did great. I had straight A\u2019s at one MBA and only two B\u2019s at the other one and handled my jobs very well. I had so less sleep time but I was happy to be good at what I was involved in. When my contract at kindergarten expired my principal offered me the possibility to stay more. The deal with the others was that I would not stay anymore so I left what I did for 4 years an a half and become a full-time junior researcher. It was a hard thing to do.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Five months passed as part-time and I had still no papers for employment even when I crossed to full-time. Money came but no papers. Whenever I asked they circled the answer or say that they will fix it but never did. So I decided to resign. They offered me more money, the director position for one of their NGO\u2019s and the promise to fix my 5 months delayed papers. No drop of money or positions will buy my integrity. I resigned because I lost my trust in their intentions in everything they did and a few other reasons so I went in the same day to interview for a pre-school teacher job at a private kindergarten. I was told by the interviewer in the first sentences just by looking at my resume that I was over qualified. I applied at another kindergarten and I got the job. This one is new on market and will start when it will gather the enough number of children. Till then I am doing something \u2026.Now at 23 years old I am starting an educational NGO with experienced and enthusiastic people as partners. Two days ago I made the first legal step in developing it: I sent the name reservation to the Ministry of Justice. We are working every evening for 4-5 hours to lift it up. This one will be truly for the people, it will be fair and for myself I can guarantee that I will give 100% passion, experience and knowledge.\n\nTo be continued \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-09 11:51:42", "updated_at": "2017-09-02 11:31:25.100820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 927, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1926, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1893, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2013-09-06 16:15:21", "updated_at": "2018-05-21 11:31:19.103192", "deleted_at": "2018-10-01 22:15:21.398388", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29162, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1092, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Musing about a health group + \\#LOTE3 session </b>\n\nThe health topic is so big I can't chew it.

Since we are sharing goo.gl links, somebody (<a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia Skoczylas</a>?) should be seeing how much traffic those links are generated.\n\nI have already seen an increase in overall traffic starting approximately on July 21st, but what I am interested here is: what kind of headlines generate most engagement? LOTE4 stuff? Stories from the community? Events? What style seems to work best?\u00a0\n\nSpeaking about style, I would recommend to all the \\#countonme team to adapt Natalia's headlines to their own style. Me, for example, I have a down-to-earth style: I tend to stay away from the language of commercial communication \u2013 for example I rarely use words like \"amazing\" or \"awesome\". By adapting the headlines to my personal style, I both curate more my own feed and add personal credibility to the message, because my followers can tell that I am not copy-pasting. And this is important to them, and to all of your friends and followers too, because they chose to follow <em>you</em>, and are interested in what <em>you</em> have to say. When I have no time for curation, I just retweet someone else.\u00a0\n\nExample:\u00a0\n\n<em>Subtitling videos for Edgeryders is worth half of a fancy LOTE4 ticket http://goo.gl/xjZUb9</em>\n\nDoes not work for me. \"Fancy\" is not a word I use. Also, there are two things that I would improve: one, my followers typically don't know what the hell LOTE4 is (and probably neither do yours, it takes time for awareness to sink in; two, my followers know I care about collaboration, as much of my professional activity concerns policy-oriented, Internet-mediated, large scale collaboration, and my professional activity is the reason why my followers follow me. Hence my tweet:\n\n<em>The conference you can pay only in collaboration, not money: subtitling videos s worth half of a ticket! goo.gl/xjZUb9 \\#LOTE4</em>\n\nNow, that's better. It explains LOTE4 is a conference; it signals (by hashtag) that there is a feed about it; and it points out to its outstanding characteristic, namely that you pay in collaboration.\n\nDid it work?

Capital constraints: Obvious to all. \u00a0Money. \u00a0Groups can economize to almost unimaginable amounts (like at Findhorn and The Farm), but it also means there are all sorts of things you can't do.\n\n2. Burn-out: just like with any office refrigerator and dishes, some people are neater than others and some people care more than others about certain daily realities of the physical space and on to completely mental/psychological/relationship issues. \u00a0It is inevitable in any group that you will have a kind of bell curve of participation at the most basic levels of responsibility where some people take on anything and everything, most people do some, and some people don't do that much. \u00a0This is one of the most important reasons why certain things have to be worked out and talked through. \u00a0Putting a bunch of signs around and just being rule-enforcers might work when the large majority of people there are transient, but for a smaller more committed group, it can take on\u00a0a life of its own that can get to be a drag. \u00a0Plus, it wasn't said in that article, many of the intentional communities or collectives, are started by people in their younger adult years. \u00a0Sometimes the real story is people grow and change and their life goals shift.\n\n3. Conflict over private property and resource management: related to burnout and capital restraints. \u00a0This is a situaltion where I think it ought to get written down as to what the basic agreements are about who owns what and who is responsible for what. \u00a0Not getting this right is dangerous. \u00a0But that is what the crucible and planning is all about. \u00a0Many ways to go on this, with pros and cons at every turn.\n\n4. Poor systems of conflict mediation: One of the best quotes in that article was, \"\u2018It\u2019s not utopia. It\u2019s microcosm. Everything that\u2019s in the outer world is there \u2013 marginalisation, addiction, poverty, sexual issues, power. Communities are just fractals of society.\u2019 The difference for Sutherland was that in Findhorn there was good will and a clear commitment to waking up: \u2018People are willing to look at their stuff.\u2019\n\n\"People are willing to look at their stuff.\" \u00a0No matter how you say it, get this working and you can go on and on. \u00a0Avoid it, and, well, vaya con dios..bad vibes await you.\n\n5. Factionalism: Inevitable perhaps to some degree, but can and should be diffused with regular\u00a0open and honest talk about it. \u00a0Requires total fidelity to truth, even if the truth is somene admitting that they are conveying an impression and not facts per se. \u00a0The thing is, frank talk should not get put off too long or too often so that bringing up anything turns into some huge blowout deal.\n\n6. Founder problems: leaders and founders don't easily relinquish. \u00a0Every situation is different. \u00a0In a \"does the work/calls the shots\" environment this won't present itself as a huge problem as long as everyone understands and agrees on\u00a0the meaning of the word\u00a0\"work\" and what work has what relative value.\n\n7. Reputation management: can be a problem as an attractor of new people. \u00a0One of the agreements of the operation should be \"don't be an asshole\" plus make sure the plumbing works and the reputation ought to take care of itself.\n\n8. Skills shortage: this has been discussed already in terms of having a variety of people clustered who know how to synergize what they know. \u00a0But if you go out to the country, this will become a big deal right away. \u00a0Unless you want to spend your time learning country skills. \u00a0But in the city the skill sets are going to be more focused on the ER mission as it plays out now, right? \u00a0Grant writing, business management, event planning, workshop managing, etc.\n\n9. Failure to attract new talent or entice subsequent generations: not a near term issue at all. \u00a0But one problem with groups is they can get pretty smug and insular. \u00a0That's not attractive.\n\nNoemi said get a business plan. \u00a0I say yes, at least write down a realistic profit/loss and cash flow sheet. \u00a0One of the best pieces of advice I got when preparing budgets was not to sugar coat the revenue projections but be as dead honest as possible.\n\nAnyway, that's a quick sketch. \u00a0Speaking of skills, I need to go now and look at my son's leaking water heater at a house he just bought nearby. \u00a0I still have a good tookbox.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-01 20:19:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.313802", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1327, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1506, "user_id": 76, "topic_id": 1473, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nFreedom of panorama is the possibility to make photos, videos or paintings of buildings or monuments permanently located on public spaces and to publish it.\n\nIt is a provision in copyright laws, because taking pictures etcetera is seen as a production of derivative works, which usually should be authorized by the owner of the copyright of the \u201cobject\u201d whose your derivative work comes from.\n\nThe freedom of panorama depends on the legislation of the country you\u2019re in: you could find a map of the european countries in which it exists <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Freedom_of_Panorama_in_Europe_NC.svg\">here</a>.\n\nDuring the organization of the italian Wiki Loves Monuments (more informations <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-internet-common-resource/mission_case/wiki-loves-monuments-nutshell\">here</a>) we had to face the fact that italian laws doesn\u2019t allow freedom of panorama -but we found out that there are some interpretations of the laws which allow us to do the contest anyway, don\u2019t worry!- and probably nobody knows that in Italy: me first, I wasn\u2019t aware that I couldn\u2019t freely publish my own pictures of my own country!\n\nI feel quite uncomfortable with this idea: why a good that is freely available to see and enjoy should not be freely available to rapresent? It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t harm nobody, instead could enhance and promote the beautiful things that are in a country -and, as a consequence, the tourism will be encouraged too.\n\nI don\u2019t know how it works in other countries in which there\u2019s not freedom of panorama, but in Italy you need to pay money to the copyright holder or to the State in order to share pictures of monuments who are located on public spaces.\n\nRequesting money in order to fully \u201cuse\u201d something for whose production, mainteinance and conservation someone had or have to pay money makes sense, but asking money to fully benefit of a public good doesn\u2019t.\n\nFirst of all, if an artist make a sculpture or a monument for the State it is already been payed by the State, so it is payed by the citizens, so it\u2019s not fair to ask them to pay for something they have already payed.\n\nSecondly, the costs of mainteinace should be carried or provided by the State: the presence of monuments or relevant buildings is a call for tourism, which should be able to pay with its income the costs of itself. And if tourism goes wrong, probably it\u2019s a State\u2019s fault, not a people-who-make-photos-of-monument\u2019s fault.\n\nSame thing if it\u2019s not a national good but a private good: already payed, and the owner should be able to deal with the costs of maintenaince himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, did you knew about the freedom of panorama issue? Does it exists in your country? And if it doesn\u2019t, how does the law regulate it?

Par exemple, nous utilisons le thermom\u00e8tre pour mesurer la temp\u00e9rature ambiante. Le barom\u00e8tre nous permet de mesurer la pression atmosph\u00e9rique. Le p\u00e8se-personne nous indique les kilos en trop ou en moins.\n\nCependant, il n'existe pas d'instruments pour mesurer les situations et nous donner le pouls dans nos relations avec les autres. Imaginez! Ce serait formidable d'avoir une sorte de montre qui se mettrait \u00e0 s'affoler chaque fois que nous racontons des b\u00eatises ou que nos propos sont blessants, ou encore non appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 un groupe-cible de personnes. Malheureusement, nous ne disposons pas encore de tels capteurs de pens\u00e9es.\n\nIl n'y a pas non plus de programme informatique ou d'application que l'on peut brancher sur la table de conf\u00e9rence, qui capte les \u00e9motions et les pens\u00e9es des gens pr\u00e9sents dans une salle.\n\nC'est difficile \u00e0 expliquer,\u00a0 mais je pense que Giacomo Neri a une sorte de barom\u00e8tre interne. Il ressent les impressions que les autres vivent mais n'osent pas exprimer tout haut. Quand la pression monte et que les cerveaux se mettent \u00e0 surchauffer, Giacomo \u00e9met des signaux qu'il suffit d'essayer d'interpr\u00e9ter, un peu comme on lirait un instrument de mesure, pour tenter de saisir quelle pourrait \u00eatre la perception d'un groupe.\n\nPar exemple, lors de la mini-conf\u00e9rence Edgeryders de mars \u00e0 Strasbourg, Giacomo m'envoyait des gazouillis pour me signifier son inconfort. Je ressentais moi-m\u00eame cet inconfort chez plusieurs personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans la salle, mais lui l'a manifest\u00e9e. D'autres n'ayant pas remarqu\u00e9 ce qui se passait, lui ont demand\u00e9, \u00ab<em>Pourquoi fais-tu cela?</em>\u00bb. C'est ainsi que j'ai pris connaissance de la capacit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de Giacomo, et j'ai imm\u00e9diatement fait le lien avec son exp\u00e9rience des six derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, au cours desquelles il a tent\u00e9 de nous avertir que le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9ducation ne tourne pas rond, qu'il y a quelque chose qui cloche avec ce syst\u00e8me. Giacomo a 24 ans. Depuis des ann\u00e9es, il s'efforce d'envoyer des signaux pour faire comprendre qu'il existe un profond malaise avec le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducationnel.\n\nCette capacit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re pousse Giacomo \u00e0 constamment s'adapter. Il s'appuie sur l'improvisation pour s'ajuster aux situations. Tout comme je l'ai d\u00e9crit pour les trois autres ambassadeurs Edgeryders, Giacomo a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une habilit\u00e9 pour une forme particuli\u00e8re de souplesse, qui pourrait devenir un atout majeur dans son parcours professionnel.\n\nJe per\u00e7ois l'agilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re de Giacomo comme une certaine forme d'intuition. Les dauphins et les baleines entendent et communiquent avec des ultrasons. Je me rends compte que des jeunes, tels que Giacomo, sont en train de d\u00e9velopper de nouvelles habilet\u00e9s, qui pourraient \u00eatre tr\u00e8s utiles en cette p\u00e9riode de transition. Pour arriver \u00e0 faire en sorte que nos syst\u00e8mes et institutions parviennent effectuer une transformation organisationnelle qui soit accord\u00e9e aux plus profondes aspirations de la population, nous avons besoin d'\u00eatre ouverts \u00e0 de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de faire.\n\nJe continue de croire \u00e0 la pertinence que des \u00e9quipes compos\u00e9es de divers types d'iconoclastes pourraient parvenir \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la gestion et \u00e0 solutionner des probl\u00e9matiques. Des jeunes ayant des profils sortant de la normalit\u00e9, un peu comme celui de Giacomo, pourraient servir d'instruments de lecture et de mesure des situations. Qui sait? Cela pourrait \u00eatre pouss\u00e9, d'ici quelques ann\u00e9es, \u00e0 tenter de lire dans la conscience collective?\n\nJ'ai lu derni\u00e8rement qu'il y a des scientifiques qui ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un programme qui permet de lire dans les pens\u00e9es des gens, sans qu'ils ne parlent tout haut. Il y a par cons\u00e9quent d\u00e9j\u00e0 des travaux scientifiques pointant dans cette direction.

Il serait ainsi possible de deviner ce qu\u2019une personne entend ou pense rien qu\u2019en surveillant son activit\u00e9 c\u00e9r\u00e9brale.

Healthcare in Europe has been a forerunner in developing new drugs and medical care to create the healthiest and longest-living society. But it comes at a huge cost. Countries throughout the European Union are looking at new ways of reforming the way healthcare is provided. Is community driven healthcare an option?\n\n<strong>Discover \u201cOpenCare\u201d</strong>\n\nOpenCare, the first online community driven project that addresses the social aspects of healthcare. This project is structured to re-design care services in a more sustainable way, taking advantage of the scattered collective knowledge of individuals and communities, then sharing it to improve the well-being of others. This open-to-all knowledge approach to care is the heartbeat of OpenCare with the intention to explore the conditions for communities to design and deliver their own healthcare services.\n\n<strong>Positive Disruption</strong>\n\nIt\u2019s time for positive disruption in health care, and in care services in general. Why? With the health costs on the rise, the system is under strain, and often, it reacts by denying care to those who need it most. This is morally unacceptable.\u00a0 When the Metropolitan Community Clinic at Helliniko as well as many others, in the world of care has proven how much farther communities can go in taking care of their members when they are enabled to do it. This is a unique health care approach. It is regulated off the grid, run by volunteers, does not accept money and operates with no management. Time to challenge, engage and create alternative solutions.\n\n<strong>Expected Outcomes</strong>\n\nThe OpenCare initiative is expected to help understand how to use the collective intelligence of communities concerning sustainable development and to explore community-driven healthcare. Edgeryders has partnered up with five world-class organisations in research University of Bordeaux, Stockholm School of Economics, ScimPulse Foundation, and City of Milan and WeMake to find, learn from, and enhance the experiences like the clinic in Hellinko all around the world.\n\nTheir goal is a model of community-driven care services, based on modern science, open technology, low overhead and human touch that communities can provide, while large bureaucracies cannot. The OpenCare project, is in support from the European Union through its Collective Awareness Platforms (Horizon 2020).\n\nWe are all touched by healthcare.\n\nCheck out this video that explains OpenCare &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/162811723\">https://vimeo.com/162811723</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Photo credit:\u00a0\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" lang=\"container\" valign=\"top\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n<table cellpadding=\"0\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Bj\u00f6rn Weigelt\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" lang=\"container\" valign=\"top\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-14 09:07:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.682780", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 531, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17527, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1148, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Solid ideas </b>\n\nEimhin I think there is a lot in your \"\u00a0poor netiquette ramble\" that we could explore.

Alas this is not my project or initiative, my housemate and good friend was a participant and I thought it was pretty cool, definitely worth a share.\n\nIts role in cultural blends is an interesting one, everybody involved shares the demographic of a) being interested and capable of making electronic music/ sounds, b) has access to the internet and is a member of ninja forums. Beyond that however these people could be anything. No knowledge of age, gender, ethnicity, technical ability, class etc ect.\u00a0\n\nThe project is a sort of pass the parcel of layers in a track, or tracks in an album. Someone starts and then each successive person edits and adds to the track they are sent, or another format, each person creates a section and blends it into the section they were sent as to create a continuous piece. My friends and I attempted something similar however we knew each other well and could anticipate the directions or styles the others would use, I\u2019m not sure if social hierarchy played a part consciously but where different levels of skill are known, then the subconscious implications on how to edit the track were present. E.g. the best technical ability is equated to the best musical contribution.\n\nSomething wonderful about the anonymity of online collaboration is the possibility of letting go of that (in my opinion) reductive concept of \"quality\" and \"authorship\". Also I think its indicative of the trend I experience as the removal of idolization of the individual and embracing the collective. Everything comes from the collective, whether this is recognized or not has tended us to overlook the power of loose, temporal, and unqualified contributions to all art and thinking. This removal of hierarchy and cultural blending go together. The idea that we (the west, the uk, the educated, etc) are more developed individually because we have been enjoying relative economic and technological hierarchy has been dying for a long while now. Anonymous collaboration and the unjaded power of music compel us to accept cultural blending as firmly established way of making better thinking.\n\nAlso worth a note that this operated outside the institutions of music, is not funded, sponsored or directed in any way at money making, and allows sampling.\n\nhttp://www.theninjaforums.com/\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/35208252- the link to the video and track with description and further links.\n\n<em>\"The game was played between March and August 2011 by members of the Ninja Tune Records online community forum (\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ninjatune.co.uk/forum/\">ninjatune.co.uk/forum/</a>\u00a0).  The idea behind the game was that the first participant would produce four bars of original music, send the finished four bars to a nominated member who would assemble the finished pierce, and then send just their fourth bar to the next player who would then develop their own four bars from that point and repeat the process.

This will help to shape your\u00a0session in a way that will\u00a0contribute to collective insights on this topic.\u00a0\n\nTheme: better understanding policy in context of a top-down system. Even good policies may be limited in their effectiveness - that is by the time they cascade down to the level of effect/impact they are often either diluted or do not produce the effects desired by the original intentions of the policy no matter how well meaning these might be.\u00a0Another way to look at it would be this: living systems theory has turned on its head the Victorian world-view that imagined that unless mankind were imposing order from top down then chaos would ensue. The new sciences - nano biology, quantum theory - have revealed the extent to which order is a natural impulse (fractals\u00a0being a beautify example) and that many of mankind\u2019s efforts to date have disrupted this impulse.\n\nSo what does this say about policy? How do we understand more effective ways to enable our natural impulse as human beings to be caring and compassionate? How do we re-conceive of policies in the light of this - to support and not disrupt the collective impulse to help our fellow human beings?\u00a0\n\nFrom this understanding - how do we understand the instruments and tools of the collective, of citizens - what do they look like in relation to health and social care? Equally, how do we understand the instruments and tools of the state (such as policy) - how can these be designed to enable the collective response that is the basis of welfare in traditional societies?\n\nThe next question would then be how this might inform the nature of the session you\u2019d offer. It seems there's so much you could contribute for joint exploration.\u00a0\n\nThere seems to me to be a common thread in what I\u2019ve encountered of what you\u2019ve sent through. Its something about the format of the various happenings. e.g. Monastery, Galway Soup - that genuinely reflect values of welcome, bringing people in, shifting power, playing with stereotypical roles to create new experiences that have greater meaning - that get under the superficial. Does that make sense? And something about new recipes - the way you put together interesting elements to create new experiences/outcomes. Perhaps you\u2019d want to focus on one of the three thematics? Sharing what\u2019s really worked and using peer review (I\u2019m gathering that this is something ER are particularly keen on) to solve some things that aren\u2019t yet clear/sorted? Which of the three thematics connects most strongly to the health and social care? There\u2019s also the tiny houses &amp; homeless folks work you mentioned. Might this also be a possible session?\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019ve so much good work to choose from - would a way forward be for you to suggest 2-4 possible sessions and we work up the one that has the best connection to the theme?\n\nThanks\u00a0\n\n/gehan\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-23 13:38:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.985816", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 564, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25218, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1194, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Sure!</b>\n\nBring yourselves on :)\n\nSome people will be a bit late, but a few of us\u00a0can start at 9am sharp with\u00a0introduction on Lote and move straight to what Be The Media does and how to get involved, no?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-20 15:00:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.494426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 49, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24525], "is_liked_by": [147], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27641, "user_id": 3402, "topic_id": 704, "post_number": 30, "raw": "No problem!

I find it refreshing: in fact, in the past two years I have been getting rather tired of \"speed dating\" and \"elevator pitches\".

Ready-to-go, affordable health and social care was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unavailable. Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.\n\n<strong>We see people coming together, stepping into the breach</strong>. Communities are taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They are doing amazing things. Hackers make <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/citizen-hackers-concoct-upgrades-for-medical-devices-1411762843\">open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors</a> for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists <a href=\"/t/trauma-tour/707\">set up mobile studios</a> and drive them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients find and help each other <a href=\"/t/losing-hope-gaining-hope/529\">fight back suicidal tendencies</a>. Biologists and biohackers are trying to invent <a href=\"/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519\">a cheap, open source process to make insulin</a>. Activists in America encourage each other to eat healthy food and exercise <a href=\"/t/woodbine-health-autonomy-center/488\">by doing it together</a>.\n\nWe started a research projects to take a good look inside these and many other stories. We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called <a href=\"http://opencare.cc\">OpenCare</a>; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:\n\n<blockquote data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"2kd7\" data-offset-key=\"du3c1-0-0\">\n\n<strong><em>It's all about humans.</em></strong>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nCommunity provision of care services needs humans:  more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills.  Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.\n\nThis intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care. And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. <strong>We will thrive, if we can collaborate</strong>. Collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. Any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. <strong>We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong>\n\n<strong>We dream of a new kind of space</strong>, that can be the hearth for our families but still be open to the broader world. Where the door is not a gate to keep the wolves out, but a bridge to a global network. Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.\n\n<strong>We have dreamt this dream before</strong>. In its previous iteration, we called it the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a>. We prototyped it in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. The most important lesson was this: a life/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learnt how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8f4b0a42f2afab8649f53b79cb0eb632bb59cf31.jpg\" width=\"667\" height=\"375\">\n\n_2014: Lunch in the sun at the unMonastery Matera_\n\nBut the unMonastery also got many things right. <strong>The one I am proudest of is this: we went ahead and tried it</strong>. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.\n\nSo, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. We are trying a second iteration. Right now.\n\n<strong>We are calling it The Reef</strong>. Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).\n\nLike coral reefs, <strong>our new space will draw strength in diversity and symbiosis</strong>. Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events.\n\nAnd like coral reefs, <strong>our new space is going to be an ecology \u2013 a network</strong>. There are many ways to take part in it. Some people will want to live there full time, others will show up once or twice a month, or a year. Some will use it on building projects with us, and with each other. Others will work on shared learning and professional development. Of course, we already have a network: the Edgeryders online community itself. This will not go away, in fact it will become ever more important. But now The Reef will give it a permanent offline presence. Reef members will be the kernel of the Edgeryders community. Everyone is free to join the kernel or not; everyone is free to play the role she feels most at home with.\n\nWe ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work. We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard. @Noemi , @Nadia and I are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.\n\nAre you considering being part of the experiment, or just curious about it? There are three things you can do.\n\n<ol data-offset-key=\"8rjmb-0-0\">\n\n<li>\tWe are planning a side event to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1565289333786291/\">OpenVillage Festival</a> dedicated to The Reef. There, we will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activites therein \u2013 from business to physical fitness and personal development. It is restricted to members, because this is our future home we are talking about. It's up to people with skin in the game to make decisions about it. <a href=\"/t/building-the-reef/6205\">Info here</a>.</li>\n\n<li>\tWe are running our first personal development event in The Reef itself on 26-27 May.

But it has the vibe I was looking for: the excitement of building, and the pleasure of doing it with good, solid people. It is in the sweet spot between ambition and achievability.

Other presentations were more focused on introducing the organisations, presenting their innovation theory/theory of change and their methodology in compact visualisations.\u00a0\n\n<b>What where the reactions?</b>\n\nThis is what the illustrator doing a graphic recording of the talk got out of it:\n\n<strong>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2c28f55a1aa36cb64ba0a2c342db5aca89ab6301.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br></strong>\n\nThese are a few comments and tweets:\n\n<em>\u201cI thought it was really interesting but it was a bit abstract for me\u201d - \u00a0German, female, works on reforming/ restructuring academic institutions</em>\n\n<em>\u201cOf all the presentations these two days I found yours was the most interesting, but don\u2019t you come up against a lot of resistance from medical professionals?\u201d- British, male, works at the Young Foundation\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Very spontanious appearance at \\#govlabP4T, now listening to @edgeryders - thanks @DanielGoliasch for the tip! \\#poc21 @openStateBER</em>\n\n<em>\u201cHow can \\#tech enable collective intelligence &amp; \\#collaboration? @edgeryders \\#govlabP4T \\#opensource \\#socialchange \u201d - @katrin_thinking</em>\n\n<em>\"In Greece there are 68 clinics serving 10% of population without access to health care, 'illegally' on donations\" @Designamyte</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWould you be interested in doing consultig for a large environmentalist NGO?\u201d - Austrian?, Male, consultant</em>\n\n<em>\u201cCan I have your card, I think I have an idea for you...not this year but next one\u201d - German, 40s, demale, on way out of event</em>\n\n<em>\u275dYou only understand dark matter once you engage w/ the system\u2014and learn about administrative hacks.\u275e \u00a0@Martin_Jordan</em>\n\n<strong>Improvements/changes to make ahead of the next presentation:</strong>\n\na) introduction to Edgeryders the vision and history\n\nb) a case study\n\nc) in depth presentation of our unique methodologies and tools and how we practically go about applying them\n\nd) major practical insights\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-17 08:11:45", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 12:07:48.156814", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 589, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5095, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 5062, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2015-12-16 14:13:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.476497", "deleted_at": "2017-09-19 14:52:37.671714", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17332, "user_id": 125, "topic_id": 1532, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Hi Noemi\n\nthis has made me</b>\n\nHi Noemi\n\nthis has made me think a lot, and many thanks for this.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-24 13:03:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.678834", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9848, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4593, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Never heard of this.

V\u00e9lo M\u00b2 (pronounced V\u00e9lo em carree) is a multi modular capsule system fitting on cargo bikes. With our energy platform\u00a0supplied by solar and pedal power you can have the electricity on location to power an open-air cinema, a mobile fablab and much more on top. We bring all these plans to an open source platform and community where anybody can contribute. Cargo Bikes can be used for more than only transport, with V\u00e9lo M2 we give the tools to rethink how we interact, move and use energy.'\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0ed936db5ef17fef2b19983a8649a924a3189b67.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\nSince May 2016 we were funded to do a project called <a href=\"https://canalaccroche.wordpress.com/\">Canal d'Accroche</a> where we use the already designed modules (a cinema module, a mobile fablab and a hookmaking machine) to interact with people in a poor neighborhood and listen to what they need. We see the cargo bike simply as an easy conversation maker, we always have some germed seeds with us that we can put in a flower pot and hang with the hookmaker as a first contact.\u00a0\n\nIn almost two months of weekly activities in the neighborhood we found a neglectec garden that we now opened to public and are going to try to put live in it through other organizations. We also learned that a lot of older men are gathering waiting to be picked up to do small jobs for minimum wage and we are making a coffee module so we can distribute coffee\u00a0and engage easier in conversations. the final purpose is to bring some local kids between 16 and 20 to make with us in a fablab a new module they would want to use.\n\nThis is one way we are designing our cargo bike project but i'm having a lot of trouble building a solid community around or a businessplan that takes care of all our different purposes. At this moment these small grands give us the possibilities to work further on the energy platform and invest in good material. One of our goals is to creat sustainable energy modules that can fix any cargo bike so people would be more found to use them in the city. But because it is a nich we have difficulties to reach out. Another task we gave ourself is to repurpose lost public space through temporary use. Thus\u00a0the cargo bike with our own energy gives us the easiness to go almost anywhere and do that, but behind it there is a difficulty of logistic, having a place where we can put the cargo bike and the modules opened 24/7 close to our working\u00a0station (not open 24/7) is difficult in a city.\n\nwhat i would love to discuss with all you from edgeryders is what do you think about the general project, what could be improved on the communication level and what ideas come to mind when you here about something like that. I thank you in advance!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-19 11:37:28", "updated_at": "2018-06-18 21:11:37.071351", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 603, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 100.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18176, "user_id": 2231, "topic_id": 3170, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks for response </b>\n\nHi Hazem,\u00a0\n\nYes first all there's financial side issue.

When excess of success becomes a problem - you're on to something good! Keep it up!\n\nI would recommend that you find a format that let's you devolve the process a little. Perhaps so that some of the work can be done in a couple of flexible \"satellite events\" on a smaller an more intimate scale. If these are happening for example a week or two days before - then two of the \"core team\" could do some satellite hopping (A-Z and Z-A respectively). That leaves time for the core team to organize ahead of the main event.\n\nDuring the satellite time they would be going around making notes (to answer some difficult questions at the main event), and answer some easier ones on the spot. That way you already get a better overview what kind of crowd you will get at the main event, but you don't throw out a lot of time organizing and confirming. You just do a satellite, and twitter the time and place - and try to cluster them a little in space, but stretch them out over time.\n\nThis would have the benefit for the participants that they can already sleep over some of the initial responses (if you do the satellites before the main event), and it uncramps the event on several levels.\n\nI was happy to hear that the food was good. This is routinely underestimated! If I were to give career advice for getting rich, it would probably be: Remember to put cookies on the table.\n\nA decent blood sugar level does wonders for my mental performance. I found that out while fasting for ten days, while working at a synchrotron (it is expensive, so when you get a block of time - you work day and night). Do yourself a favor and don't try that, unless you want to go <a href=\"/t/brussels-fuckupmoods-lote-5/4491\">there</a>.\n\nLastly, I used to have a folder where I kept useful info on writing in. This however was mostly intended for student theses and research articles published together with students/others. Some of it will still apply/help though, especially if you are more tending to write for Wikipedia or want to translate scientific articles into plain writing. I am unfortunately pretty weak on general journalism or creative writing where the emphasis is quite different sometimes.\n\nI found \"The Craft of Research\" by Booth really good in terms of comprehensiveness. Of course it is pre-networked age (well most of academic science still is) and thus does not cover what <a href=\"/t/draft-new-book-on-networked-collaboration/4516\">we'll try to address</a> as we go along. The EU also has some good resources available as it does loads of writing and translation at a very professional level. But very often you will also need a couple of short cheat sheets that address specific issues that you deal with (or you have to explain) on a regular basis.\n\nIf someone wants my collection you should message me, and we can do this based on \"fair use\". I think actually most of my thing in the collection were freely available from some publisher - even though it may say something else in the document itself still...\n\nBut I'd want you to make an effort an give/point me to some resource that is clearly better than one I use (not too hard to do I think), or is a really worthwhile addition (we're going for quality, not quantity). Ah, yes before I forget: I have to mention Strunk &amp; White before someone knocks it over my head. ;)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-23 09:57:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.701653", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 656, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2554], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11891, "user_id": 1442, "topic_id": 4149, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Done!</b>\n\nI filled the excel with our data and PIC number.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-15 09:19:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.154560", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8461], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15876, "user_id": 51, "topic_id": 2386, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Not sure if it is helpful in this context but..</b>\n\nLess Than $1 A Watt Diy Make Your Own Solar Panel\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/hNH2YGzwznI\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-02 16:18:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:29.107134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 50, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26319, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2235, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Great, spicing up form filling to be the highlight of the day :)</b>\n\n\"<em>The Large FormStorm Collider [...], a scenario\u00a0where\u00a0projects\u00a0collide and merge and new projects might be born.</em>\"\n\nHmm sounds like ... are you into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory#M-theory_and_membranes\">brane theory</a>?.

I am not sure where it would have fit better though.\u00a0 Protecting and Enhancing the Commons [in its multiple manifestations] is the 'promise' I find the most relevant to what I am trying to convey and do...\n\nWe are it seems in a very interesting time where many forces of different nature are converging towards creating a world where each and all of us can thrive. I am very interested in the ways we can find to channel these forces so they can be multiplied and accelerated. In particular I believe that the notion of commons, as the assets that we inherit or that we create and leave for the generations that follow can be a common ground, the 'object(s)' around which we can build our 'oneness', our unity in diversity. Focusing together on preserving, creating, nurturing and replenishing the array of diverse assets material or immaterial that are both at the basis and an outcome of our livelihood can bring some tangibility to a somewhat fragmented activist discourse and could be something that policy makers could put their hands around, in particular as far as engaging civil society is concerned.\n\nI am currently working to establish a map of the various 'trends' or 'movements' or 'socio-semantic elements' that can be related to the commons in order to give some materiality to a multifaceted and fuzzy overarching purpose, to develop relevant narratives and to build bridges between the various parts... I am doing this in collaboration with the School of Commoning in London which has just completed a series of twelve seminars by James Quilligan on the <a href=\"http://www.schoolofcommoning.com/content/what-role-commons-economy\">Emergence of a Commons-based Economy</a>, with conveners such as the NEF, the Finance Innovation Lab, the Civil Society Forum, the Insitutute for Public Policy Research. I attended several of these and noted a strong interest for the commons and a need for clarifying how the commons can be incorporated in a variety of discourses to enhance collaboration, sustainability and value for communities as well as a need to find common grounds for disparate movements to be able to work with each other.\u00a0 I would be glad to develop this work further with the Edgeryder community and to help bring the commons forward in Strasbourg in June.\n\nI would be interested, in relation to this particular mission, if you could share your view of how a specific initiative, trend, or movement can be related to the commons.\n\nFor example, Lynne in a direct message she sent me linked commons to consciousness and evolution: \"Commons, as we're all linked together, we're all responsible for everything. Commons should be at the core of many things, not just the economic model. My interest in consciousness makes me believe that Commons (interpreted as 'Oneness') would allow to align society on the blueprint of evolution, and therefore would bring more balance in this world.\" This is an angle different from that of a shared economy or circular economy, or ecologic preservation, or open data. Many angles, perspectives, points of entry coexist with overlaps and adjacencies, and this is what I would like to capture in a non assimilating and totalizing way.\n\nHere are a couple of articles I wrote relevant to the commons and various transformational initiatives:\n\n<a href=\"http://menemania.typepad.com/helene_finidori/2012/04/the-commons-at-the-core-of-our-next-economic-models.html\">The Commons at the core of our next economic model?</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://menemania.typepad.com/helene_finidori/2012/03/time-to-activate-agency-action-.html\">Time to activate agency and action to bring about a sustainable economy</a>\n\nLooking forward to our conversations,\n\nHelene\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 15:47:45", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 04:41:48.665718", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 650, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 965, "user_id": 522, "topic_id": 932, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Save the date: June 15th!\u00a0</strong> Not one community meetup (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2012/04/the-edgeryders-conference-connecting-the-edges-of-a-new-europe/\">Living on the Edge conference at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg</a>), but a whole bunch of synchronized meetups across Europe, organized by our friends, active Edgeryders and collaborators at\u00a0Kf\u00e9 Innovaci\u00f3n !<strong> </strong>\n\n<em style=\"line-height: 22px;\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/49bfd67cd754171fe0724995416f1e924b036bbb.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\">\n\n</em>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kfeinnovacion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kf\u00e9 Innovaci\u00f3n</a> has been around for a year now, and has gone from individual chats with so-called \u201cexperts\u201d to talk about web 2.0 and innovation with people who may or may not be involved with them, to the current simultaneous, all-around the world face-to-face meetings of 20 people per venue to discuss a subject related to social issues and innovation.

However, I am getting a bit confused, as [Matthias] always told me you need clean data in the back end in order to enable nice things on the front end. In this logic, the conceptually geographic information on \"where are you\" should not be stored as text data! Do you still agree with that? If you do, then the most logical path seems to me to be the following:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>remove the extra text fields you created.</li>\n\n<li>install the modules that add geodata handling capabilities to the platform (I spoke to my favorite Drupal guru in Italy and he recommended: Geofields for data storage, Views + Leaflet for visualization)</li>\n\n<li>re-add the extra fields, this time as geofields</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nBTW, later in September we will be moving to registration phase 2, where people who already registered for \\#LOTE3 tell us if they <em>really</em> will come or not. This would be the chance to get at least the participants to fill those fields.

On day one it was clear there was a huge\u00a0miss-match\u00a0between my own exploratory way of learning and the highly structured learning environment. Actually this was pretty self-evident from secondary school where I spent most of the time trying to escape class to get to the library or go to dance class. What would have worked better would have been pursuing my\u00a0own creative interests, picking up whatever skills and knowledge I needed as\u00a0I went along. It was an expensive too: years of wasted time and tens of thousands in student loans to pay back. It was during the dotcom boom too so money was pretty easy to come buy for wierd startups: double fuckup. The second, ongoing, fuckup is having built a working life which involves far too much screentime. I think the thread here is straight out cowardice and failure to align working life and personal needs/temperament.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-08 10:03:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:57.733821", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 184, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 2945, 3152], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13375, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4514, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>PS: I should read before posting</b>\n\nANYWAY.\n\n(dont mind me)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-09 21:06:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.655017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10929], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19869, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2438, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Opening up the space for candidates</b>\n\nOk so after a chat with [Nadia] yesterday it looks like Moustafa is not our guy.\n\nAs for the other two, there's an idea to invite them online on the platform as part of their recruitment process.

It doesn't yet have very many courses on. I'm pretty busy (aren't we all) so I didn't want to just pick anything and give up time to learning something unfamiliar. I was also loathe to pick a topic I knew something about as it might be a waste of time. In the end, I went for the latter, thinking I would surely learn something new. I went for the topic on Content Curation or being a digital curator. I found the emphasis was a little too much on using aggregators to scoop current news, as if curation was like being a 'flypaper', just catching what was coming up. I made a brief comment about that and instantly got a reply advising me to use a couple of other more academic tools. Both of these were new to me, so that was good. It had the same feeling as Edgeryders, where people immediately respond to your contributions. I had used a few aggregator tools before but there was a really long list provided, and I thought I'd have a go at Scoop.it to curate a topic on Indigenous Learning.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.scoop.it/t/indigenous-learning\">http://www.scoop.it/t/indigenous-learning</a>\u00a0I wanted to gather links on the Sami people, but also about how other indigenous communities are learning and adapting to ecological change. It was very quick to set up and it kept feeding me news that I could discard or publish. However, the links were too news-based so I followed the peer advice and searched for more academic sources. Because I had a Scoop-it plug-in, I could capture any of those sources to my topic board.\u00a0\n\nIt took me around an hour to do the course and the task. I was quicker than I should have been.\u00a0\n\nI could go back and interact with other people some more. I will probably try out a couple of other tools suggested and will see if that leads to any more group learning.\u00a0\n\nIt was a hybrid of synchronous and asynchronous. I was helped out in the task in real time (at midnight) but I could have done it whenever I wanted.\u00a0\n\nI certainly learned a lot about aggregator tools, having seen a very long list that I'd never seen before and tried one new one.\u00a0\n\nCompared to traditional classroom learning, I wasn't held back by a group but helped to progress by a 'more able other'. I didn't have to waste time at all. It was totally efficient.\u00a0\n\nI don't really mind missing out on the face to face social contact for a topic such as digital curation. The topic I was actually researching, Indigenous Learning, is something I would really love to study more in-depth and immersively, by visiting the Sami in Finland etc. I'm not attracted to learning about it in a classroom environment. Either I want to be immersed in the web and seeking help from others out there online, or immersed in a culture and a place. The classroom doesn't really provide either of these immersive possibilities.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 23:45:23", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 04:35:06.737871", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 585, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23284, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1567, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>A bit of everything </b>\n\nI do not know the women in the Di Maio's article.\n\nChristy Clark's video about open government, where she explains what it means to her, is becoming a sort of 'I am a legend' clip.

I do not at all like anything that can be percieved as free-riding or not contributing to the local economy with our presence.\u00a0 Some ideas to explore:\n\nA.<strong> LOTE Food Walk:</strong> Can we pull off with the help of local restaurants and the comitato one evening where people (Materani and visitors) go on a kind of food safari for 30 Euro? We invite a small number of local restaurants to be included on a map where visitors who show them event badges + Tickets can sample a small piece of their speciality and do some small task (ask one another a question (in english and Italian). Then tickets could be sold from any of the participating restaurants so we are not handling money. The map could be included in the little booklet that participants receive on location (I am preparing this) and they get the ticket on giving us the money.\n\nB. <strong>Communal meals at the unMonastery:</strong> Is it realistic to invite local food producers to showcase their food and show us how to cook it as sessions during LOTE? And Make sure we buy the produce from them for the meals at a fair price? One thing we can offer is to do high quality video footage of the session and help promote it on social media after the event.\n\nI think Rocco, Emanuele's dad who took us on a tour of Basilicata, is the right person to help with this. He runs an association that helps local farmers to develop their businesses, knows mind bogglingly alot about everthing to do with agriculture and food and he's really lovely. He;s also very interested in getting involved in LOTE and helping locals connect with the event and Edgeryders community <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a> Andrea Paoletti knows him and can put you in touch if you like?\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Programming the event schedule around food :)</h3>\n\nI am taking general responsibility for putting together the program and ensuring we will make room and give participants insructions so they know what to expect. People are super happy to help, they just need very clear information. I realise this is difficult to do alone, maybe we can write a blogpost and ask people for help with the planning through the comments. This blogpost should be bilingual because food is something we can definitely get people excited about, no <a href=\"/u/nicobis\">@NicoBis</a>?\n\nI propose two bogposts.....\n\n<strong>1. What should we eat? Help with Menu planning &amp; budgeting</strong> for LOTE4!\n\n- We need to figure out a good menu that keeps prices reasonable for event participants, sources food from local farmers, and is fun and easy to cook collaboratively. What do you suggest?\n\n- Menu planning, budgeting, collecting monetary contributions for meals from participants at registration, doing the shopping, preparing the vegetables, boiling/cooking/baking time\n\n- help translate this post to Italian!\n\n<strong>2. Agriculture and Food are very important in Basilicata, at the unMonastery too. How do we make sure the program reflects this</strong>?\n\n- Propose who to involve and how\n\n- Take responsibility for reaching out to them and inviting them to contribute.

From the first glance - their style, way of communicating and strategies are quite different from those who are active in international networking and collaborative online platforms. Local villagers are more used to traditional mentality and ways of solving things. But at the same time the essence of their work, their intentions go in tact with for example \\#unMonastery because they also want to create an independent community with self-sustainable lifestyle that can help everyone living in the community to explore the alternative environmental lifestyle, to prepare for living in a post capitalist reality whenever it happens. <span>They have a few resources at the moment that can be considered as a potential start for an eco-community, including a house they just bought in a wonderful place near Garni, but the main resource is people and they were very happy to see how many of the participants had similar ideas, aims, dreams. All of them have Facebook accounts but only Arsen is connected to Edgeryders so far.

I am by no means an expert, but just from my experience with working on EWB's failure report, I would propose that the cycle is broken at the first step - admitting failure. Our development organizations prioritize the influence of their donors over the needs of the communities they intend to serve. We apply incorrect assumptions to foreign circumstances, unintentionally oversimplify situations, and resort to plans of action that have only failed us in the past. But due to the donor-driven nature of development, it makes more sense financially to hide failures than own up to them. And this doesn't just hold for donors either. As a society, we CARE about reputation and we define success metrics to be extremely outcome-oriented. There is nothing wrong with this, but it does perpetuate the negative connotation of failure. As a result, learnings are not being shared nor internalized, and NGOs are not moving through the learning cycle. This is likely to lead to a bottleneck of repeated mistakes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-22 14:12:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.267698", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 187, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9523], "is_liked_by": [5, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17337, "user_id": 145, "topic_id": 2139, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>End of nov meetup.</b>\n\nI'm also available to meet.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-11 00:37:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.703393", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14735], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19540, "user_id": 209, "topic_id": 4185, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Appreciate the considerations you raise</b>\n\nIndeed, you could say that metamaps is a kind of 'curated' or 'hand-crafted' network graph :)\n\nIn the immediate case of one map, that means it is often relatively personal and contextual. However, the slow accumulation and versioning that can happen when many people from a community or network begin to create and connect their individual maps, frameworks, and perspectives is a very informative and enabling process. So yes, to answer your question there are some (but not many, as of yet) instances of substantial collaboration on individual maps, but what is currently a bit more difficult to see on the surface is that there are many cases where people take inspiration from or make a direct copy of one person's map and then go to work on creating their own version of it, maintaining some connections beneath the surface to those of peers through the use of recurring topics and structures.\n\nOne upcoming feature that we hope will greatly enhance the experience of live collaboration on shared commons maps is the addition of audio, video, and chat communication channels right on the map canvas. Already, if you're on a commons map with another logged in user you'll see their avatar icon moving around in real time and any edits they make.\n\nAnother point to your concern \\#1: something important about the information architecture in a map / graph based system is the \u00a0accessibility of relevant content in a much more context-aware fashion. In the case of more traditional databases, taxonomies, and file structures, content lives in one \"official\" location (say, a project space, to use your example) and is not readily visible to someone working outside that space (a new or different project) unless they know of the existence of the former, or can see a clear relationship between them which has been defined at the system level (say, a hashtag, or higher level category such as \"projects relating to social enterprise incubation\"). In a graph database, you start to see lots of emergent pathways linking content and concepts, which are user defined, and are accessible in various ways to suit the preferences, intentions, or conceptual framework of other users. It takes some getting used to...but 'surfing' a mature collaborative knowledge graph environment is pretty empowering and intuitive!\n\nOne quick note to your question \\#2 is that once the information is there in graph form on any map, it becomes easy to process and package in more presentable or purposeful form. For example, I actually made a 'fork' of that Ops map a while ago exactly for the reason you bring up - something that would be more digestible and relevant to the 'average' guest user. Copied the map, removed some superfluous information, rearranged it, and saved as \"Metamaps Ops Public\" here...\n\nhttp://metamaps.cc/maps/673\n\nWe need to find a better way of showing the sorts of connections happening *between maps* like a Git fork-diff-merge versioning system of some sort...for now, you can at least place one map as a 'topic' onto another map, with the url link in that topic card to jump between. Lots to build, test, and explore! Thanks for taking the time to investigate and share your impressions! This is a fascinating aspect of open collaborative networks and ecosystems right now, and I'm following your work on CAPS with interest.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-09 16:34:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.952659", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 586, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19285], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17885, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5063, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>LOL</b>\n\nWe certainly do\u00a0<img alt=\"laugh\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png\" title=\"laugh\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-17 09:08:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.875190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16280], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9360, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3238, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Proposal: Harmonious Hackathon Visual Profile.</b>\n\nWe are launching on Monday so we need to have the visual profile for the key parts of LOTE ready.

They prefer distruction and threat towards people who are not interested in them to leave but much rather in an interaction and integration.

In these cities, in the last year, groups of <strong>knowledge workers</strong> (visual and performing art workers, researchers, technicians, cultural managers, people who work with cinema, publishing, translation, radio, journalism), but also students and citizens have occupied some theatres and spaces destined to culture.\n\nI lived and visited these places, I interviewed the occupants, I participated to the assemblies.\n\nI anticipated something about this experience in a comment to the mission <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/taking-streets/mission_case/taking-theatres\">Taking the Theatres</a>, but now I want to give a deeper vision of these facts. I collected a lot of materials and so I\u2019ll divide this mission in two parts: in the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/legitimate-illegality-culture-commons-journey-throug-0\">previous mission</a> there is a general description of what is happening and why, in this post there is a deeper analysis about the social and cultural value of these facts and more information about the modality of governance and management of these spaces.\n\nIn Italy the media are talking about these occupations rarely and without giving a true idea of the situation. Instead I think that what is happening is very important!\n\nCulture as commons, precariousness, welfare, cultural policies and wasting of resources are the themes at the base of the occupations of spaces, spaces that can be considered as symbols of contradictions.\n\n<strong>Relations with Institutions</strong>\n\nit is requested to the institutions to share part of their power so that culture as commons can function as devices for the diffusion of participation and of decisional power. This could be also a service to the Institutions so busy that is impossible consider every problem of the citizens and of the city.\n\nit is requested to the institutions to reduce waste (like investments to build new spaces and great events) and promote artistic talents.\n\nThe public administration are alternating between indifference (Catania), attempts at dialogue and attempts to encapsulation (Naple, Rome, Venice). But in this year of occupations in all the cities there were no violent fights with the police.\n\n<strong>What are they doing inside the occupied spaces?</strong>\n\nPublic assemblies alternate with roundtables of inquiry on the conditions of knowledge workers, on culture as a commons, on formulation of proposals for the management of these spaces and on the formulation of the job counter-reform as opposed to the one currently being discussed. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKDIfqiz-JI&amp;feature=share\">here</a> some concrete results about the job counter-reform (it is only in italian, i'm sorry!)\n\nMeanwhile, every day these spaces are clean, open and alive with a varied, continuous, hybrid programmation, accessible to all with the help of all the artists and workers, including some of great fame: workshops, performances of all kinds, Sundays for children, after-school care for children (in Sicilian spaces), the barter markets (Naples), seminars on copyleft and creative commons, a desk to legal support and business planning support (Coppola Theatre), history lessons (Nuovo Cinema Palazzo), readings, projections, trump tournaments in the summer for the elderly (Nuovo Cinema Palazzo).\n\nAt the Teatro Valle are now numerous the residences and the weekly artistic directions with exchanges also between the spaces occupied (the Coppola Theatre will be the artistic director of Teatro Valle for a week).\n\nDancers, actors, lawyers, architects and all other knowledge workers are working together in workshops, on stage, experimenting and even putting the lime in the walls as is especially in the Coppola Theatre.\n\nAll this combined with a social commitment that goes outside the space occupied: from demonstrations, to the campaign \\#savecyclists to the one against the privatization of water.\n\nand then there is what the Coppola Theatre call 'social co-operation' as the \"liberation\" of a playfield for football and rugby made \u200b\u200bby the occupants of the Coppola Theatre and the association Iqbal Masih Librino working for years in one of the worst neighborhoods of Catania with inhabitants and especially children, by providing social services and basing the social inclusion of children especially on sport. it had been asked to the administration to clean up and leave that playground to the association, they also collected signatures on a petition, but to the Public\u00a0 Administration indifference they responded with another \"liberation\" illegal but legitimate.\n\nAll the income from subscriptions or bar as the only sources of funding of these spaces, for activity and works on the structure.\n\nValle Theatre is formulating a statute participated for the first foundation established for the management of a commons\n\n<strong>Participation,</strong> <strong>citizenship and</strong> <strong>neighborhood</strong>\n\nthe participation especially of the inhabitants of the neighborhood is related to the different conditions of the places and also of their neighborhoods: the Nuovo Cinema Palazzo, Marinoni Theatre and Coppola Theatre are located in working class neighborhoods and so the participation of the inhabitants is so strong, also for the reconstruction of the places in worst conditions. Instead a process of gentrification is going on in near Valle Theatre in Rome and in Naples near Ex Asilo Filangieri (now called \u00a0Knowledge and\u00a0 Creativity Asylum), both in perfect structural conditions.\n\nIn Catania a lot of people didn\u2019t know the existence of the Coppola Theatre, but in Catania there is an amazing participation in reconstruction: materials, work from people of the neighborhood. Also from professional plumbers and masons. But at Coppola Theatre now the inhabitants brought also collections of records and a man brought also a gramophone.\n\nI think that bringing personal objects is a symbol of recognition that the theatre is a place of culture, but a place of all the inhabitants.\n\nBut everywhere it is evident the awakening of the district. The first person I met in Nuovo Cinema Palazzo is Adele, a woman of more or less 80 years old who was the conductress of the Cinema and is one of the occupant; often on Sunday in the Valle Theatre arrived pies baked by neighbors who also participate to the occupation doing cleaning or host committees or also every week-end there are guided tours of the theatre and a lot of Roman citizens entered in the theatre for the first time in their life during the occupation; the Sunday for children in Knowledge and Creativity Asylum (Naples) or in Nuovo Cinema Palazzo with clown are always crowded (children in occupied spaces!!!)\n\n<strong>Social and cultural value of \u201cillegal\u201d spaces</strong>\n\nI asked the occupants as you might quantify the social and cultural value that they are producing. They haven't even found a way that would make quantitatively the value produced, but everyone agrees that finding a way to quantify it can be useful to legitimize their illegal actions and it will probably make it even easier to request the negotiation of a new labor law and a new welfare system.\n\nThe social and cultural value is produced because these spaces have become places of artistic and sociological research and experimentation, places where we take care of his own cities and citizens, places where you implement new social policies based on co - operation and identification of real urgencies.\n\nIn these spaces the artists and workers of different disciplines are experimenting new collaborations, as well as in the New Palace Cinema there is a permanent laboratory of juggling and clowning, a discipline that has no place in academia.\n\nhow to quantify the value produced by experimentation? With what has been cut off funding for culture?\n\nHow do you quantify the actions of social cooperation? What is the value of a clean playground for children of Catania? how to quantify the effects of the new sociality that is created?\n\nThere are people of all ages that somehow make their own space and live together.\n\nHow do you quantify the restoration and the maintenance of the spaces?\n\nThe Coppola Theatre is quantifying how much you would spend hiring construction companies to do what the occupants did and comparing with the costs actually incurred.\n\nHow do you quantify the value of the knowledge produced about the formulation of new legislative and management tools? How to quantify the legal counseling and the business planning support? with the fees that would ask the consultant?\n\nWhat is illegitimate in the face of indiscriminate cuts, neglect, indifference?\n\n<strong>Final cuts and a new vocabulary</strong>\n\nat the end of this journey I have a little new activist vocabulary in which \"occupy\" means \"taking care\" and \"commons\" are places for construction of other economies and pure forms of cooperation and sociality, other forms of government, new forms of social enterprises.\n\nI think it's obvious how to deal with the degradation in the cities, the restrictive ordinances give poor results compared to open a space for culture, of everybody, completely multifunctional.\n\nBut we must understand how to keep alive and active in the long term these activities and these spaces to avoid the risk of self-exploitation\n\nI don't know if the new type of foundation that the Valle Theater is founding, with the popular shareholding to support the foundation, can be a solution.\n\nEach group has a strong identity related to his own territory so I guess it's hard to find a single solution for all the same, but you should still focus on the strength of the network that is increasingly widening, thanks to the incorporation of workers with different skills and thanks to the liberation of spaces in different cities almost as if there was a viral infection.\n\n(Ah, the infection will explode tomorrow in Milan. It is a scoop for Edgeryders!)\n\nI know there are other theaters in Europe, in Greece and the Balkans in particular, who are carrying out similar experiences. I'd like to know more about them. So I invite other Edgeryders involved or informed on these events to share their experiences\n\nthank you for reading.

I thought it strange that a person was unchallenged by the people in the room except for myself, and started to ask questions :) I used to be in the advertising business and got fed up, quitting my job without giving much thought to what I would do next \u2013 all I knew was that it really wasn't for me, all this work and energy and cognitive power going into maintaining the illusion of the \"new\". It was an environment in which you as a young person could get space quite quickly and so it made sense to give it a try for a while, but in the end I grew bored of the whole thing and wanted to be working on real challenges- addressing complex wicked problems. Plus, there was an ethical dilemma; it's hard to be honest with clients when the livelihood of your colleagues depends on your not alienating them. And it's increasingly important to my sense of integrity to be able to work against the developments that harm my, 0ur, future. Kind of like not voting against your best interests in an election. I was doing freelance User Experience Design when the opportunity to work with the Council of Europe popped up- and saw all of my current interests, skills and networks converge into doing something I really believe in.\n\n<em>N: What is it that you like best in your work?</em>\n\nI think it's having my belief that there is a community out there waiting to happen, that involving citizens in policy deliberation does work and interacting with all of these inspiring people from all over the world who have real solutions to big issues. Also it's forcing me to re-assess long held beliefs and preconceived ideas, which is healthy.\n\n<em>N: What is your favourite transition story posted so far on <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/completed-missions\">Edgeryders</a> platform?</em>\n\nOh no I knew you'd ask this! mmm <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/frustrated-educational-system-designing-service-end-it\">this one</a> that just came in really resonates with me; I remember just kind of surfing through school and my University education feeling like the whole exercise was pointless...there was little discussion about the aim or point of most of it. And that's just the one that's top of my mind because I just read it a few minutes ago.\n\n<em>N: Finally, can you tell us how do you see this project unfolding? what merits for the participants?</em>\n\nI think in Edgeryders we are experimenting with a new way in which institutions can learn from and in collaboration with citizens. Collaboration is hard, even amongst people who work and move in the same contexts, have shared languages etc. We're doing this online with individuals from over 47 different countries and very different walks of life.\u00a0 Above and beyond the actual policy recommendations that will be presented to European policy-makers as results of the wisdom and experience coming out of the community, I think that if the project is successful, everyone who has participated will come away with a bigger network of people they can continue to collaborate with or turn to for help with their own future trajectories. I've been invited to do a presentation about How Governments Learn on January 25 in London. It's a good opportunity to learn more about the project itself and meetup with some Edgeryders. Do join us if you're around I think it will be fun and a good opportunity to learn new things and meet new people- the more diverse the range of participants the better the discussion.\n\nPresentation Title:\u00a0 <strong>How Do Governments Learn to Do New Things?</strong>\n\nWhen: Wednesday <strong>January 25</strong>, 2012 <strong>1:30pm - 2:15pm</strong>\n\nWhere:\u00a0 <a href=\"http://lwf12.sched.org/venue/Salon+Bourdieu+%28S2%29\">Salon Bourdieu (S2)</a> <em><a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=LWF+Festival+Area%2C+National+Hall+Gallery%2C+Olympia&amp;z=13&amp;layer=t\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"View on Google Maps\">LWF Festival Area, National Hall Gallery, Olympia</a></em>\n\nTo register please email me: <strong>\u00a0nadia.el-imam [at] coe.int </strong>\n\nHere's the link to the session: <a href=\"http://lwf12.sched.org/event/e8a3708ba73031ebb86aa99002e38fdd\">http://lwf12.sched.org/speaker/nadia_elimam</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-19 06:00:54", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:20:03.063060", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 933, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14821, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1421, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>What exactly is the blueprint of evolution? Let's align!</b>\n\nAndres, this is really interesting. Wow, I'm excited. I see that you have an intuitive awareness that there is a global intelligence.\n\nOh YES, there is!\n\nThis is my current understanding (<span><span>and</span> <span>that of many</span> <span>wise men). </span></span>\n\nThe blueprint of evolution is indelibly stamped on the brain, we need only know how to read it in order to design our institutions and lifestyles to conform to the demands of evolution. A global intelligence exists, and it is empowering human evolution. When scholars and scientists begin to consider the possibility that the human race is evolving, and that evolution is progressing toward a specific goal, they will overwhelm the media with their new insights and conjectures. The light at the end of the tunnel will then flood their institutes and laboratories, and this will have a deep impact on our lifestyles, governments will be invited by citizens to align their policies along these lines.\n\nTherefore, what we need to do, <span><span>if</span> <span>we want to grow </span><span>harmoniously</span><span>, </span></span>is ALIGN WITH IT, align with the global intelligence, align with this force.\n\n<span><span>It is imperative that</span> <span>humanity</span> <span>crosses the</span> barrier <span>where it</span> <span>aligns on</span> its <span>psychic and mental</span> <span>forces</span>.</span>\n\nI see it a lot at Edgeryders, it stands out in front of the eyes, if you read between the lines, you will feel that new values are being carried and highlighted by the participants. Why is that? Because these participants listen to the little voice inside them, the one voice that whispers them what is good for their lives. Many participants say that they follow their dreams (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/creation-kyopol-system-aka-symbiotic-city-internet-catalyst-civic-engag\">Pedro Prieto-Martin's story</a>); or one day, they suddently started crying and realized that their old lifestyle was not for them anymore (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/interview-sharer\">Neal Gorenflo's story</a>); or they changed their paths (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/my-story\">Bridget McKenzie's story</a>); or they scratch their heads to find solutions to end war conflicts, they have a plan (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-social-innovation/mission_case/ive-got-plan\">Tiago Dias Miranda's story</a>); or they adopted new ways, etc. It is all over the place, consistent in almost all the mission reports. Hey! Even an economist is talking about <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/reality-check/mission_case/storytelling-divination-forgiveness-my-most-important-tools-and-where-i-p\">'</a><span><span><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/reality-check/mission_case/storytelling-divination-forgiveness-my-most-important-tools-and-where-i-p\">forgiveness' and 'divination'</a> (ref <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/alberto\">Alberto Cottica</a>). My jaw almost fall off when I read his stories. </span></span><span><span>It gives me</span> <span>chills</span> <span>on the forearms</span><span>,</span> <span>and</span> <span>not</span> <span>you</span><span>?</span></span>\n\nSomething is definitely happening! The testimonies are there to prove it.\n\nHowever, there are people who reached an even higher level, they crossed higher barriers of the mind, where <span><span>few men</span> have <span>marched</span><span> before. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>I recently joined the <a href=\"http://www.icrcanada.org/\">Institute for Consciousness Research</a>, because I know that there is a global intelligence empowering evolution. I feel it in my whole body mind and soul. I know that research has to be undertaken, and that the first step is laying a foundation based on documentary evidence of information gathering (just like Edgeryders is doing here). </span></span>\n\nLooking forward to meet you in person Andres! Good intuition work! Please keep thinking! I'll be glad to have more chats with you.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-12 15:46:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.519037", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 804, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23314, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4443, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>You could be onto something here</b>\n\nHmm. I had not thought of it that way. Let me add:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We have been trying to reform the notification system for some time. There was a hackathon on it at LOTE4, and it <a href=\"/t/project-ark-saving-edgeryders-from-the-email-notification-deluge-making-a-newsletter-digest/3831\">made some headway</a>, and then it got stuck. It seems trickier than expected.</li>\n\n<li>During the hackathon, it emerged that the trade off is between giving \"not enough\" notifications to newcomers and \"too many\" to experienced users.</li>\n\n<li>Sam was the first to explicitly address the issue of posts with very many comments</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nMaybe the idea of \"spam on demand\" might be a workaround in the short term. But we absolutely need to find a better system in the longer term.\n\nAs for opening the main thread... we could do that. In general, everything should be open by default. But when trolling takes a foothold, there is a real risk of ending up prioritising the right to troll rather than the right <em>not </em>to be trolled. Difficult call \u2013 and we are not the first to have to make it. I am not convinced which is the best way to proceed, at all.\n\nI definitely think, with so many platforms, if Edgeryders has anything unique to offer is some possibility for action. And that possibility seems to work for some people: just watch the enthusiasm of the <a href=\"/t/future-makers-nepal/598\">Nepalese</a>, the <a href=\"/en/spot-the-future-bucharest\">Romanians</a>, or the <a href=\"/t/project-ark-saving-edgeryders-from-the-email-notification-deluge-making-a-newsletter-digest/3831\">Egyptians</a>. I mean, Ben, no disrespect but if you re-read your latest contributions they are <em>overwhelmingly negative. </em>You use titles like \"Weird and uncomfortable\", \"How Edgeryders has changed\", or \"Completely unacceptable\"; they use titles like\u00a0<a href=\"/t/tired-of-hearing-that-we-can-t/4437\">Tired of hearing that we can't</a>, <a href=\"/t/nice-to-meet-you-edgeryders/4434\">Nice to meet you, EdgeRyders!</a>, <a href=\"/t/mapping-the-grassroots-that-not-many-believe-we-have/4407\">Mapping the grassroots that not many believe we have</a> and <a href=\"/t/breaking-barriers-organizing-together/4409\">Breaking barriers, organizing together</a>. Well, you have your opinion, they have theirs, fair enough. But are you sure you want to spend your time lecturing people you obviously find disagreeable? Are you sure you want me to help create an environment conducive to this kind of interaction? And why? You have created, what? Seven online spaces for the unMonastery? Eight? Plenty of space there to create (quoting Arthur) \"your new Jerusalem\", the perfect, hospitable, serene space for collaboration. You can succeed, where Edgeryders has failed. Why waste time here?\n\nVinay once told me: the main principle of open source is \"if you don't like our project, you do not fight for control of it: you fork it and make your own\". There is a lot of wisdom in this. Everyone wins: in the end you have two projects instead of one, people can choose the one they feel closer to.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 14:47:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.484841", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 574, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23122], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31931, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4914, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\n:-)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-29 09:21:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.523028", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22445, "user_id": 2214, "topic_id": 3150, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Schitzolinguists</b>\n\nThanks N for pointing this out.\n\nI think there is some truth to this argument that we have different personalities when we speak different languages to a varying degree. But I don't believe it is because of inherent structural differences within languages. It is to do with cultural context and how we want to be understood as we say the same things in different contexts.\n\nAn example - when I first went to Russia, one day I was standing and waiting in the metro for a ticket (or plastic token as it was then). When I got to the window, I started out like a true Englishmen in my relatively unaccented Russian: \"Excuse me, I'd like to buy a ticket for the metro please. Could you tell me how much it is please?\"\n\nThe cashier gave me a death stare. \"What?\" I repeated myself. The cashier sighed loudly. People in the rush hour queue behind me started to complain. Finally I got my \u017eetony after a couple of minutes. I felt very stupid - I'd obviously done something wrong so I waited behind to watch how the other customers behaved. After a while I understood: not a single word was exchanged in the transaction. The customer put money down, the cashier gave them a token. There was only one thing for sale. There was literally nothing to talk about.\n\nThe next time I behaved like an impeccable Russian - silently.\n\nWhat would the researchers have said about this if it featured in their research? That in Russian I was ruder? Not according to the Russians who did that every day. I was happy because I was communicating more effectively. The cashier was happy because she understood me more clearly.\n\nRudeness or otherwise was literally beside the point.\n\nLanguage is just a tool for communication. Context is everything. And fear plays a big part. I'm a big fan of the concept of the idiolect - the unique web of linguistic ideas that we carry round in our heads, the snowball that rolls through our lives gathering linguistic debris as we go downhill through each day.\n\nIt's not language itself that causes us to appear differently. It is our desire to communicate most effectively in a particular context, using the words and ideas that we have experienced most often in that linguistic context. The last para is the key one: 'Whether that\u2019s due to the different context in which she learned French and Portuguese, an inherent difference between the two languages, or some combination, researchers have yet to figure out.'\n\nFor me this latter idea seems to have been quite widely disproved. For further reading I recommend Through The Language Glass by Guy Deutscher.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-18 13:00:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.920313", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 30.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21602], "is_liked_by": [4, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22306, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5866, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Reading!</b>\n\nReading your blog post now.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-23 09:41:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.223753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21240], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22685, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 3469, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>works for me</b>\n\nlooking forward to seeing you all there!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-10 11:39:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.170185", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22257], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4576, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4543, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"font-size: 1.4em;

We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future. LOTE4 aims to set the foundations for a global Stewardship ecosystem encouraging free flow of information, knowledge and actors between different contexts, sectors and leadership roles.</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Introduction</h2>\n\nOver the centuries, nation states all over Europe have developed or acquired control of assets of all kinds. The overarching logic behind this development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate.\n\nIn an effort to correct this situation, some public assets have been turned over to the private sector. This move has had mixed results: while some financial advantages states has indeed materialized, at least in the short term, many privatization programmes suffer unintended consequences. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself.\n\nThe Edgeryders community has accumulated significant experience in this area. Many of us have been experimenting with ways to communally manage diverse assets including: spaces like the unMonastery, digital mesh networks, libraries, geographic databases or software projects as public or common goods, oriented towards the community\u2019s well being. There is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship.\n\nWe believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Why explore this concept? Four arguments</h3>\n\nPlease help refine the points.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Alternative responses to dysfunctional labour market and lowered demand for goods and services/consumption. Can asset transfer to communities add new tropic levels in the economy? How community owned enterprises contribute to positive impact to resident\u2019s ability to make a living and or meaning/new social roles? What economic models are viable based on locus of control (e.g medical records) require individual retaining control due to risk of abuse. Jarod Lanier</li>\n\n<li>Cutting costs of provision of public services,while retaining or increasing control/ influence of citizens over their living conditions and environments. Alternative to privatisation?</li>\n\n<li>Efficient and responsible management of finite resources in response to social-ecological crises.\u00a0 Does mutualised risk and ownership foster more responsible use of public services? Can community stewardship offer a third alternative?</li>\n\n<li>Everywhere we care to look, individuals and groups are innovating in response to the trio of systemic crises threatening our futures. In part this is in response to the state\u2019s failure to generate credible responses to problems facing the citizenry characterised by a\u00a0 lack of moral resonsibility and sense of power to act on things. What if what we are seeing are signs of our societies moving into a long evolutionary phase without coherence between state attempts and those of bottom up or civil society to address social challenges?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Growing antagonism in the relationships between organised communities, commercial actors and states. Need for aligning work and help to support each other innovate away from destructive behaviours and business models.</li>\n\n<li>Another risk is that of complementarity giving way to substiution: How, then, do we handle states\u2019 attempts to push civil society and organisations such as foundations as to take over their responsibilities?

As part of that process we aim to bring together a strong combination of projects in stage of development, international networks and influential stakeholders to advance the opportunities and collaboration between a new era of community stewardship. Fundamentally we\u2019re focused on the long term support and growth of existing initiatives, as part of that drive we will work together to ensure a set of outcomes as follows:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Develop a clear and concise report that outlines what\u2019s at stake in the transfer of assets to communities and how different stakeholders can contribute towards positive outcomes.</li>\n\n<li>Establish a global stewardship ecosystem encouraging free flow of information, knowledge and actors between different contexts, sectors and leadership roles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Build and generate a critical mass of attention around key projects that emerge from the event.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Secure sustained support for project development of initiatives selected for the Stewardship awards (idea: companies support prize winners with time of in house staff members).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nKey questions for participants:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How do projects working at the Edge prove and make legible their value?</li>\n\n<li>What qualities and skills make for a credible \u2018Steward\u2019?</li>\n\n<li>What are the risks involved in the transfer of assets?</li>\n\n<li>How do projects with long term objectives achieve support in the short term?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section rtecenter\"><strong>Preliminary program (your feedback is much appreciated!)</strong></h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Day 1: Scanning the horizon</h2>\n\n<em>//In order to open LOTE4 on the right footing, it\u2019s important that everyone gets an understanding for where we\u2019re coming from, what our shared objectives might be and what\u2019s at stake.

Like all LOTEs there will be no space for spectators.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Curators</strong>: Are responsible for shaping the tracks, identifying where the highest energy and drive is in the theme and bringing those individuals together in a cohesive thread.

Rather than everyone turning up in the same place and seeing what emerges - the Harmonious Hackathon starts months before with projects posted on the EdgeRyders platform, each project will set out clearly an overview, objectives and requirements for what is to be done on the day. And is followed up with work from the Edgeryders team\n\nDuring the lead up to the event, and in the physical sessions, the community will swarm the project to troubleshoot, refine the objectives and invite others to join the hack. We will also try to get companies to donate paid staff time pro bono to help individual projects with hands on project development work (coding, design, communications, fundraising etc). During day 3 of the \\#LOTE4- The Stewardship, 3 to 8 projects are worked on in parallel.\n\nIt is an opportunity to look up and do kind of open thinking with others that is very generative. It results in building interest and mass around existing and new initiatives or ideas. It also ensures work gets done on things that would improve existing projects and programming, but require collaborative effort outside day to day operations.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-05 16:43:12", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:17.967776", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2992, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19887, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6433, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Sorry I missed it</b>\n\nConnectivity problems between the desert and the sea ....\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-06 19:07:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.732808", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11999, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1208, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Quick first answer for now ...</b>\n\nThanks for your insightful comments, Ilaria \u2013 much appreciated! You're obviously right that there has to be a process. The idea of handing out phones got abandoned long ago when it became clear that, at first, this will not be a mobile app but a website. (The name is still from these old days ...). We're still sorting out what kind of community deployment process would fit (and obviously it can't be decided without knowing Matera first-hand). However, I'll publish a similar list of the ideas we had so far, and you can then relate it to Southern Italy.

However, I need to know a bit more about what you mean by \"immaterial\" exchange for culture, creativity, tourism? Of course, you can trade not just products in Economy App but anything of value: small atomic tasks like translation (big thing in the software, like for \"working a bit on interesting tasks to relax\"); or offering services, like brainstorming, touristic services etc.. Or do you rather mean if one can reward people for intangible properties like \"being a local business\" where it's hard to put a price tag on?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-04 00:36:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.698083", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 527, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6888], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12002, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3614, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>thanks for heads up, fixed!</b>\n\nWhat do you think about the content btw?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-16 12:00:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.714206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10086], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11451, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3883, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>?</b>\n\nHey Katalin,\n\nNot sure how you arrived at the conclusion.In our conversation last night I was not talking about unMonastery but about Edgeryders as a community. unMonastery is an important shared community initiative but I think you can only draw definitive conclusions about unMonastery Matera from unMonastery Matera.\n\nIn Edgeryders we only speak for ourselves (i.e. self-represent) so I do not think that you can draw conclusions about what other people's goals for any project or activity are based on what any individual says- they are as diverse as is this community. The beauty of this diversity and a permissive culture is that you do not have to agree on everything to be able to act in whatever ways you feel are relevant and necessary for your own objectives.\n\nunMonastery Matera operated under constraints set by the arrangement under which the building and grants were made available. In that arrangement unMonastery was accountable to the city and its citizens. And in several cases it did succeed in meeting those goals, with clearly successful outcomes for the residents of Matera and for the people who drove those initiatives.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mxd9SlmWrqM\n\n\u00a0\n\nCoderdojo, Picanello, Kiderwind, Mimi's Hydroponic garden monitoring system, LOTE4 public sessions in Italian (200 local residents came and stayed for over 2 hrs), Petroleum Management in Basilicata (the fact that a serious, constructive conversation was had on a really infected topic was quite an achievement), talent attraction to Matera etc. These are concrete, tangible outcomes (as percieved by some of the city's inhabitants and the local administration).\n\nAlso on a professional development level my observation is that some people have developed new interests\u00a0 and skillsets.\n\nLet's take documentation as an example.\n\nAfter \\#lote4 I noticed a shift where we all talk about great documentation and the need for it as a given. I recall a lot of resistance to documentation of the ongoing projects of some residents in the unMonastery prototype. Documentation is important because of accountability. But it is also powerful in helping you stand your ground if and when you or your projects come under attack by loud critical voices, especially when they are wrong. Because there is a trail showing what you have been doing, why and progress- it makes your work legible to others even if they only experience a snippet and you give those who like your work the means to defend it with you. The Pisolino Libero initiative is a perfect example. The data is available: 20k likes, international coverage, private cafe owners offering space to do it inside their property. It was however not aggregated in one place prior to the email from one person in the local administration. Had it been then others in the local administration would have had no problem telling them to back off because... evidence says the project is contributing towards achieving the goals of the candidacy, whether or not one person freaks out. Or even the whole administration.\n\nThe other thing documentation does is gives you freedom because anyone with experience of doing anything complex knows that plans and priorities change. You may discover that the initial project or question doesnt make sense or is never going to work. Maybe you see something much more immediately relevant and actionable and want to do that instead. With continuous documentation you can follow this development and it makes it easier to tell the story of what is happening and defend the process. I do not believe you will ever get away from the expectation of tangible/presentable outcomes/results- no matter if it is a gallerist, funder or client or the taxpayer, whoever is bankrolling the work you are doing. But I do believe this gives you maneuvering space.\n\nEach instance of any project will have its <em>own</em> constraints under which it operates and those will be tied to the deals you negotiate in the early phases of setting up anything really. What happens in other iterations will be determined by different sets of constraints. Which is why I believe it is important to to learn the practical details and skills for creating new conditions, physical, economic etc for doing anything. Only when you have that in place do you know what parameters you are operating under and how to navigate/hack them to achieve your objectives.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-07 09:19:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.056104", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 772, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8698], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12890, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Yes, but we need a group!</b>\n\n[K], the way to do that technically is the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>you <a href=\"/node/add/group\">create</a> a group for the \"human team\" (you might want to think of a better name.

I obviously don\u2019t like staying in one place very often. In those 13 postgraduate years I have lived in five different countries with only 5 of those years back in the UK. I also obviously don\u2019t like living in my country of origin very much. I hardly feel to belong to my hometown any more, never mind \u2018my\u2019 country. Even though I have very little doubt both shape my identities considerably I don\u2019t consciously accept any relationship between who I am and where I am from. The only irritating exception to this is my support for national teams in sport. Despite my desperation not to identify on a national level because it contradicts my universal human beliefs, I cannot shake this emotional response to sporting pride. My beliefs are played out though when I try to adapt to everywhere I go as much as possible. I wouldn\u2019t say I have any desire to \u2018go native\u2019, that would just reinforce the nationalisation of identity I am so against. Instead this \u2018adapting\u2019 is more a desire to belong in different groups.\n\nI think adapting is a natural process\u2026 unless there exist ghettos which enable you not to adapt. (I try to avoid these though \u2013 as much as I liked many of my classmates at uni, when they all hung out together almost permanently in Toulouse during a two-month study programme, I hung out elsewhere and with other people.) I studied in Scotland and gained a Scottish lilt to my accent in the process. It was in Glasgow though, so some might say it was a survival technique for a weedy Englishman. I think the really interesting thing is though, that you adapt within your familiar surroundings too. An in-group aversion built inside me means I have several very different groups of friends in the same place (and \u2018former\u2019 places), with a group behaviour style to fit in with each of them: perhaps I\u2019m an itinerant chameleon. This shiftiness of character needs acceptance by the groups as well. In some of my experiences the group identity was so strong it excluded temporary group members. At the same time the group identity can be very superficial because it is too open and spontaneous. I\u2019ve lived in both Madrid and Barcelona and in my experience they were at either extreme of this group identifying process. I was really privileged to be incorporated into a tight-knit group in Barcelona where it felt like the group bonds would last for life, but I also felt great joy of belonging in a 6-hour lasting party group spontaneously gathered in the streets of Madrid one night. I don\u2019t think I can make a call on the rights and wrongs of either \u2013 it\u2019s just the way it is. It might be very easy for the itinerant, however, to take away conclusions that judge one or other society well or badly, and that\u2019s where I think the mistake would be made. I think I get on well in nearly all new situations I find myself in because I accept them as they are and try to make the most of them for myself by adapting my own behaviour. \u00a0At least I think I do, perhaps I should ask the group members whose space I\u2019ve invaded!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-08 16:13:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 09:51:59.334334", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 606, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 56.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 942, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 909, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Last week I participated in the\u00a0 Learning without Frontiers festival and conference in London. Now in its 9th edition the annual event aims to bring together international thought leaders, policy-makers and innovators from different sectors to discuss how society is changing and how approaches and platforms for learning reflect, embrace and respond to those changes. We are just about to start reaching out to partners interested in exploring what goes on at the edges of Learning\u00a0 with us, and so the invitation to present couldn't have come at a better time- a big thanks to the organisers. At the \\#LWF12 presentations I attended, much emphasis was placed on initiatives, approaches and technologies that contribute towards fostering creativity and innovativeness in children or adolescents. The\u00a0 presenters and organizations present offered a variety of views on how this is best achieved. Jacob Kragh of Lego Education talked about\u00a0 learning as being social in nature, highlighting the importance of learners reflecting on the learning they are doing; that thinking about meta-cognition and the \"thrill, skill and will\" of learning is not only relevant for a privileged few.\n\n<blockquote>\"what I've learned in my life I've learned through realizing my own projects, my own vision\" Ray Kurzweil, \\#Lwf12</blockquote>\n\nJakob also described their take on having students learn by addressing real challenges that they could see the results of their work and develop creative leadership in the process.\u00a0 Geoff Mulgan, Ceo of Nesta, also emphasized the importance of re-integrating work and learning in efforts aimed at promoting change for creativity and innovativeness; \"learning for real\" is a strong motivator. Geoff also pointed out that while innovation starts with observation, education often seems to start with imposing an idea on students. Another important ingredient in innovation is assembly of hybrids and putting things together in new ways; remix culture is a vital part of ecosystems that encourage and support creativity and innovation.\n\n<blockquote>\u00a0\" It does not matter what we throw at education, unless we agree on what the point of education is. What is purpose of education in the world? It must be survival of our species.\u00a0 To challenge superstructures... confronting some of the elephants dancing in the room when we talk about education\". Graham Brown-Martin, Founder of Learning Without Frontiers.</blockquote>\n\nNoam Chomsky was asked what he saw as being the point of education as well as whether education is a cost or investment. I agree with his reservations about the questions as they imply that 1) learning is synonymous with Education 2) that learning is something that adults or society at large gives to , or invests in, the young and not the other way around 3) that innovative contributions to society made by people who do pursue creative enquiry are recognised and acknowledged even if they fall outside the mainstream, are hard to define or propose solutions to challenges not yet recognised as being important.\n\n<blockquote>\"Value directive conceptual apparatus; know what you are looking for and cultivate the capacity to seek the right things.\" Noam Chomsky, \\#Lwf12 \"Look at what young people have already done in the world\" Ray Kurzweil, \\#Lwf12</blockquote>\n\nI was invited to do a presentation on how governments learn to do new things. In the presentation I described two theoretical models of how governments learn and some of their short-comings. I also described a new approach that seems promising as it both has support in recent developments in the literature and is based on a realistic understanding of the everyday reality of the people tasked with policy-making and execution.\u00a0 We are piloting it in the Council of Europe and the European Union through a massively collaborative online project called Edgeryders which casts young (and not so young) people as solution finders and protagonists, not beneficiaries or recipients, of policies designed to enable the futures they are building. <strong>If you'd like to participate</strong> in Edgeryders just go ahead and <strong><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/group/welcome-group\" target=\"_blank\">join the community</a></strong> , everyone is welcome. <strong>If you are an organisation</strong> interested in collaborating with us read\u00a0 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1iPCT_PbGLqOsgapYntIjrknqan3C_5QSLCha9j59dvw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Download Edgeryders Project description (2 pages) via this link\">this executive summary</a> for an overview.

I am making my comments being based on issues raised broadly in public domain and which needs to be addressed if we are seeking more than Band-Aid approach in Nepal in relation to post disaster reconstruction.</span>\n\n<strong>#Question of Transparency/Accountability:</strong>\n\nThe government of Nepal does not have credible history of accountability, the question relating to accountability of government in fund mobilization has often been in question. During the post-quake phase, the accountability of government in terms fundraising and mobilization has be subjected to severe skepticism from world community.\n\nIn the current context not only government but transparency of financial aspect of NGOs and INGOs has been issue of discussion. Please refer to: <a href=\"http://myrepublica.com/t20/item/22748-commentary-ingos-show-us-your-numbers.html\">http://myrepublica.com/t20/item/22748-commentary-ingos-show-us-your-numbers.html</a>\n\nWe have also witnessed claims and counter claims from CSOs and the government relating to post quake relief activities. CSOs have also alleged government of not cooperating and even playing obstructive role in post-earthquake relief activities. Please refer to:\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/earthquake-relief-nepal-could-be-better-if-civil-society-s-hands-weren-t-tied\">http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/earthquake-relief-nepal-could-be-better-if-civil-society-s-hands-weren-t-tied</a>\n\n<em>The broader concerns of reconstruction, Communitarian Approach and other opportunities can only be materialized being based on principle of accountability and transparency. Accountability and transparency of stakeholder involved.</em>\n\n<strong>#Post-Disaster need of Nepal is not an <em>ad-hoc </em>need</strong>\n\nNepal is and always have been prone to natural disaster including but not limited to earthquake, landslide, flooding etc. The post disaster reconstruction this time should include capacity building aspect of locals as well. Let\u2019s construct the human side as well i.e. working towards generating specialized human resources <strong>{pool of specialized human resources}</strong> in disaster management, crisis management, search and rescue, academic, analyst, economist, scientist etc.\n\nWe need expert in these area with contextual knowledge. When we focus on re-construction, we need to focus on this side as well. So, when disaster hits us next time, at least we have specialized people who knows how to lead the volunteers and those who want to help. This will make the effort more effective.\n\n<em>We need post disaster specialist in various domain as Nepal is susceptible to natural disaster.</em>\n\n<strong>#Pre-emptive steps in maintenance and assessment</strong>\n\nThe reconstruction approach should (mutually) promote the idea of pre-emptive maintenance and assessment of buildings. Particular attention is desirable in case of cultural heritage. One of the very pervasive practice of government of Nepal is absence of regular monitoring and maintenance. This is applicable in case of cultural heritage, roads, bridges, government including (including embassies abroad).\n\n<em>So the reconstruction aspect should also alarm government and general public about need and benefits of timely assessment, maintenance and observation of buildings, Sites etc</em>.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">#Nepalese youth and social media</strong>\n\nThe period of earthquake and days aftermath showed us how intriguingly Nepalese youth are involved and active in social media including twitter, Facebook, etc. We should actively use this platform to inform the users regarding the reconstruction and issues associated with it.\n\nThis live in age where information is power and social media is platform for sharing information. The reconstruction program must use social media to share stories, update information and generate public opinion.\n\nThe \u201ccrowd funding\u201d using Facebook as promotional platform and trend on twitter \\#GoHomeIndianMedia shows how much powerful social media can be in creating and sharing opinion.\n\n<em>Social media mobilization must be part of reconstruction as information platform.</em>\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">#Need of Co-ordination and synchronization of effort.</strong>\n\nThe support and helping hands extended to Nepal was unprecedented, however one might argue that it lacked co-ordination and efforts were not synchronized in appropriate manner. There has been news reports of disaster site with overabundance of relief material and some places being unseen and unheard of.\n\nThe mobilization of resources, need assessment, equitable distribution relief has issue of concern and this must be seen as important variable in reconstruction process.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">#Youth leadership and glimpse of hope</strong>\n\nDuring the post-earthquake phase Nepalese youth has shown immense hope with the leadership and volunteering spirit. There has been various notable group of individual, youth led organization that have demonstrated that the next generation of youth more than capable of leadership. With appropriate mentoring and appreciation this youth who are helping Nepal to rise can lead the country.\n\n<em>We need to focus on next generation leaders and need to start mentoring them.</em>\n\n<em>Will come back with more input.</em>\n\n<em>Regards,</em>\n\n<em style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">Barun</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-17 17:57:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.437681", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1212, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2560, 2687], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13920, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2204, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Three things I'd like to explore</b>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>unMonastery:\u00a0craft model to get them economically sustainable without funding.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>#lote3 follow up: is building an economically sustainable format for regular reciprocal project-building and barnraising retreats.</li>\n\n<li>Prototype the edgeryders app and burnout prevention ideas we talked about at \\#lote3 as well as David Bovills big idea.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAnyone else?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-22 00:12:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.695651", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 70, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10676, "user_id": 1966, "topic_id": 2576, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>More Information</b>\n\nHi Alberto, I'd be happy to detail more about my methods and research.\u00a0\n\nFor my eurovision study I did an ethnography of performer and songwriter identity in the contest, something you can access here: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzbJsLqmGVX3RWVIcGRpTlgzcXc/edit?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzbJsLqmGVX3RWVIcGRpTlgzcXc/edit?usp=sharing</a>. For this I interviewed various performers and songwriters by telephone, in person or skype. The interviews were shaped around 10 or so set questions with room for me to deviate and probe further on information given. All participants were asked to document their consent for participation. The outcomes found were that performers find themselves indentifying with the role of national ambassadors as opposed to songwriters who feel their prupose is to generate a text as part of agreed employment. Singer-Sonwriters obviously bridged these two gaps but also felt able to generate a full performance package. \u00a0For my ethnography of the Leeds Music Forum website I was already active in the musical community, and originally started by stimulating threads, but found many wouldn't reply out of disinterest so I decided to follow and engage with psots around topics from the arrival of a new arena to members posting for assistance with performances.\u00a0\n\nMy current research on the Portland, OR music scene is utilising a wider range of ethnographic tools. I am conducting guided interviews and conversations as the main method of collecting data and have done so with individuals, groups and also in focus groups sessions led around specific themes. I have also decided to employ mapping as an ethnographic tool where I have asked participants to draw a map of their Portland music scene and record the conversations had around the creating of this explicit depiction of location. I originally experimented with an online interactive map where users could add and generate content based around personal musical experiences and memories, although moderation was a great issue as well as funding for generating a platform. I have also looked into generating topic specific quesitonnaires although the formal nature may not be suitable for the informailities of the Portland music scene. During fieldwork visit I record my fieldnotes via my research blog\u00a0<a href=\"http://pdxmusicscene.tumblr.com\">http://pdxmusicscene.tumblr.com</a>\u00a0collected not only thoughts but images and videos.\n\nI haven't used either Atlas. Ti or WEFT before but find myself incredibly ammenable to learning how to use new software. Having explored Atlas Ti through their youtube account I feel it is a piece of software I can learn how to use and would happily dedicate time before the ethnographic element of the project begins leaning how to use the software as my university has an academic license with the software and I can seek assistance in being tutored in it. I of course recognise my lack of use may be a hinderance but am inredibly willing to engage end educate myself in it.\u00a0\n\nWe may have crossed path at WOMEX where I volunteered and also networked.

In more general terms, the issue of how to help change makers is quite hotly debated in public policy in Europe, both at the Euro level and at the national one - the UK has the lead, but most other countries are looking into it too. What Edgeryders can contribute to this debate, I think, is above all experience. War stories. So let's search for them: which change makers we know were helped by whom?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-31 17:45:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.599002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 173, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30153, "user_id": 2598, "topic_id": 4400, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>I appreciate the connection</b>\n\nYou've been great, trythis!\n\nI will look into it.\n\nLisa\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-17 21:42:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.068110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30287, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4450, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Perfect</b>\n\nIt seems you understood what I meant - this looks very nice!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 15:56:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.789811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2647], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14252, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6218, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Welcome from me too :-)</b>\n\nAlberto.

Large groups broken down in smaller ones to increase effectiveness.\n\nIt reminded me of the important relationship\u00a0between diversity and scale. Each context &amp; group has their\u00a0own correlation between diversity and scale, and each situation thus has its own sweet spot(s). Small groups tend to lack diversity, yet they are likely to be efficient\u00a0at the few things they do. Large groups tend to follow the opposite rule. Too much diversity in both cases loses functionality. Not enough leads to inbreeding of ideas.\n\nMaybe this has been said already, but I wanted to share it anyway. Your hurdle seems to be very pragmatic, rent and business model, and you're looking to start at\u00a0a relatively small scale. So I think it might be a good idea to reduce diversity at the start. In other words it might be better to start with people who agree on one business model and leave the door open for diversity as context changes, size grows, opportunities arise. Lean methodology wise.\n\nThe potential extra cost of starting in a lean and not-so-diverse way, the potential deficit,\u00a0could be considered an investment in all the lessons that you will learn from starting this way. You\u00a0could structure this investment as a mortgage or loan to\u00a0future users.\u00a0They\u00a0will be benefiting in hard cash when the model with lots of diversity is ultimately in place, as this model\u00a0should be more resilient, economically viable and able to offer lower prices on multiple fronts. It seems natural that dues are paid for what it is built upon. Support from the future community. In financial terms, it would be a relatively standard loan I suppose, though I don't know how realistic it is for you to get one.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-01 13:07:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.826490", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 351, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26660], "is_liked_by": [8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4811, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4778, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.smashingbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Deep-Water-Solo-in-Athens-Greece.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n\nHi all\n\nEdgeryders LBG is looking for an experienced facilitator for an event we are organising on October 1-5.

We can also imagine a highly hierarchical community, taking stewardship role in the Commons \u201cpackage\u201d. However, if we try to imagine a world, where such entities would thrive, we shall see that the governance of such a world MUST must blend P2P and Commons paradigms. A meta-environment, where all phyles interact, has to keep them in P2P relationship and also has to be their Commons. Otherwise, the whole model is doomed from the very beginning (which doesn't mean it isn't doomed anyway).

Lots of people live together who all work for some company. But those are situations where you can go up to your room and shut the door whenever you want.

My experience was at the main place, well known as The Farm, and later at urban centers in New York City and Washington DC.  I lived at the main Farm for six and a half years, in DC five years and NYC less than a year.\n\nWe lived in groups.  The fewest people I lived with under one roof was four and the most was more than thirty.  Adults, singles, teens, kids, babies.  We llived together and worked together. In many cases I worked side by side with the people I lived with, most particularly in the urban houses.  A couple of things stand out as commonalities that made it workable, and I think worthwhile to share beyond just being a good story.\n\nYou have to like the people.  Each one of them.  And if that's hard to do, you have to keep trying to find enough likeble things about them (and they to you) until you gather up enough to make the relationship enjoyable.  And that goes for each person.  Because you are going to be spending a lot of time together.  It has to include plenty of fun times.\n\nYou need basic agreements about commitment.  Once a choice is made to move in, it can't be impossible to get yourself out of being there, but it needs to matter enough that you do not want to give up and leave, or on the other side try to compel someone else to leave, without a clear understanding that first everyone is going to try hard to make it work.  This is a big part of what defines it as different from just living together in a house.\n\nYou need to be honest.  Very honest.  But also compassionate.  When you live together and spend your work day together too, you start to learn a whole lot about the other person and it is inevitable that some of what you discover will irritate you.  What do you do about it?\n\nI think one of the most basic understandings has to be an agreement that it is healthy to be willing to give and receive feedback where the default is being more, rather than less, open regarding permissible subject matter.  Otherwise too many things go unstated.\n\nBut, pushing someone too hard to \"open up\" can be counterproductive and discourage trust.  Initial conversations where people say what they do and don't feel comfortable discussing might be worthwhile.  So, always with compassion and respect but not being afraid to bring something up early before it festers.  Like so much in life, it's about balance.  What should you bring up and what should be tolerated? Suck it up or talk it over?\n\nAnd again, it is directly related to having fun together.  You can do a lot more nit picking when you know you can and will be having a good time again once the air gets cleared.  And you really can clear the air if you stay with it.\n\nPart of the art of this kind of living is being able to admit to something, and express resolve convincingly - right then and there - to do something about it.\n\nThe living arrangements might be egalitarian, but work often has hierarchies, even when trading project leader positions.  It's a challenge to be in charge of something, or at least to have some work-related decision-making authority over someone in your household, and then let go of that arrangement once you are out of work mode.  And often, live/work modes switch back and forth through the day and night.  It takes finesse.  On both sides.\n\nAnd it has to be ok to say something in the way of a personal critique to whomever is in authority.  This too is something that defines live/work as far different than the usual business arrangement where you might get fired if you bring up certain things.  (Even in California where there are lots of worker protections, you can be fired for insubordination.  Thus you don't bring up certain things, you just take it or leave.)\n\nIn the urban phase of group living, in New York and DC we were part of a nonprofit that had specific project goals.  New York was a free ambulance service in the ghetto and DC was a kind of lobbying operation.  In both cases we supported the basic economy of the household by some of us working together as a carpentry crew. It didn't have to be carpentry, could have been something else, but some group-owned unit that makes money.  That way we had more control over our own destiny.  This meant that some people did more work directly tied to the project itself and some people didn't.  That was what I did - work on the money making crew. But we made sure that those of us who worked the non-project job had plenty of opportunity to be an important part of the project itself so that we felt unified.  Nevertheless, it was something we had to collectively talk about from time to time to make sure everything played out fairly in all our eyes.  \n\nThere is no one way to do this.  And I wouldn't want to project onto others too much of my own unique experience because it was pretty unusual and very much of its time.\n\nBut one thing I do know - do not shy away from conflict if you have to talk something over.  But leave anger out of it as much as you can.  Anger is polarizing and should be treated almost like a nuclear weapon.  Don't use it.  Breathe evenly and keep things informational instead of emotional.  Don't make \"you are\" statements.  Make \"I think you are being\" statements.  \n\nRelationships get stronger when you resolve conflict because you carry the knowledge that you can resolve it because you have already done it.\n\nIt's good to know that over time, there can be less need to sort things out because the group arrives at a kind of equilibrium where everyone knows where they stand.", "created_at": "2017-06-03 15:52:22", "updated_at": "2018-06-16 18:16:03.423052", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1113, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 406.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095, 4861, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17626, "user_id": 360, "topic_id": 1241, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>About education and multilayers :-)</b>\n\nDear Alberto,\n\nthanks for your words :-) it is my pleasure trying to contribute on edgeryders.\n\n<strong>About traditional vs unconventional education.</strong>\n\nI can divide my experience with school in 3 different stages. Each one had an impact on my whole life, more than just on \"education\". The first one was from childhood until high school. At this stage I was one of the best in my classroom, everything was easy, and I was much faster than my average schoolmates in learning and doing things. I had incredible teachers, I learnt a lot and I think that these great basics are still important part of my \"knowledge\". At the end of this phase I had to choose for the high school and my teachers offered me the possibilty to choose for any school because of my good marks. So I choosed for Liceo Classico (2 years Gymnasium + 3 years Liceo, a school widely considerated the most difficult, where you are supposed to study mainly Latin, old Greek, Italian and other not scientifical subjects.\n\nHere is when starts the second stage. At the Liceo Classico I was far to be the best one. Actually I never reached great results, having often really bad marks and studying on summer to fix gaps. Why? It was worth? Why not choose an easier school path? Well... I say yes for two reasons: first it gave me a different kind of knowledge more about \"how to think\" than \"pure knowledge\", and secondarily it gave me the right environment where to grow on my teens: at the end we were all good boys and girls, with some shared values, I still have friends from that age and I'm thankful for the whole experience.\n\nBut this was also the time when my critical perspective on \"what we are learning\" started to be more and more predominant. I could tell you many examples but I like this one for the end :-) My marks in chemical/physics were at the minimum if not less. One really cold day I placed my basket ball on the heater waiting for the sports hours (it was not properly inflated and because of the cold even more soft). My female classmate with the best marks did not understood why I made it. I was 16 and a light turned on in my mind: what am I studying and for which reason? Are these teachers teaching me in the right way? Why I'll never have the same marks even if I'm probably more \"mature\" in using the knowledge we learn here? (for the sake of this history, she's now a teacher at the high school eheheheh).\n\nThen the third stage. When I had to choose for the university \u2014 it was still the middle paleolithic: no mobile phones around, can you imagine it? :-) \u2014 all the people were choosing between just few universities, it was no like now when you have a plethora of diplomas, we just had: medicine, law, architecture, economy. I choosed economy because I had a feeling that it was interesting. I tried to enter in 2 major universities in my city and I fail the test. I really hated those tests: 200 pages of drawings and numbers to put in order. So I subscribe for a faculty with no test: Political Science. I made 5 or 6 exams than I had to study a book called \"Storia delle Istituzioni Politiche\" (History of Political Istitutions). 400 hundred pages out of 600 were about the many different governments changes during the French Revolution, when a Government was pointed just for few days. I remember the book and the library, with all those students studying million of pages and a questions running in my mind: why am I studying this? What the purpose? I agree or disagree?\n\nIt was not for me. Too hard to push my mind in something that I was not interested in. I really never understood how people can learn something that they are not passionated about. This is, at least for me, more painful than doing anything else, it is a real torture.\n\nI always learned a lot by my self but the greatest gift was the Internet: all the informations were there waiting for me. As I said in the previous post, knowledge in first part of my career was mainly about \"computer stuff\" (music, graphic, IT, training, writing...). But I had no to attend any lessons: while in my University students were learning from a Professor how to write a simple program in C (the mother of the computer languages, completely useless for 99.9% of the students, as it is food for developers), in one night online with some friends we were able to create a website: who was creating the text, who the graphics, who the code. In few hours the website was published. And it was 1992.\n\n<strong>About multilayered approach to work.</strong>\n\nThere is a great article published by HBR, titled The Making of an Expert by K. Anders Ericsson, Michael J. Prietula, and Edward T. Cokely. The article is an interesting perspective about what is needed to became a real expert in some field: what is really more relevant? The answer is that outstanding performance is the product of years of deliberate practice and coaching, not of any innate talent or skill. Deliberate practice, that's what I always done: I spent hours and hours and hours in reading, learning, trying, doing, searching, listening, asking...\n\nMy believe is that we are not all born to study in the \"conventional\" way, but not everyone wants to became a nuclear engineers (you definitely need a degree if you want to do it :-). But if you do not want to study conventional and you prefer to do different things, do not take any excuses: the path is similar you have to study a lot and there are many ways to do it and to became \"relevant\" in any field, this is the \"knowledge era\", the only limits are in your choices.\n\nOne example: I have a friend who wants to became a singer. We all know that this dream is completely a wasting of precious time, because there are more possibilties that I'll became a Nobel Prize in Medicine than he will ever gain a decent salary out of singing (I'm not saying famous!). But I can take the fact that we all have to follow our dreams. This guy unfortunately is trying as if we still were in 1980: with his networks, links, possibilities. If I ask him: which one is the best school in the world for singers? Who are the best teachers? In which country you have the best chance? He has no answers. No way! Do your best, go for quality, never accept mediocrity, understand when to say no, make choices every day, plan. And plan more than one backup. For example instead of going to work for McDonald to gain the money to be able to enter that school, may be you should write for a music magazine, work for TV, study sound engineering. In short: create other opportunities that could reinforce your main goal but that could became an interesting exit door.\n\nAnd if you are in doubts understanding if what you are doing is really in synch with what you are aiming for... well go back to the \"three circles\"! Which is always a nice tool to check your \"status\" and find new (great) questions (not answers! life is about asking yourself the relevant questions, more than try to find good answers...).\n\nThere are many studies about the fact that in the future we'll have to do many different jobs to survive than previous generations. Life is different now! So I believe that we should encourage the \"multilayer approach\" because it gives you more possibilities to survive in the jungle but also because it gives you more chance to learn and to find out your real Practice.\n\nIf you are looking for real tips... well... as written in the previous post:\n\n\u2014 use your CV as a business plan for your career\n\n\u2014 Subscribe three or four well known job posting websites and their newsletters, use the informations to track your career path: What I am missing? What are my strenght?\n\n\u2014 Never stop to learn: there are millions of websites, newsletters, blogs... and applications to help you log, organize and manage the knowledge. Go for it.\n\n\u2014 Try to create sub-paths/careers linked with your main so that you are always aware about what's going on around your main field\n\n\u2014 Taking a little work for few money but with a great opportunity in learning, it is always a good shot.\n\n\u2014 Create a network on your field: write to journalists, go to meetings, subscribe for conferences, engage in chats (online and offline), be an active members in real and virtual communities. There's plenty of people out there, ready to explain you something new :-)\n\nYes I know, this is really linked with the lifework balance. How to manage this with a life? Well, that's easy :-) In my vision of life there are no layers: there's no work and free time, there's no fun and job, there's no private and business life. I work 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Am I a workaholic? Not at all. I simply have fun in what I'm doing, and when I have not... I try to create the possibility to do it, which is sooooo fun too :-)\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-28 12:52:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.370357", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1661, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1330, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1297, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ddeubel.edublogs.org/files/2011/01/three_wishes-15nory0.jpg\" style=\"WIDTH: 400px; HEIGHT: 291px\">\n\nSomeone asked me today which were my top 3 opengov wishes. <strong>What would be yours, for your State?</strong>\n\nI would like the government of Quebec to make intelligent and appropriate responses that are expected by the people of this province to face new challenges of our time.\n\n1) <strong><span>TAKE STEPS TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY </span></strong>in all areas and for all those involved, by LEARNING TO BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE in accepting calculated risks and incidents for what they are. Adopt a vision and new policy plan to take advantage of rapidly developing technologies and changes. Make the necessary changes so that values are changing in depth, which will lead to replace the culture of this government. Analysis of types of cases of resistance, mandatory training, methods that facilitate a way to work together, regular evaluations of employees and officials, convertion of the supervitory philosophy to an \u2018horizontal supervision\u2019, fewer regulations and more shared responsibilities, etc. Get away from the monolithic leadership model. Re-integrate elements related to the sacred: encourage different values, like listen, observe, emotional bonding with citizens and collaborators, show that you empathize, try to understand others, empower others, be of service together, share wisdom together, trust, etc.\n\n2) <strong><span>BECOME AN OPEN GOVERNMENT LEADER</span></strong> in all areas and for all those involved, by TAKING CHARGE, taking responsibility for the development of open government in each department and institutions of the government, based on transparency, participation and collaboration. Inspire actions, at the municipal level, within the Canadian space, and at the international level. Take bold initiatives. Get out of the comfort zone by taking risks. Set stretch goals that enable to develop new skills. Become a purveyor of hope. Encourage and develop talent, create knowledge and promote excellence, exploite knowledge and add value, provide governance and define frameworks, create incentives and options.\n\n3) <strong><span>DEVELOP SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE (COLLABORATION)</span> </strong>in all areas and for all those involved, by setting DIVERSIFIED STRATEGIES of collaboration with organisations, businesses, other goverments and citizens. Become social smarts by understanding how to use social media to develop social intelligence and social networks. Build effective communities of practice based on co-creation and co-production, knowledge management, e-learning, professional networking and development. Bridge silos, increase collaboration, increase productivity, cut expenses, improve access to information, better manage programs, improve transparency, enhance and accelerate situational awareness and decision making, better serve citizens, and respond more rapidly.\n\n<strong><span>MY TOP 3 OPEN DATA SETS </span></strong>\n\nOpen data is a sub-set of open government. I would like the government of Quebec to releases data of quality rather than a quantity of data that citizens will not know that what to do with. Data that leads to collective knowledge mobilized to process this data.\n\nRelease data, then draw on inspiration, ideas and opinions of organizations, businesses and citizens to solve problems together. Have development phases where people can contribute in a variety of different ways, ranging from applauding inspirations to contributing complex concepts. Being a part of a challenge would requires participants anywhere from a few minutes to many hours.\n\n1) <strong><span>A CHALLENGE ABOUT INNOVATION</span></strong>: The DOSSIER SANT\u00c9, the digitalization of health records in Quebec raised several concerns. Release relevant sets of data, while organizations, businesses and citizen's help are asked to find solutions to improve efficiency in this area. Several problems are associated with the management of this project. They should be analyzed, while not losing sight of the overview.\n\n2) <strong><span>A CHALLENGE ABOUT EFFICIENCY</span></strong>: Since 2000, HYDRO-QUEBEC awarded computer contracts that cost nearly $1 billion. Nearly 40% of them have exceeded the budgets, which doubled the expected spending. Certainly, data sets and information about contracts would help all to see more clearly and propose solutions to improve the efficiency of the government in this area.\n\n3) <strong><span>A CHALLENGE ABOUT CREATIVITY</span></strong>: MUSEUMS have not established a comprehensive strategy to increase their revenues. Using data sets, ask organizations and citizens to seek diversification strategies and re-think the role and missions of museums to contribute to increase their revenues.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-02 22:58:30", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:38:07.708398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 767, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 45.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20538, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4136, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nThanks to Hazem.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-11 09:57:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.396818", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18361, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>made me think of this</b>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8e22637b8a2a404fdf41b22e66a2ba3b6feaebd7.jpg\" width=\"571\" height=\"443\"><br>\n\nCame across this slide in a <a href=\"http://medea.mah.se/2013/08/designing-for-homo-explorens-90-percent-phd-seminar/\">PhD seminar</a>\u00a0by <a href=\"http://www.hobye.dk/\">Mads Hobye</a>. It was a lot about embodiment, which is tricky when it comes down to online platforms. But may be it's the reason why I have this feeling of adding more of a human to the platform. It's a bit like when we try to make \"smart\" things by adding digital technology to analog things and humans but other way around:\u00a0adding humans to digital things and processes as a quick fix to the issues of\u00a0interface design. I'm not sure if design thinkers\u00a0will kill me for that, but I think there is nothing wrong with thinking social before tech.\u00a0\n\nSo to me the question is how to make the community visible through the surface of the platform. Of course, meeting edgeryders in person helps enormously to then feel ok on the platform. Is there any way to do so without real life interaction prior to the jump on the platform? I thought \"guided tours\" because I'm not really a techie.\n\nIf I try to imagine more\u00a0techie solution to the landing strip design it will look more like a map of\u00a0the community: current subjects of discussions and\u00a0levels of activity. I better sketch it, I'm not even sure that the map I imagine is possible to make. The trouble with the implementation of this kind of map is that if you sketch it, the next day it will change, because people jump from one thing to another and new conections happen all the time. So may be, after all, this kind of map is useless unless it is completely interactive, and for this matter will take too much time and effort to make. Getting a human who is already imagining the community\u00a0and possible ways of interaction with it inside of a head sounds rather pre-historic, but I think it should work.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-14 19:57:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.582120", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17502], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19632, "user_id": 2945, "topic_id": 5222, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>HOw to add myself?</b>\n\nHi, I'd like to help document the Master of Networks session, but I can't edit above.

The sacrifice of his life was the only way that he found to demonstrate his point of view.\n\nIn Tunisia, and in many other countries around the world, bloggers are imprisoned, abused, tortured, and many die from their injuries. They sacrificed their human lives simply because they talked, they tried to share their point of view.\n\nIn Quebec, thousands of citizens have been arrested these past weeks, since the draconian Bill 78 has been adopted. Citizens are denied their right to demonstrate.\n\nTwo members of parliament of Quebec, Bernard Drainville and Amir Khadir, have been arrested and will have to pay a ticket (ref. <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/conflit-etudiant/201206/05/01-4532062-manifestations-amir-khadir-arrete-a-quebec.php\">Amir Khadir arrested</a>; Bernard Drainville had to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SebastienRobert/status/210378147730960384\"> pay a ticket</a>)\n\nI don't demonstrate because I am a single mother with the responsibility of a son.

Why do I talk about subject matters that are not normally discussed by other open government activists? What is it exactly, in my personal experience, which allows me to connect multiple factors together, and all link these to my open government activism?\n\nWhen people take the streets, it is usually because the situation has become unsustainable in its most extreme way. How many years before a situation becomes completely intolerable, how long does it take before the bloggers perceive this situation and sound the alarm? During all these years that some far-seeing individuals live with these thoughts of unsustainable government in their heads, carry this vision of intolerance with them, what solutions do they find, in their own points of view, that could improve the situation?\n\nCould we consider the various types of experiences of open government activists, including the \"mainstream\" or \"traditional\" and the more extreme \"sacrifice\" types, and after having looked at all their experiences and understood that they may represent a response to a certain type of (abusive) governance, be inspired by them to propose a diversification of strategies for open government?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 13:43:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.375488", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 833, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28543, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2334, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>The city's</b>\n\nThe building belongs to the city of Matera.

The sad truth is that as society in general we don't trust in our neighbor, let alone a complete outsider. One could argue that the social networks that are permeating our social life help us to trust more and be more trustful, but connection doesn't mean trust, the reality is that trust means something deeper. Trust begins with myself, knowing that myself is able to remain attached to its values, and also knowing that myself is able to set and achieve its objectives no matter the difficulties on the way. Thus, trust begins in myself with values, discipline, temperance, perseverance and courage. Once I know that I can trust in myself, \u00a0just at this moment I'm ready to begin to trust the others. And the trust with the others is built in the same way that the trust with myself: through values, discipline, temperance, perseverance and courage. I know this might sound old, extreme, hard, obvious or whatever, but still, it is something we must practice conscientiously to build trust. \u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>Bottom-up</strong></div><div>A change to be permanent should start from the bottom up. It should start small from the intimate conviction, and from there it must be flourishing and expanding around by example. If we really want a change, we must be an example of this change in order to show it to others. The change should be like a viral infection that starts with a small mutation somewhere and it spreads by contagion in its vicinity. But if that \u201cmutation\u201d is not alive and active, but only existing as ideals, it never spreads around. So in order to change something we need to act, not big actions, but small actions. And we need trust, so that these all small actions will be chaining together in big actions to achieve the permanent change that we want.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>Balance</strong></div><div>For change to be sustainable it must be based on the balance, without balance there is no sustainability. When we are in a bad situation we tend to run to the extremes. As for example, too much technology and we are dreaming of a life without it, forgetting the undoubted advantages that technology is also offering to our life and society. Too much oppression and we began to yearn for a life of total anarchy, forgetting that to live in society we need a minimum set of rules and <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/tale-about-basic-human-decency#comment-3106\">holarchies</a> to organize them. But we also tend to go to extremes with the novelties. As for example, there is Internet and we are connected to it all the day, forgetting that as human beings we need a physical, emotional and mental balance for a true development. And again, we need to be balanced from the bottom-up, starting with ourselves, cause if we are unbalanced is not possible to develop balanced relationships with the others.\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>These three words are applying in the all areas of our social life, the personal, familial and societal. And it is also applying in the different contexts in these areas; they are as valid for the politicians in their relationships with the society that they are representing, as for our interpersonal relationships which are the ones that ultimately determine the society in which we live. It is true that they do not sound too exciting and involve a slow process at its beginning. But if we want to change our current society with one that is social and ecologically sustainable, we first need to develop trust and start to act small from the bottom-up searching by balanced solutions.\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2012-06-26 12:49:01", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 00:27:44.828286", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 713, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 90.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24878, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1030, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>The emergenc(e|y) of the citizen innovator ...</b>\n\nChris, many thanks for your answer and for taking the time to share your conclusion of the workshop. (Also, feel very welcomed at Edgeryders! We're a not-so-established think tank, too. In fact, we don't even exist *giggle* ... an <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033\">inside joke here</a>, ya know.) I completely agree with your evaluation of what we on the workshop were often lacking: communications, some crucial expertise, networks. Now the first (having a hard time to explain ones idea) is in my view just a symptom of the idea being not yet mature. Which is ok for young ideas, but also just the point where professional one-on-one consulting becomes very valuable, as I proposed above.\n\nAlso I'm thankful that you see potential in the social innovation web helpdesk idea. Thanks for the openness \u2013 if anything comes out of this proposal, I'd be eager to hear it ;) Maybe the whole \"citizen innovator\" thing is just so different from how social innovation worked before that it just takes time to develop a mutual understanding? (... and yes, I myself learned a lot about the social innovation world when in Amsterdam).\n\nI should try to make that point clearer, about what I see is different with \"citizen innovators\": In the European Social Innovation Competition, more than half of the entries (314 of 605) came from the so-called PIGS states [<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/social-innovation/\">see</a>]. Which proposes, as is also my impression, that social innovation currently is a kind of emergency self-help of citizens. We're replacing services no longer provided by failing states (forgive the harsh expression, but \"austerity\" is just an euphemism to me ...). The citizen social entrepreneur is quite a desperate person who has no time to lose. Because their society starts to fall apart, and often enough also their own life, so making a business out of all that seems like an ingenious last-resort measure ... . This is why I propose that this group needs some hands-on, detailed social innovation consulting to make proper business ideas out of their ideas. Taking all the time and effort to learn more generic techniques and background knowledge for social innovation has its own merit in academia (may I use <a href=\"http://socialsafari.org/\"> Social Safari</a> as an example), but it's not the most efficient use of expert time when dealing with citizen entrepreneurs. We're on the craftsman level of social innovation instead, and better engage in learning by doing with some expert advice now and then. (And when it's time to study the background of something, the Internet provides usually enough for us, for cheap.)\n\nWhat I'd be interested to know: Is there any shift in what a typical social innovator / social entrepreneur is like, from before-crisis compared to now? My statements above are obviously based on little data and a subjective impression from within my small area, so it would be interesting to get a subjective impression and maybe some more data from somebody who's working in the field way longer ;)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-07 14:27:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:17.726274", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 554, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23531], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 804, "user_id": 3515, "topic_id": 771, "post_number": 1, "raw": "My name is Erika. With Luca, Jacopo and Alice we started\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dynamoscopio.it\">Dynamoscopio</a>\u00a0(\"those who observe change\"). We are a strange mix of designers, researchers, and practitioners of urban transformation. We are anthropologists, architects, economists.\n\nIn 2012 we got interested in a neighborhood called Giambellino-Lorenteggio, in Milan. It was undergoing change, and a tension ran through it. Its eastern end is a heavily hipsterized area, with lofts and cool parties connected with the mighty\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.salonemilano.it/\">Furniture Fair</a>. To the west there are large industrial settlements (Vodafone Italia, for example). Line 4 of the Metro is under construction here. The value of real estate is going up, or soon will. But the neighborhood itself remains low-income, home to many marginalized people. 25,000 people here qualify for subsidized-rent accommodation. Many of them can survive only because they do live in subsidized housing. Many more would have a right to, but the city does not have enough apartments available. So they are stuck in a queue.\n\nThe neighborhood was (and still is) vulnerable to gentrification. It only takes a small increase in rents to price many people out of the neighborhood. We took a political stance that people should not be driven out, and moved in.\n\nFirst we investigated the area, and put our findings into a documentary film (<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/62602757\">trailer</a>). As we did so, we fell in love with the local market,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dynamoscopio.it/portfolio_page/mlo/\">Mercato Lorenteggio</a>\u00a0(henceforth ML). This market had a problem: in 2005 a large supermarket had moved into the area. Its competition was driving many local shops out of business \u2013 including several of those in ML. It was clear that the market was on its way out.\n\nBy then, we had figured out that the neighborhood lacked resilience. Nonlocal Milanese never go there, and why would they? And even the locals do not form the thick web of social relationships you find in a healthy community. We knew one thing: working in Lorenteggio meant spending most of our time dragging people out of their apartments.\n\nWe tried to draw a sort of map of desires and problems surrounding the market. We mapped the social actors around it: the local people, the municipality, the nonlocal Milanese, the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers seemed the most promising agent of change. They are local businesspeople: if the neighborhood does well, they do well. ML itself could serve as a focal point. If we could revive it, we could show the local community that it can work its way out of a bad situation.\n\nSo we did several things.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tWith the shopkeepers, we redefined ML's unique value proposition. The supermarket would always beat us on price, and on opening hours. So we invented a brand we call DOP, Denominazione di Origine Popolare (People's Designation of Origin). This means local products \u2013 Milano is a farming city, with many farms to the immediate south of the city. It also mean \"new local\" products, for example we sell\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eragrostis_tef\">teff</a>\u00a0used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine.</li>\n\n<li>\tWe made it clear that these businesses are the natural allies of the neighborhood. For example, we have solidarity campaigns. One is called \"Fai la spesa per la tua scuola\" (shop for your school). Shopkeepers donate part of their income to the local elementary school. Other local partners expressed interest in participating.</li>\n\n<li>\tWe mobilized the community on restoring the fa\u00e7ade of the ML building. A Milan-based company donated the materials; the local people contributed manpower. Physical work on the space creates ownership and mobilization. Also, it was a great party (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MercatoLorenteggio/videos/1798039877129281/\">timelapse video</a>)!</li>\n\n<li>\tWe pushed the mixed use of ML as a place for culture and socializing as well as commerce. For example, we organize courses of Arabic languages (requested by many migrant families), knitting events, etc. The market has wide corridors, and can host up to 1,000 people.</li>\n\n<li>\tWe moved in ourselves. Dynamoscopio runs a tiny cultural space (20 square meters) inside ML. We offer wi-fi too.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn general, we are trying to reinvent the physical space of ML and the kind of local commerce that it offers.\n\nWho pays for this? We started out with grants. Milan is home to several charitable foundations, and some of them focus on the poorer neighborhoods. With time, we are moving towards a more sustainable mix of revenue streams. Even the shopkeepers, now, are chipping in: this is great, because it a sign of increased sustainability. Also, the work we do in Lorenteggio is good PR, and it helps Dynamoscopio get clients.\n\nWe think we are carers, in a way. We care for the community as a whole, rather than for any one person in it. \"Taking care\" in this context means keeping ML open and thriving; and that, in turn, means contributing to them getting income. The shops in ML are holding the line of the viability of the whole community.\n\nWe are not open by default, but we do use some of the strategies of the open source movement. Example: some migrant families from Arabophone countries wanted courses of Arabic for the children. We helped them set them up, and set them up in the market. The logic is this: if the market becomes an open platform for people to do stuff, more people will go there. This will create more business opportunities for the shops: you went for the Arabic lesson, it makes sense to do your groceries there too.\n\nConsidering, our work with ML is going rather well. In 2012 it was on its way out, with several shops closed: in 2016 all stalls are in use, and the market is thriving. The space has become more beautiful and welcoming.\n\nStill, there are many things we would like to improve. For example, last year we organized two \"swap markets\", and they failed badly. Both events were popular, with a lot of people in attendance. But these were people from outside the neighborhood, many of them hipsters. This created tension, because the locals see them as harbingers that they will be priced out of the neighborhood. Another pain point is that we are unable to monitor our impact. Shopkeepers are reluctant to disclose how much money they are making. We do not even have a system to count the number of people present in the market. We would love to have some kind of tool, but somehow this sort of work always gets deprioritized, there is so much to do.\n\nAlso, we are not sure how much longer we can afford to stay engaged with ML. But we worry. What happens when we stop pushing? Another example: for a while, a guy named Manuel ran a vegetable garden outside ML. People loved it. But when Manuel withdrew, the whole thing dried out. These dynamics look great, but they are not always sustainable.\n\nDo you know of any similar experience? We would love to compare notes.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-21 13:59:52", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:58:11.839693", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1254, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1677, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1644, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/lotepicjpg-1024x768.jpg\" style=\"width: 402px; height: 302px; float: right;\" title=\"\">With the <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/conference%E2%80%9D\">Living On The Edge</a> (aka \\#LOTE) conference, the Edgeryders team at the Council of Europe was trying to kill several birds with the same stone. Bird number one: starting to boil down the staggering amount of ethnographic data on the transition of European youth collected alongside the project to <strong>a synthesis that could act as a common ground</strong>. Even before the conference started we had collected over 400 transition stories with 3,000 comments from over 1,000 registered users: an overarching big picture to parse them is a must if we are to make sense of it. Bird number two:experimenting <em>offline</em> with the delicate <strong>interface between online communities and institutions</strong>. Can we design a format that Europe\u2019s most radical and bright trailblazers and its civil servants can <em>both</em> find meaningful and fulfilling? Bird number three: gauge the <strong>potential for contagion of cutting-edge projects like Edgeryders with the institutions</strong> that promote them \u2013 but then need to give up some control over them to their community of users if they are to be successful at all. Will institutions experience some kind of anaphylactic shock and reject the transplant? Ignore it? Be inspired by it?\n\nKilling bird number one was comparatively easy: we had aimed very carefully. We designed Edgeryders with native support for scientific inquiry. The legal infrastructure is such that all deliverables from the project are licensed in Creative Commons-BY, and therefore can be shared and re-used legally and safely. A volunteer Privacy Manager from the community, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/neodynos\">neodynos</a> (thanks!), watches that we do this without compromising the sense of safety that a public space like Edgeryders should have. We extract data from the network analysis directly from the database, via a Drupal module called Views and an extraction script (thanks Luca Mearelli, my collaborator at the Dragon Trainer project, for writing it!). Both the script and the anonymized data are on <a href=\"https://github.com/dragontrainer/edgeryders-mapper\">github</a>. <strong>We are proudly doing open science here</strong>. So, the rest is really just implementation.\n\nBird number two was hard. As we designed the conference program, I will freely admit it did feel contrived at times. Luckily my colleagues at the Council of Europe \u2013 and especially Gilda Farrell, the head of the division I report to \u2013 were patient if tough negotiators, and explained to us that yes, we do need opening remarks, and three closing speeches. And it is important that we make sure that several institutions are represented, as well as respect the balance of gender and nationality of speakers. This is about legitimacy, and a conference with insufficient visibility of the institutions would have sent the wrong signal that we were just playing around while the grownups were doing the real policy work.\n\nIt did work, though. It worked almost too well. Turnout was huge, with some people coming in from all over Europe, but also from places like South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. The online buzz was just insane \u2013 I don\u2019t think any Council of Europe event had ever become trending topic on Twitter before. The Twitter wall backchannel worked like a charm. There was some disagreement and a lot of frank talk, but all of it was respectful. Everybody I talked to \u2013 both from the community side and from the institutional side \u2013 absolutely loved at least some parts, and learned a lot from what he or she did not like so much. The community went home incredibly energized, and got down to doing the most advanced stuff I have yet seen done within a government project. Check out DemSoc leading a <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-june-conference/mission_case/funding-20-edgecamp-session-dear-funders-letter%E2%80%9D\">collaborative \u201cletter to the funders\u201d</a> to start a negotiation with the funding agencies about rewriting funding rules for increased effectiveness and fairness (I do hope the European Commission reads that one); or Nadia <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/travelling-moneyless-berlin-reflections-road%E2%80%9D\">trying on herself the \u201clife without using money\u201d way of living</a>, guided by moneyless sensei <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/making-living-edge-elf-pavlik%E2%80%9D\">Elf Pavlik</a>. <strong>The Council of Europe behaved magnificently</strong>, showing care and appreciation for the young Europeans who had made the effort to get to Strasbourg. When the security staff agreed to let into the building Elf \u2013 who does not believe in states and refuses to use national ID \u2013 I knew the cultural battle had been won. I learned two things: that a fruitful, inspiring offline conversation can be had between institutions and a self-selected group of citizens; and that prior socializing online is critical to that conversation not disintegrating into squabbling about rules of engagement and what is meant by what.\n\nAs for the third bird, I have neither full information nor the authority to speak for the Council of Europe, or any other institution. I do know that Edgeryders, that started as a completely peripheral project \u2013 just a little money and a couple of lowly temps at the margins of the organization \u2013 has now gotten the attention of the most senior decision makers; and that a prototype is being designed for using Edgeryders-style engagement to elicit input into ministerial conferences on the most diverse subjects. This was before \\#LOTE: the day after we got two new proposals \u2013 one of which is to redeploy Edgeryders as a community of experts advising European cities on how to fight poverty. Funding, it seems, is not an issue. <strong>A door has been knocked down, and the Council of Europe is exploring what lies beyond it</strong>.\n\nIf I were more business smart, this would be where I tell you how hard it was, and how we heroically overcame massive obstacles. The gist of it would be that I am a very smart guy, and you might want to consider giving me a lot of money to work with you. But I am famously not business smart, and the truth is that doing all this has been embarassingly easy. Of course we had to work very hard, but even that is more a consequence of the grueling timeline (seven months from launch to \\#LOTE) than the actual content. It did not take new regulation. It did not require a change in leadership. It did not require innovation, other than some tweaking of Drupal and a few lines of Rails. It did not require flawless execution: we made plenty of mistakes, and I more than anyone.

Slaviyansk was the first city where war has started, and people in Slavyansk are torn and divided in the response to the conflict. Many has lost a lot, and via different development projects, volunteers are trying to restore trust, vision, communication easiness and open-mindedness of people. \"Teplica\" or The \"Greenhouse\" alongside another famous Eastern region project - \"Vilna Hata\"\n\nAfter all the events that took place in my country I wanted to implement a project that would help the city and the country. This project works in conjunction with a similar project in nearby bigger town Kramatorsk  that is called \"Free House\" (also new to the region), but we here there are some differences: \"Teplica\" project is not only doing master classes and lectures like \"Free house project\" but they recruit people, often young people for various initiatives and projects in Slaviyansk. Roughly speaking, if people want to paint benches, the project is initiated by Teplica volunteers and all people around would need to participate too. \n\nThe project is implemented in the old building, which is over 100 years old. They have several rooms that are reserved for different activities. As well as the days of the week: Tuesday - master classes and hand-Maid events, onThursdays - cinema, where films are shown that are non-commercial and that aim to develop vision and skills \n\nWhat are your goals and steps in development?\n\n\"Teplica\" main direction of development - is uniting people,  training of new skills that are useful in the new reality. They also bring up in people - initiative, the ability to help, expanding horizons\n\ndifferent number of people come to their project. The biggest number is 300-400 like on exhibitions of hand-made, which is very significant for the Slaviansk events.\n\nThey teach people to be responsible for their life and the city (improving communication between people). People may watch and learn and be involved. Among  many projects are bicycle parking, painting shops, tours of the city that in the current realities of the conflict are very important (Slaviyansk is an - Ukrainian merchant city in the past and history can teach people how to confront conflict); Book crossing, evening tango nights etc\n\n<a href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/899d069c4ed064a9aad6823b23ada6cc5d18ee8f.jpg\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/899d069c4ed064a9aad6823b23ada6cc5d18ee8f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br></a>\n\nHow many people are in your team?\n\n<span>I have initiated the list of activists to promote public civil activism.

Rehabilitation of the damaged buildings we plan by use of different models of alternative architecture, which is mainly concentrated on cheap or recycled but solid materials, creating affordable house for everyone with the respect of surrounding ecosystem.\n\n<strong>Why alternative architecture? </strong>\n\nSome houses of the village are damaged partly \u2013 needing change of the single wall, while others are demolished till the basement. Total cost of traditional materials are several times expensive and reliance on it only extends housing problem on the way to upcoming winter, while implementation of certain techniques e.g. wall construction with empty bottles or used tires, filled with the clay can significantly advance into entire village rebuilding process. Rebuilding process will take place in close collaboration with local masters inhabiting in the area, so the solidity of the constructions shouldn\u2019t raise any questions.\n\n<strong>What do we expect? </strong>\n\nAt the end we don\u2019t only expect to have finished all the accessible buildings but also to challenge and present how different models of alternative architecture could be implemented in real-life mode, converting village into the open space where the variety of alternative attitudes will be exposed side by side. What we expect can be divided in two parts. To host alternative or experimental architects and enthusiasts to take part in the planning and rebuilding process of the village by sharing experience, donating ideas and physical labor enough to succeed daily. We also expect cultural practitioners from all the interested fields (e.g. art, history, ethno botanic) who would like to have cozy working space in rural Nepal, and on the basis of close intercultural exchange with local community would like to fulfill desired piece of work.\n\n<strong>What do we offer? </strong>\n\nPrivate accommodation, daily meal, working materials, shared studio and free internet access.\n\n<strong>What is the maximum length of the residency? </strong>\n\n5 months.\n\n<strong>Where are we now? </strong>\n\nAt the given moment we have rented one of the damaged houses in the village and are just about to start rebuilding process of the eastern wall.\n\n<strong>When the construction will start? </strong>\n\nBecause of the monsoon season it is impossible to take any continues action at the moment, after the discussion with the local community the best time for the start comes to the first half of November.\n\n<strong>When residency program starts? </strong>\n\nFirst wave of residency program will start in November 2015, by starting rebuilding residence building itself.\n\nApplicants should send Portfolio/CV and the brief description of the desired project (in case of architectural proposals additional information may be needed) to kokavashakidze@gmail.com\n\nDeadline: 5 October, 2015\n\nPlease be patient, confirmation letters will be sent to your email addresses by the late October.\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2015-08-09 21:55:11", "updated_at": "2018-01-11 13:38:33.464526", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 660, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6404, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6371, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_Below is the updated version from 2018-07-27.

References](#heading--4)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. What works</h2>\n\n* strategic financial investments: medium term paid sales work based on concrete deliverables. Example: Anique in the Research Network. Previously, Eva &amp; the Nepal team as temporary = hires in projects with clear leadership and resources; Natalia being paid chunks to run off and produce stories, upload them online in a combination of elements: project with clear leadership and enough resources. \n\n* re-inforcing collaborations among a set group of people to whom we offer paths into the company as board members or regular/ ongoing project work: Turkey retreat 2018; \n\n* small admin help desk (bookings and calendar management like Irene was doing for Alberto), banking and payments (Noemi and Alberto sharing these tasks), and content management (Anu, under Matt's guidance).\n\n* social media drumbeat: none of the directors can take this on; so far we have only managed to source this work through projects - hiring Said, Owen (for opencare, Edgeryders Academy) or Zmorda (OpenVillage, Edgeryders Academy); much to improve here, but it's something we cannot live without.\n\n* working with the same collaborators the second and third time around and training the new generation of i.e. community managers significantly contributed to lower coordination costs and better results (Inge, Hazem, Natalia)\n\n* investing small amounts into relationship building, blue sky exploration for both capacity growth and reflecting on the state of the company and our wellbeing: the Athens Retreat in 2015 (Namahn collaboration followed up); the Turkey Retreat in 2018 are considered by most directors highly worthwhile. (see section 2.4 below).\n\n* _add more here_\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Example strategies (with mixed results)</h2>\n\nIn no particular order.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Growing the EU funded project pipeline</h3>\n\nWe hired a person for an initial 8 month part-time contract against clear deliverables, with possibility of extension. See the [Research Network](https://edgeryders.eu/c/research-network) for more information. Highly successful.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. \"Help us Grow Edgeryders in Brussels\"</h3>\n\nThese were open ended discussions based on a general [Hire Yourself offer](https://edgeryders.eu/t/id/2101) (tested in June-July 2017 with Irene, Yannick). The approach: Meet them and open a discussion to explore what they themselves plan to build for the future.\n\nStarting offer by Edgeryders: for Irene to organise 3 dinners ahead of OpenVillage and help us connect with more local people (<a href=\"/t/design-when-everybody-designs-an-evening-talk-and-dinner-on-design-for-social-innovation-with-ezio-manzini-in-brussels-on-may-8-19-00/4307\">format</a>); for Yannick to co-produce the event: find a venue for Day 1 and organise 2-3 dinners ahead of OpenVillage.\n\nWe didn't pursue this further as there was not enough availability and commitment from those we spoke to.\n\nAnother reflection is that there might have been too much open endedness and lack of timing.\n\nAs of 2018, Maria is volunteering to scout and build The Reef v2.0. To be continued.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. \"Approach us for a project partnership\"</h3>\n\nIt went through [explicit invitation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/id/5948), but also by making this opportunity visible in ongoing conversations with people around us. We join efforts in project funding application writing where community members lead. Tested with Jonathan Melhuish (proposal on climate and sustainability - did not pass), Matteo U (Creative Europe - won, to begin in 2019), Hugi (Tech for Co-created Culture, won!).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. \"Join the Edgeryders company\"</h3>\n\nWe launched an invitation in the aftermath of OpenVillage Festival, October 2017. We later followed up at the Edgeryders retreat in south Turkey, May 2018. The purpose was to grow the core, preferably into teams, or units of business development. We have seen re-confirmed interest and commitment in Edgeryders by a group of a dozen collaborators who got full access to our Company group and Matrix accounts. They are mentored closely by one of the people in the board.\n\nResults: An extension of the Research Team and work to scale it; A reboot of the Culture Squad and new business development work; A sales team focused on private clients works highly autonomously.\n\nWhat we are learning is that new capacity can only be developed both with attention and leadership of at least a director.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. Investing in offline, quality time to build relationships</h3>\n\nAgain, the retreat. Also effective are working sprints where people spend time together for a few days in the same place (Nadia, Hugi, Matteo in Brussels, or Lisbon; Alberto working with Anique from the office; Alex Levene visiting to work on the Culture team, and so on).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-6\">2.6. Investing in long-term remote collaborators</h3>\n\nThis is the case with @anu, who works from Nepal for Edgeryders in a 50% job since August 2017. This is overall a very positive experience so far. Anu has helped us a lot with small tasks in content organization, tech and process improvement, and through that got used to our way of collaboration, our tools, and also learned a lot of new skills (Discourse administration, Inkscape, Python scripting, advanced Google Sheets, git and Github etc.). She'll still some guidance for complex tasks, but always learns through that. So it makes sense and the investment of time on our behalf will pay off but only if this is a long-term collaboration. Assume the first 3-4 months of such a collaboration to be \"slow\", as there is a lot to learn that we take for granted but is absolutely new for others, esp. where work culture is still much less Internet-driven.\n\nMaking this a long-term collaboration means guaranteeing a job independent of project work, paid by the 20% Edgeryders company profits for the most part. Which is possible for a small company like us only due to the extreme value disparities through the currency exchange rates between Euros and Nepalese Rupees (Anu earns 3.70 EUR/h, which, we believe, is an above-average pay for this kind of job in local comparison). It's always difficult to know what is a fair payment in such a situation as we don't want to exploit anyone, but so far, everyone seems to be happy with this :)\n\nThis kind of collaboration only works with the \"right\" people, who are curious, driven and motivated to learn all kinds of things. Definitely applies to Anu, who taught herself Python programming while working for us and now already does some (small) programming jobs for us. It's always a challenge to find these \"right\" people, but in many cases young, well-educated women from so-called \"developing\" countries are fabulous for this. Young well-educated men often are less motivated because they have other opportunities, for example working abroad.\n\nAnother ingredient for this to work is that it needs a dependable and supportive person among the Edgeryders directors for such a collaboration. If that person has a personal motivation to make this collaboration work, it will help a lot. (In this case, @matthias gets a long-term \"assistant\" who can take over Edgeryders tech tasks, and also it helps with keeping a connection to Nepal \u2026)\n\n\n## <h3 id=\"heading--3\">3. What we wish to change</h2>\n\n* that we each end up taking on small tasks which take away A LOT of attention from more strategic work: sales efforts in particular: hosting events at the house, managing admin for whole project teams (contracts, travels for opencare, WB MENA, the Masterclass.. to give just some examples)\n\n* that the bulk of sales efforts is or has, for the longest time, been covered by only two people in the company\n\n* that we miss out on opportunities due to being stretched too thin: this goes especially for Brussels, where growing a network and tapping into work opportunities _systematically_ is a full time job\n\n* investing (not enough) resources into strategic developments: we have a list of small fails we can learn from - The ER Comms Agency; The collaboration with Antiheroes in LOTE5; The ER Culture Squad as projects with a combination of:\n\n    * weak leadership \u00d7 unclear roadmap \u00d7 unknown resources\n    * weak leadership \u00d7 clear roadmap \u00d7 unkown resources\n    * strong leadership \u00d7 unclear roadmap \u00d7 unknown resources\n    * other versions of the above \u2026\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4.

So 1 is the person who is speaking, one is asking active/deeper questions and the third is documenting. From a first person perspective. THEN, this documentation is shared. The first person and the engagement manager work on it together until the first person is happy with it and wil post it on the platform.\u00a0</span><span>We have an interview framework. I would suggest skype calls because it is cheaper, but it is not necessary.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeople dont have to be there with name in places where it is politically a bit more dangerous. So it is also not necessary to have the audio or video online, only if they first person agrees with it/wants it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>QUESTION: But how to transcribe it? Just cut out the uhms and ahs, or summarize it? Because it will be truer if you just cut the uhms and ahs, but then it's also too long and probably uninteresting to read.</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe key are the case studies to unlock the conversation, The community calls will be good, as they will meet their peers. Just make sure that you follow up, dig deeper.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPreferrably the people should be registered on the platform, ideally right away, if possible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHOW ABOUT THE PLATFORM?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow do we promote the platform to people? The stories will be like playbooks, like a learning curve, it makes people smarter and more knowledgeable, and it fosters collaboration!\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn LOTE4 we did something similar as what we would like to do for this project. There is something of value what comes out of this project, that people want, and they can get it when they share their stories. Maybe we can do customized matchmaking, or perhaps we can produce a book that is going to be shared? Or something else?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne thing is that we need to find out what is valuable to each person. Use tasks to define what each person needs as a concrete need. A kind of problem pile. Then the campaign is about driving engagement to complete the tasks\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nsaturdays at this time we have these kind of calls, we should keep it below 1 hour\n\nindividual calls and times decide engagement managers, in english and local language, VERY SOON\n\nwe need to have a deadline for the case studies, agree on milestones so we know we are moving forward\n\n\u00a0\n\nmilestones for casestudies and producing the books and invitiations for local hangouts\n\nend of the day on monday = deadline\n\nonline case studies = June 30\n\n\u00a0\n\ncreate a task based on what needs to be done to move us forward, one task per person\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-30 10:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.582113", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1578, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5128, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5095, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em><strong>\u201cFail. Fail again. Fail better!\u201d Samuel Beckett</strong></em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Everyone loves success stories, but look around you: failure is everywhere.</h2>\n\nProjects fail to deliver, collaborations collapse, systems fail to improve, organisations screw up, people blunder, policies fall short.\n\nIt can happen in small ways, on a daily basis. We plan something and it goes awry. It happens at large scale too. <strong>No matter how smart or knowledgeable you are, however well you plan, it\u2019s impossible to go through life without things suddenly taking a turn for the worse at some point</strong>.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">It is an uncomfortable subject.</h2>\n\nMost people are reluctant to admit to failure. Social pressure tends to encourage us to pretend to be competent and unrealistically perfect. So we ignore failure, deny it, refuse to change, and things keep failing. Evidence of this dynamic can be found everyday in large systems such as: \u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Health and social care</h3>\n\nWelfare is the safety net of society. Its failures are everywhere around us, but often are vested with narrative values that transcend its original socio-cultural substrate. A suicide, somebody giving up on a career to become a family care giver, a student drop out, a veteran affected by PTSD turning tramp, and so many others, are all ultimately failures of welfare. However, there is growing feeling of distrust towards this mechanism: after all also a Country\u2019s coverage of maintenance costs for a royal palace is welfare, and with moralism infecting the very root of capital culture, welfare is cloaked in the guilt of dispersing resources on people who did not try hard enough, whose \u201cpersonal resilience\u201d were not worthy of surviving the healthy natural selection of the market. Arguably, welfare failure is often a larger failure of society, of its culture of cohesion and mutuality. Should we single out specific instances of a failing system? Should we fight the cultural drift that segregates a welfare system? Or should we redesign the safety nets to meet the end goals in ways that are acceptable within the new understanding of society that is spreading?\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Development work\u00a0</h3>\n\n<span>[add here]</span>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Financial markets\u00a0</h3>\n\n[add here]\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Cultural and creative industries\u00a0</h3>\n\nWe know cultural funding via grants is dying. Yet we keep banging our heads against the same wall. This makes it much harder to build self-sufficient, sustainable projects. We need new business models, but how can they permeate our cultural habits, legal frameworks and use of technology in order to reward and be perceived fair by producers, multipliers and consumers of culture alike?\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Reception of Refugees and Migrants</h3>\n\n<span>[add here]</span>\n\n<strong>...and these are just the ones we could come up with top of mind.</strong>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">So what can we do?</h2>\n\n<strong>In an ideal world, we acknowledge failure, we talk about it, we learn from it and then implement what we have learned.</strong> We get better or get different\u2026. Nassim Taleb\u2019s marvelous book \u201cBlack Swan\u201d describes unpredictable events of large magnitude and consequence. He suggests that, since you can\u2019t predict black swan events, a better approach is to build robustness against negative ones that occur and be able to exploit positive ones. This means accepting and preparing for failure as a part of doing, well, anything.\n\n<strong>Setting up a new project </strong>or business venture, challenging a large institution to take on a new approach towards policy-making, lobbying an institutional funder to rethink their strategy or getting a government to fix broken policies <strong>is setting yourself up to fail</strong>. Because the outcomes of our efforts are often unpredictable- especially if we are navigating complex adaptive systems (like the economy). If you are determined enough to keep at anything long enough, you will eventually have some successes. But how do you survive the failures on the path to getting there?\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Better together.</h2>\n\n<strong>We hereby send out a rallying cry - failures of the world, unite!</strong> \u00a0Sharing both successes and failures with others can help to limit the damage, help us learn, make us braver.\n\n<strong>There is something liberating about accepting the worst scenario as a possible outcome of any new endeavor</strong>...and then just going ahead and doing it anyway.\n\n<strong>We are not starting from scratch:</strong> Edgeryders has some experience in pioneering new ways of cat-herding large numbers of individuals to collaboratively make sense of challenging topics. Our annual community gatherings, Living On The Edge, are built by participants as knowledge engines. We meet, think, learn and have fun together while collectively building valuable relationships and knowledge...as well as setting the foundations for new collaborations and projects to emerge. Everyone is welcome to contribute what they can and every contribution is valued. Whether it is running a session, making a video or baking a cake.\n\n<strong>We hereby convene an international gathering on the theme of failures. </strong>We believe the ability to come together to fail forward in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future. The gathering is meant as a locus to exchange information and practical knowledge on how we can put the stock of underutilised knowledge from recognising and dealing with failures to a better use. We are already in deep conversation with many people and groups working in health and social care, development, cultural and creative industries as well as in finance.

It can involve a lot more people than a purely technical hackathon, and can break down well into small tasks. e.g. imagine if edgeryders got a gig preparing some report, and we (at least partly) wrote it through hackathon-style collaboration.\n\nFor more technical hackathons: I've also proposed <a href=\"/t/hack-necromancy/3617\">hack necromancy</a>\u00a0as a theme. I'd also be interested in anything else, provided it has a well-specified and plausible objective. I'm much more interested in hackathons to <em>continue</em> an ongoing project, rather than always trying to build something new.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-10 18:34:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:54.401757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 479, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22048, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1318, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>+ 1</b>\n\nNoemi, my point exactly!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-01 09:08:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.843179", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7244, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5199, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'll set up a separate FB event page for it</b>\n\nonce you share the final text?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-27 15:24:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.622520", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22207, "user_id": 32, "topic_id": 1268, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Empathy is key</b>\n\nAlessia, thanks for your comment.\u00a0\n\nWell, to answer your question we were 3 weeks in Colombia, 2 weeks in India and 1 week in Sicily.

It will take me some time to unpack all this. You seem to have a knack for crunchy, sharp soundbites.

But the overall lesson is clear: integrity is paramount. If you feel you are doing good, solid, useful work you can go a long way on very little in the way of material rewards.

Given a home and a card to access the library, the gym and the canteen you could survive pretty much on zero money. Would I? Totally. It would be so much <em>freedom</em>: be fed, be given housing, access to knowledge and fellow humans and not have to worry about money because there is pretty much nothing to buy.\n\nSe, here's the gist: I don't work for a living. I do work; I somehow make an income. The two things are not strictly related. If I were rich, I would do exactly the same work.

You reform the education system, you are going to see the results in 15 years, when todays first graders finish college.\n\nEven incrementality does not always work. If you don't allocate nine months, you can't bear child, and doing it into three chunks of three months each is not going to do the trick.

It favours use of enjoyable, play-based physical activities and emphasises placing individual mental health within the larger political context.\n\nPredictably enough, given my day job, my bias is towards body-based practices, or at least forms of psychotherapy that incorporate some aspect of physical engagement - I don't know if @ybe already incorporates these ideas in her practice, and in any case other forms of psychotherapeutic intervention are also very effective.\n\nBut the advantages of this kind of approach, as I see it, are:\n\n- They engage with the somatic anchoring of trauma, bringing quick results.\n\n- The physical nature of the practices can help overcome language difficulties, which might be useful in a scenario like Calais.\n\n- They can be applied efficiently in a group setting - rather than waiting their turn to speak, everyone engages in the practices at once.\n\n- Because individuals can continue to use the exercises outside the therapy session, fewer sessions are necessary, meaning lower costs and/or more people can be seen.\n\n- Somatherapy in particular also emphasises the importance of group work as part of building a community of solidarity and support in the face of potentially oppressive political situations; moving beyond reliance on external care to develop personal and political assertiveness.\n\nOf course, acupuncture is also used extensively in relation to trauma, either alone or as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Organisations like <a href=\"http://www.worldmedicine.org.uk/\">World Medicine</a> run <a href=\"/t/community-acupuncture-an-ongoing-mutation/638\">multibed acupuncture</a> projects in places affected by natural disasters, war and poverty.

Confirmation will come this week.\n\nThank you Maria for taking the lead on this and all the work so far, over the next few days I'll be feeding a lot into the process.\u00a0\n\nSo there's a couple of questions I think only <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0can answer; Given that we're working with Italian public money, what are the roadblocks that prevent us from funding new unMonasterians in the building? Are we bound to doing another call for participants, or can we just pick people in Matera or further afield that we think are right for the project? What boxes should we be aiming to tick?\n\nSome thoughts and rules I would recommend:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The absolute minimum stay for a funded position (per-diem) should be 2 weeks.</li>\n\n<li>Funding travel should only be applicable to those who can commit at least 2 months.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Anyone wishing to join the project should pledge to a certain set of conditions (integrate into cooking/cleaning contributions, active public reporting/sharing of their time here on EdgeRyders and elsewhere, core focus on ensuring the continuity of the overall unMonastery project in Matera etc)\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Those joining at this point should either have a solid project that is already underway, well resourced and matches up well with both the challenges and context of Matera OR be able to join or support an existing project (see the <a href=\"/t/opentechschool-matera/569/come-stay-at-unmonastery-and-teach-at-ots\">post about OTS</a> as an example of this)</li>\n\n<li>Commit to agreed 'Recipes' see below.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, Recipes.\u00a0\n\nI think we should devise patterns for durations of stay so that we can set out very clear expectations of those coming to stay at the unMonastery, this could be composed of something like this.\u00a0\n\n1 Week Stay:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Cook 4-6 Meals\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Teach 1 Workshop\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>1 Public Post\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>2 Contributions to an existing project</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOther ideas regarding occupancy.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Coupling with Joseph Grima's cultural program; it's inevitable that this program will involve residencies, at the present moment I struggle to see how MT2019 can competently create the infrastructure required to run an international residency program. It makes sense that the unMonastery should accommodate this kind of collaboration - it makes double sense given that Grima's track record of shows suggests a strong overlap of values. <a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/05/17/adhocracy_the_thirdindustrialrevolution.html\">Adhocracy</a> being a fine example of the sort of work unMonastery is designed to host. Also it should be noted that what we've budgeted for is an extra two months with 6 unMonasterians, which leaves at least 2 beds available.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/\">Erasmus Entrepreneur</a> program, this is something that <a href=\"/u/andrea_paoletti\">@andrea.paoletti</a>\u00a0has been working with for CasaNetural, it's certainly something we should consider, <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0am I right to think that you have a good understanding for how this works?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>I've been thinking a lot recently as unMonastery as the possible soft infrastructure for large global software projects, particularly in respect to speculative plans for a rural iteration of unMonastery - and how this might support the development of the <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/\">Open Source Ecology project</a>. I'll be putting a post out when I have time next week.\n\nBut I think it could be very beneficial to reach out to projects like this and offer a residency place for a programmer that wants to give a significant chunk of time contributing to a code based project with unMonastery as their base - on the proviso that they commit to X number of workshops as part of Open Tech School. Think of it as the unScripture element of the unMonastery. Perhaps Mozilla or others would be interested in such a proposition, what do you think <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf Pavlik</a>?\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nLastly, there are still many question marks sitting over the future of our time here, the impression I have from MT2019 is that can't easily grant more funds to the project after July, politically at least - so this makes it very difficult to plan going forward - <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0are you in any position at the moment to give clarity as to how EdgeRyders contractually will be involved in Matera this year beyond unMonastery and how this will feed into or support the continuation of unMonastery?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-27 18:53:37", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:47.109819", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 869, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17133, "user_id": 1801, "topic_id": 2464, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I know some of those Eudea peeps, I will ping them on the list serve and ask what's up.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-05 00:44:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.719234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14274], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10059, "user_id": 1543, "topic_id": 5127, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>joining MoN</b>\n\n<div>I asked some info to <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>; here's a couple hints about what we can expect:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the hackathon will start slightly earlier than 10 and there's no planned ending.\n\nIf I got it right, there is a chance for it to keep going on Sunday (depending on the level of participation).</li>\n\n<li>there will be a brief, which would be ideal to hear; but if we miss it, it is likely that we can get some help to catch up.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAnyone who can expand on this, please do: any additional hint would be ace.

Looking out, I imagined the blinking light on top of a transmitter tower as a boat on the ocean, or a light aircraft over the Sahel - the town has the feel being on the edge of a great unknown, heightened by the even greater unknown of where our apartment was. In the end we found it by chance, just as panic was beginning to take hold.\n\nIn the daylight you can see across the valley to rows of caves, some of which are tiny churches with peeling frescos on their walls. Even in the daylight the old town is uncanny, there are so few people there. Before tourism made the Sassi an economic asset, the Italian government moved people out of the medieval caves and into the new town, they are only now moving back.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/\">unMonastery</a> is at the cusp of the Sassi's ravine, the right place for a conference called Living On The Edge; the walls of an ancient cellar rubbing off on your shoulders as you listen to <a href=\"/u/emmanuele\">Emmanuele</a> talk about memories of abandoned Italian villages.\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_903\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); text-align: center; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px 0px; -webkit-user-drag: none; width: 780px; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);\">\n\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\" style=\"-webkit-user-drag: none;\"><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/33afa84db8a695af813d41fcf2668a71409ab806.jpg\" style=\"-webkit-user-drag: none;\"><img alt=\"Unmonastry, from the other side of the old town\" class=\"wp-image-903 size-large\" height=\"577\" src=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_20141027_115520-1024x768.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px none; -webkit-user-drag: none;\" width=\"770\"></a></dt>\n\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\" style=\"font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; padding: 0px 4px 5px; margin: 0px; -webkit-user-drag: none;\">Unmonastry, from the other side of the old town</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\n\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_904\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); text-align: center; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px 0px; -webkit-user-drag: none; width: 780px; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);\">\n\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\" style=\"-webkit-user-drag: none;\"><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_20141025_172153.jpg\" style=\"-webkit-user-drag: none;\"><img alt=\"Unmonastry, from across the ravine\" class=\"wp-image-904 size-large\" height=\"577\" src=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_20141025_172153-1024x768.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px none; -webkit-user-drag: none;\" width=\"770\"></a></dt>\n\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\" style=\"font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; padding: 0px 4px 5px; margin: 0px; -webkit-user-drag: none;\">Unmonastry, from across the ravine</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n</div>\n\nThe introductory session nicely bookended the LOTE spectrum between <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmchase\">Robin Chase</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leashless\">Vinay Gupta</a>. Robin is a Zipcar cofounder and her call was for us to look for \"excess capacity\" in the system and investigate ways to unlock it. If Zipcar unlocks the value of our underused cars through sharing them, what else could we bring that model to?\n\nCompare with Vinay's call, of similar kind but utterly different extent: to modernise anarchist theory, cease relying on the government, ignore the market economy and form radical cooperatives that act in our own interests using the internet as a platform. Charities be dammed, they are cut from the same cloth as the corporates. Zipcar type models are encompassed via the theoretical construct of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_labor\">guard labour</a>, but it doesn't stop there; climate change, wars and everything in between are in Vinay's purview.\n\nTo round off the picture, <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">Fra. Bembo</a> pointed out that everyone would have to clean the toilets, and Jeff (who was dressed variously as a chef and a bin man over the weekend) spoke out in support of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_minimum_income\">guaranteed minimum income</a>, which I think is rapidly becoming a hobby horse for me.\n\nThe stewardship in the title refers, I think, to the idea of an individuals or organisations that attempt to maximise the social benefit of a resource for non-financial reasons - people who 'steward' a resource. But the topic that kept recurring is actually the Zipcareque sharing economy. Similar idea, getting more value by sharing resources, but, crucially, driven by market forces rather than cooperative benevolence. This tension came out at the plenary at the end of the first day, with the question \"Is Airbnb bad because it makes room sharing, which used to be a gesture of friendship, into a financial transaction?\"\n\nThe answer that Robin gave, and which I'm inclined to agree with, is that before Airbnb existed people mostly didn't let their spare rooms, because there was too much friction in the transaction. The new 'sharing economy' has probably displaced very little benevolent, non-monetised sharing activity, with either cars or spare rooms. Airbnb is straight out of VC-funded, bubble-valley, hypercapitalist California. I might not like the way it's come about, but I can see the value of what it enables as despite the economic system in which it arose.\n\nYou might have guessed that by now I have an affinity for Robin's way of thinking, and I think one of the most interesting things she posited was the idea of market failure in the sharing economy. Using economic theory as a lens in very helpful for me, but, I speculate, a total turn off for most other people at the conference. In any case, a massive case of market failure occurs around personal data, where people simply cannot understand the value of their personal data, and the way it aggregates to become incredibly powerful.\n\nSo that's the cut-and-dry economics, but, much more than ever that ever before, [Patrick](https://edgeryders.eu/u/patrick_andrews/summary) persuaded of a rational position which is sceptical of economic theory. In his view, using money to value things causes people to have a different psychology. It makes it easier, for example, to abuse natural resources, because it makes them abstract. So when I explained that the market is a wonderful way of allocating resources, that it does a magical computation to prioritise what people most want, he agreed. But at the big scale, the environmental scale, the use of money causes this damaging psychological disconnect. When people explain to me why they don't like economics, I often feel it's because they don't get how powerful it is, our conversation didn't follow that pattern.\n\nWhich leads me to the unconference session that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HKaplinsky\">Helen</a> and I lead, Art Vs Science. As a spur to discussion, we divided the world into Tribe A - scientists and techies - and Tribe B - Artists and the academic humanities. I proposed that the tribes need to recognise their cultural differences and reconcile them, Helen argued the tribes didn't really exist like this, and that in any case the differences in culture were a good thing. <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Art-Vs-Science-WCxT1nE8unW\">More is available in the notes</a>, but we did find that the tribe model rang at least a little true with the experience of those in the Unmonastry. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katausten\">Kat</a> was especially good in the debate, bringing lots of useful ideas. I was interested to learn that artists-in-residence at CERN only get three months, those running the program worry  the artists might go native and start thinking like scientists otherwise.\n\nOne funny conclusion was that even though Helen identifies as Tribe B, and I identify as Tribe A, we both perceive ourselves to be in the minority - at the conference and in wider society. Obviously impossible.\n\nListening to the talks I noticed a recurring structure in presentations. Someone would advocate for some kind of action, then we'd lament that not many people agreed with us. This was followed by the idea that 'people' should be re-educated so they will want they same thing we do. eg. People should use encryption on the web, but they don't see the value, so we should re-educate them so they do. People shouldn't go to supermarkets, but they do, so we should re-educate them to not.\n\nIn discussion with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/enzensberger_t\">Theresia</a>, I realised how pervasive this type of thinking is - to the point where I've certainly articulated it myself. It's not a completely fair analysis, but it gave me something to think about.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cameralibre\">Sam</a>, who was videoing the gathering, told me he was having difficulty making the Sassi look real on screen. In the diffused light, with buff-colour tufo buildings between grey ravine and the grey sky, the town looks as flat as film set. In fact Pasolini's films and Mel Gibson's Passion of The Christ both used the Sassi as a backdrop, as will a remake of Ben Hur.\n\nAt the same time the Sassi is more three dimensional than any modern town. Buttresses fly, shoulder-width steps wind through, over, under. One man's pavement is another mans roof. The bedrock is a Swiss cheese of human activity. When we arrived at the apartment we were led through a tiny cupboard-style door under the stairs, down a staircase and into a cellar space the size of a 4 bed London flat. There's a story that at another conference a local showed a someone into his house, to show how it connected to the cave system. They went deep enough to end up under a church, looking into a pit of human bones.\n\nGod knows what else is under there. One of the town's churches (wonderfully called Chiese Rupestri di San Nicola dei Greci e Madonna delle Virt\u00f9) intersects with an older church carved into the hill. No one knows how old the older church is, the first docmentation comes from the 14th century - maybe the question doesn't even make sense, geology and architecture elide in Matera. In 1991 they discovered a Roman cistern, hiding, unknown, below the town square, under everyone's feet.\n\nThe time dimension warped too; in the way that three days a Glastonbury feels like you've been away for a month.

While I was reading the post I was nodding my head and realized that I myself am filled with assumptions regarding the project which influence my way of reacting, participating and promoting the unMonastery. I'll start by telling you what I realize I percieve of the project, and how this has influenced my taking the voice (or not) in the making-of. Please bare in mind that this is really my personal opinion, shaped upon my very partial experience of the process, and my inevitably subjective knowledge of the local community and the mt2019 process.\u00a0\n\nThe core ambivalence of the unMon lies, in my eyes, in this semi-public semi-hacker, half voluntary half paid situation. This is not a criticism, it's a fact. Which comes with consequences, and one of them is that I, for example, do not understand what's going on really, and I am not sure who to ask and if I can take initiatives. For example, this is what I saw from the outside. The first workshop was completely organized on a voluntary basis, with MT2019, ER and the webteam collaborating and creating momentum. Personally, I think it was a great success. I was not able to come to the second WS, so I cannot express my opinion, but from the outside I didn't feel much coming from it. Was it the date? Was it the organization? Was it the theme? I do not know, but something didn't pass (correct me if I'm wrong). What I understood was that a contract was made with Andrea Paoletti, so he was going to be in charge of the community management and all that comes with linking the unMon with the local community. From then on I didn't really know how to contribute, as - how I see it, and maybe I am wrong - if there is a paid contract with someone, that makes that person in charge and responsible of giving input and directions. Which I never got. So things just faded, and I find that's a great pity because it is so hard to get the momentum, especially in Matera where people get dissappointed easily and are quite sceptical. The unMon, still today, has a great sympathy capital in the local community: do not disperse it, cultivate it and take good care of it - especially, do not take it for granted.\n\nThe call came out: here again, apart from promoting it and dying to know about how many people will apply :-) I don't know if we can take some action on the side. If so, how? Can we start building on the unMon when the people that are going to be aprt of it have not been selected yet? For example, I have some proposals (like anyone) for some stuff that could be done to facilitate the \"interface\" dimension of the unMon, but I'm not the one who's gonna live there, so is it really up to me and others to speak about this? On the other hand, 2-4 months is nothing: it would be really sad if half of the time spent at the unMon is passed discussing on organizational matters. To make it clear: should we already decide, for example, that Sundays are the interface days where the unMon is open to Materani? Or should we already say that once a month there's a pop up party? And already start communicating that the Economy App will be the way to exchange with unMon (on this I still have to answer the great thread going on with Matt!)?\n\nThis said, now that you posted this, I'm back on track: here's my reactions to the points you shared:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>defined roles: first of all, I don't get how the online participants are going to collaborate with the selected unMonastarians. For example, I would love to committ to Facilitator of Communication and Community: who do I say this too? Where does this fit in the picture and what is needed? Is it only a matter of speaking Italian? Or is it also about being physically present in Matera? If so, I need to know: action can be taken in this sense :-) the point here is that there is stuff which is linked to Matera and the ongoing unMon, but stuff has to be done on the side anyways. I have stumbled upon different funding opportunities, and everytime I thought of the unMon. And then stopped because I wondered how can a distributed group of people apply for funding? And if it's for funding the idea, and the idea passes, would you (in general) go for funding a social enterprise? the unMon as a spin-off of a spin-off?</li>\n\n<li>task model: yes! Now!</li>\n\n<li>landing strip: website and downloadable booklet (or SlideShare)? The latter could be helpful for people who want to present the project to potential local administrations. Something like: the 10 core principles, what is needed, what it has to offer...</li>\n\n<li>informal discussion space: I think this is going to be needed especially when the unMon are going to be selected. It could be a way to start animating the discussion between ER, unMon and hopefully Materani. could this happen on the ER platform or would it have to migrate elsewhere?</li>\n\n<li>organizational chart: SOOOO needed. I don't think I have a picture of who's collaborating to the unMon. Also, there are different types of participation (different not in quality, but in the impact that they have on the making-of, although ALL are valuable). For example, you speak of the \"core team\": I don't know who this core team is. It would be great to have a chart (evolving and not fixed) with faces and two sentences to describe the role.</li>\n\n<li>Buddy system: 10 times yes. Otherwise it's a promised burnout. So I'm back to the question: how many are we exactly?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat are the next steps? How I see it there is a set of activities and people which are going to focus on the Matera unMon. But the unMon is a bigger picture. We can go on elaborating for years, online, the narrative of the unMon, but if it doesn't go live, develop and replicate it's all wishfull thinking. At the same time, as you said, one thing is having resources for the site-specific unMons, one thing is having resources for the overall project. I often have access to funding schemes, but they go with issues such as elegibility criteria and all that stuff. who do I pass them on to? And if we find something interesting, is there someone ready to write the bid with me?\n\nI will start by proposing here the last that passed through my hands:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Open until the 28th of October: <a href=\"http://associazione.italiacamp.it/news_regioni_view.php?id=170&amp;camp=21\">here </a>you will read about it (in Italian)</li>\n\n<li>Open from the 4th of September: <a href=\"http://www.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;;view=article&amp;viewType=1&amp;idarea1=593&amp;idarea2=0&amp;idarea3=0&amp;idarea4=0&amp;andor=AND&amp;sectionid=0&amp;andorcat=AND&amp;partebassaType=0&amp;idareaCalendario1=0&amp;MvediT=1&amp;showMenu=1&amp;showCat=1&amp;showArchiveNewsBotton=0&amp;idmenu=2263&amp;id=2028148\">this </a>is much more serious in its implications as it requires to open a SRL located in the Southern Italian regions. 4 years support plan, max 200.000\u20ac for new enterprises. Eligible costs: salaries and material. As I told you, I had this in mind for the Sicignano delgi alburni proposal.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo this is a first wave of inputs. Sorry if it's more questions than proposals, but I guess that before going on with proposals I need to get a better picture. As I said, I realized while reading you that the picture I has was more unclear than I thought, and actually I was (and probably still am) filled with assumptions.\n\nMaybe a good starting point to get back on track it to roganize the LOTE#3 session on the unMon? My mind immediately goes to how to involve Materani again in the design process. At this point with a more defined picture to get their reactions and proposals. What do you think?\n\np.s. Are Friday community calls also for the unMon?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-02 09:31:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.143573", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1465, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26810, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5547, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Already approved in the proposal and grant agreement</b>\n\nHi Luce\n\nThe grants have already been approved as part of the winning proposal, they are an explicit deliverable and an absolute requirement for successful engagement of people in the project.

United Estonia succeeded because it did not transform into a caricature of itself - a real political party, from what I understand.\n\nIn Poland we have an opposite example - a political movement led by Janusz Palikot, a former high-ranking member of the currently ruling Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) party. The movement transformed into a party in 2011 and won a surprising 10% of votes in 2011 parliamentary elections. On one hand, the party did \"stretch\" the political debate in Poland by introducing such issues as legalizing soft drugs, gay and sexual minority rights (and brought into the Parliament the first transgender MP, which was extraordinary in largely conservative Poland), or an anti-church stance. But it also quickly became visible that the party is very populist, lacks a real political program or a expert support. At the height of the ACTA issue, the party came into parliament in Guy Fawkes masks, but failed to have any meaningful impact in the debate otherwise. So it was ultimately a facade of an alternative political movement. Tellingly, the party was unable to chose a different name than \"Palikot movement\" (after its leader), confirming a \"strong leader\" model dominant in Polish political scene. I'm writing this to demonstrate, that while there seem to be openings for alternative approaches in every national political system, they're not always used by an actor as smart and good-intended (as I understand from Daniel's description) as United Estonia.\n\nOne other example comes to my mind of a transformative process. Poland has been dealing rather intensively with a range of regulatory issues related to digital technologies (including, alongside ACTA, proposals to block internet in Poland, data retention issues, copyright reform) since around 2009-2010. The most succesful process was a quasi-formal consultation mechanism called \"the Dialogue group\". Controversial due to the fact that to some extent it did not have clear legitimization and representation mechanisms - but at the same time drawing into a constructive process of debate a large range of both representatives of public administration and NGOs / experts / civic society. I participated in the process firstly on the part of the government, and later as an NGO, and I think that this direct debate was crucial in solving several issues in a better rather than worse way. I'm mentioning this because I agree that the way forward is through more participatory mechanisms. Traditional, party-based politics were not present in this process, and political parties in general seem largely unable to deal, especially in an expert manner, with issues of complicated regulation of the digital reality.\n\nIt would be interesting to map these alternative entries into the traditional political system, and attempts to transform political communication towards a more participatory one, in our region. I think they're crucial from a generational perspective, as young generations, through the experience of digital communciation, are becoming accustomed to wholly different patterns of engagement. And more and more alienated from traditional politics.\n\nI recommend to you the \"<a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2012/02/22/web-kids-manifesto.html\">Web Kids Manifesto</a>\" written by Piotr Czerski in early 2012, at the height of the intensive debate around ACTA that took place in Poland\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-08 08:20:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.142792", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 581, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26247, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1549, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Really good work</b>\n\nWow, this session is shaping up very nicely!

Summary</h2>\n\nSpot the Future Bucharest is a pilot project to discover the citizens in Bucharest that are activating outside the formal cultural arrangements - cultural activists and innovators whose voices are less heard and slightly unusual. They are not concurential to the status quo, but they are operating with limited resources. We would all stand to benefit from their experiences and expertise, and it could be that what they\u2019re doing points to a whole new, yet plausible vision of the future of the city.\n\nWe do this by engaging on an online platform and in collaborative workshops, and connecting individuals with each other. The newly formed community is open to anyone wishing to share their experience with their national and international peers.\n\nWe have two things we would like to achieve in Bucharest:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tScan the future of culture as seen by its activists, the kind of future that is driven with integrity by deeply creative people, initiatives and their methods</li>\n\n<li>\t\tLay the groundwork for open collaboration as the new cool thing in town. Aside from looking to build a community of cultural activists \u2018on the edge\u201c, Futurespotters has at its core key values that carry themselves throughout the process: radical openness, transparency, collaboration at all steps of running a cultural initiative or event.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThis report outlines the first two months of activity and summarizes insights from the community, in an attempt to point at collaboration opportunities and how the community can grow and become more resourceful as part of Bucharest\u2019s bid for European Capital of Culture 2015.\n\n<h2>2.

Shape of the network:</h2>\n\nWe use research tools to make sense of the massive amounts of knowledge - for example, we do network analysis of the Edgeryders platform conversation to understand how the network grows and how members are connected to each other. Every node (dot) is a user and every edge (arc) is a relationship with another user, resulting from their interaction online (user \u201cCiprian\u201d commented one other person and has been commented by other two persons). This is useful because we can \u201cweigh\u201d what people say with measures of graph centrality that the literature on social networks associates to authoritativeness- being a central node means this person has been validated before in interaction with others in the community.

I am from Obolon district in Kiev, and I had a desire to help people in some way. Thus I have chosen a park in my district to improve. Due to Maidan event, there was a high level of civil activism. I had  desire to decrease social conflict and tension via realizing a project of civil collaboration on a social cause. I have chosen park in our district due to the fact that it was in a very poor condition. Have started with a meet up with Urbanist, who has provided me valuable insights on how to express social questioning within the community, how to negotiate with the inhabitants of the district etc. My aim was to establish collaboration between citizens, business and power. I was searching for active citizens at first, than experts in various fields. For almost half a year there was a preparation stage of the project. We initiated the project with couple of Subbotniki, which means social actions on Saturday (term coming from Soviet Saturday social improvement day of some spaces). Than we have added art projects. In particular, we have made map of Ukraine, created from mosaics, that recently has been places in the Ukrainian record book. Approximately 500 people have been involved in our events. We also had some people joining from other countries and from Eastern regions of Ukraine, that at first were sceptical, yet these projects were uniting them with the community and they were thankful in the end of some sort of collaboration.</span></span>\n\n<a href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cd5f0dd093f3845a36444765597f2162e6976d24.jpg\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cd5f0dd093f3845a36444765597f2162e6976d24.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br></a>\n\n<span><span>How have you planned and initiated the development of the initiative?</span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>We have created the strategic initiative and made partnerships within urban development projects in Kiev, like \u201cPearl of Dnipro\u201d - urban construction project and \u201cReformation of Obolon embankment.

Started from scratch in 2006, it is constantly updated and enriched by a global community (over 1 million registered users). Updates happen much like in Wikipedia: anybody can make an edit and edits go live immediately. Validation of data happens in peer-to-peer mode like in Wikipedia: anyone noticing a mistake can simply edit it away, so that OSM is self-correcting..\n\nOSM is an invaluable tool in case of natural disasters, which reshape the map over minutes and hours: due to the lack of bottlenecks in the editing process, OSM can be updated much faster than any government or commercial mapping service. In the developing world there is the additional advantage that commercial services tend to produce only coarse maps, as they have no profit incentive to run full coverage of, say, Nigerian slums. OSM, on the other hand, is made by citizens and for citizens, so the inhabitants of a slum can map out their town or neighborhood with cheap equipment if they choose to do so. The importance of OSM as a disaster response tool came to the fore with the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when the whole aid community switched to use it as by far the best and most up-to-date resource for informed decision making <a href=\"http://www.gfdrr.org/sites/gfdrr.org/files/documents/Volunteer%20Technology%20Communities%20-%20Open%20Development.pdf\">[link]</a>. The same story unfolded in the aftermath of the Hayan typhoon in the Philippines, with about 700 volunteers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/15/online-volunteers-map-philippines-after-typhoon-haiyan\">making 1.5 million updates</a> to the area's map in the 48 hours after the event (at the time of writing the edits are <a href=\"http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors\">over <s>3.5</s>\u00a04.7\u00a0million and counting</a>).\n\nWe propose to use OSM as a tool for natural disaster <em>preparedness,</em> rather than response. This would mean:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>mapping on OSM the terrain itself (roads, buildings, power lines...). This creates a solid database: in case of disaster, it will need to be updated, not built from scratch. This will bring down the time needed to have a reliable post-disaster map.</li>\n\n<li>mapping resources needed for disaster response (\"Where are the shovels? Where are the coordination posts?\"). These can be encoded into specialized layers. This will enhance the ability of the stricken communities to help themselves.</li>\n\n<li>designing preparedness services \u2013 like in the Ethiopian story heard at Inno2013, which is based on geodata like gradients to determine how long it takes a flash flood to go from point A to point B.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nMapping would be carried out by the local communities themselves. OSM has, over the years, experimented with ways to bootstrap local mapping communities. The most basic exercises require just pen and paper and are very inclusive. This is critical, because it builds capacity. We have experimented them in the Italian city of Matera: a single event created from scratch a local OSM community of about 70 people that can map of which 5 are expert level \u2013 this in a city of 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nThis would create a layer of high-quality geodata that can be quickly modified to produce an up-to-date map at blinding speed in the event of a disaster, greatly facilitating relief work. As it is done by local communities, it also increases local awareness of the risks associated to flash floods and other disasters. Finally, OSM has a positive economic impact even if there is no disaster. It can serve as a platform for cheap added value services (e.g. public transport timetables, or tourism services).\n\nTo summarize, we would be up for helping you to:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>map out and connect to the OSM community in your country.</li>\n\n<li>boost it locally as needed (maybe start with a prototype in one or two places) with mapping events and capacity building. In Bangladesh the OSM community is not very strong: it is mainly concentrated in Chittagong and Dhaka, with about 30 junior contributor (&lt; 50 edits),\u00a0 no more than 5 advanced users (&lt; 500 edits) and no senior users (&gt; 500 edits). Only major roads are mapped; land use is practically 100% unmapped; roadnames are about 98% unmapped. There is clearly plenty of room for improvement.</li>\n\n<li>help it to construct natural disaster response-oriented mapping layers. We recommend doing this with light-touch guidance, letting local communities free to determine for themselves what information should be mapped. This enables local innovation, that could then be imitated elsewhere.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2013-11-22 10:05:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.856988", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 812, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28063, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2704, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Ok will do tonight</b>\n\non my way into a presentation, will look at this after.

IT ONLY EXISTS IN MY MIND AND THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE READ ABOUT IT.\n\nThat having been made clear:\n\nThe Culture is a group-civilisation formed from seven or eight humanoid species, space-living elements of which established a loose federation approximately nine thousand years ago. The ships and habitats which formed the original alliance required each others' support to pursue and maintain their independence from the political power structures - principally those of mature nation-states and autonomous commercial concerns - they had evolved from.\n\nThe galaxy (our galaxy) in the Culture stories is a place long lived-in, and scattered with a variety of life-forms. In its vast and complicated history it has seen waves of empires, federations, colonisations, die-backs, wars, species-specific dark ages, renaissances, periods of mega-structure building and destruction, and whole ages of benign indifference and malign neglect. At the time of the Culture stories, there are perhaps a few dozen major space-faring civilisations, hundreds of minor ones, tens of thousands of species who might develop space-travel, and an uncountable number who have been there, done that, and have either gone into locatable but insular retreats to contemplate who-knows-what, or disappeared from the normal universe altogether to cultivate lives even less comprehensible.\n\nIn this era, the Culture is one of the more energetic civilisations, and initially - after its formation, which was not without vicissitudes - by a chance of timing found a relatively quiet galaxy around it, in which there were various other fairly mature civilisations going about their business, traces and relics of the elder cultures scattered about the place, and - due to the fact nobody else had bothered to go wandering on a grand scale for a comparatively long time - lots of interesting 'undiscovered' star systems to explore...\n\nThe Culture, in its history and its on-going form, is an expression of the idea that the nature of space itself determines the type of civilisations which will thrive there.\n\nThe thought processes of a tribe, a clan, a country or a nation-state are essentially two-dimensional, and the nature of their power depends on the same flatness. Territory is all-important; resources, living-space, lines of communication; all are determined by the nature of the plane (that the plane is in fact a sphere is irrelevant here); that surface, and the fact the species concerned are bound to it during their evolution, determines the mind-set of a ground-living species. The mind-set of an aquatic or avian species is, of course, rather different.\n\nEssentially, the contention is that our currently dominant power systems cannot long survive in space; beyond a certain technological level a degree of anarchy is arguably inevitable and anyway preferable.\n\nTo survive in space, ships/habitats must be self-sufficient, or very nearly so; the hold of the state (or the corporation) over them therefore becomes tenuous if the desires of the inhabitants conflict significantly with the requirements of the controlling body. On a planet, enclaves can be surrounded, besieged, attacked; the superior forces of a state or corporation - hereafter referred to as hegemonies - will tend to prevail. In space, a break-away movement will be far more difficult to control, especially if significant parts of it are based on ships or mobile habitats. The hostile nature of the vacuum and the technological complexity of life support mechanisms will make such systems vulnerable to outright attack, but that, of course, would risk the total destruction of the ship/habitat, so denying its future economic contribution to whatever entity was attempting to control it.\n\nOutright destruction of rebellious ships or habitats - pour encouragez les autres - of course remains an option for the controlling power, but all the usual rules of uprising realpolitik still apply, especially that concerning the peculiar dialectic of dissent which - simply stated - dictates that in all but the most dedicatedly repressive hegemonies, if in a sizable population there are one hundred rebels, all of whom are then rounded up and killed, the number of rebels present at the end of the day is not zero, and not even one hundred, but two hundred or three hundred or more; an equation based on human nature which seems often to baffle the military and political mind. Rebellion, then (once space-going and space-living become commonplace), becomes easier than it might be on the surface of a planet.\n\nEven so, this is certainly the most vulnerable point in the time-line of the Culture's existence, the point at which it is easiest to argue for things turning out quite differently, as the extent and sophistication of the hegemony's control mechanisms - and its ability and will to repress - battles against the ingenuity, skill, solidarity and bravery of the rebellious ships and habitats, and indeed the assumption here is that this point has been reached before and the hegemony has won... but it is also assumed that - for the reasons given above - that point is bound to come round again, and while the forces of repression need to win every time, the progressive elements need only triumph once.\n\nConcomitant with this is the argument that the nature of life in space - that vulnerability, as mentioned above - would mean that while ships and habitats might more easily become independent from each other and from their legally progenitative hegemonies, their crew - or inhabitants - would always be aware of their reliance on each other, and on the technology which allowed them to live in space. The theory here is that the property and social relations of long-term space-dwelling (especially over generations) would be of a fundamentally different type compared to the norm on a planet; the mutuality of dependence involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without. This broad result is - in the long run - independent of the initial social and economic conditions which give rise to it.\n\nLet me state here a personal conviction that appears, right now, to be profoundly unfashionable; which is that a planned economy can be more productive - and more morally desirable - than one left to market forces.\n\nThe market is a good example of evolution in action; the try-everything-and-see-what- -works approach. This might provide a perfectly morally satisfactory resource-management system so long as there was absolutely no question of any sentient creature ever being treated purely as one of those resources. The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is - without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset - intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.\n\nIt is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] - through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others - a kind of synthetic evil.\n\nIntelligence, which is capable of looking farther ahead than the next aggressive mutation, can set up long-term aims and work towards them; the same amount of raw invention that bursts in all directions from the market can be - to some degree - channelled and directed, so that while the market merely shines (and the feudal gutters), the planned lases, reaching out coherently and efficiently towards agreed-on goals. What is vital for such a scheme, however, and what was always missing in the planned economies of our world's experience, is the continual, intimate and decisive participation of the mass of the citizenry in determining these goals, and designing as well as implementing the plans which should lead towards them.\n\nOf course, there is a place for serendipity and chance in any sensibly envisaged plan, and the degree to which this would affect the higher functions of a democratically designed economy would be one of the most important parameters to be set... but just as the information we have stored in our libraries and institutions has undeniably outgrown (if not outweighed) that resident in our genes, and just as we may, within a century of the invention of electronics, duplicate - through machine sentience - a process which evolution took billions of years to achieve, so we shall one day abandon the grossly targeted vagaries of the market for the precision creation of the planned economy.\n\nThe Culture, of course, has gone beyond even that, to an economy so much a part of society it is hardly worthy of a separate definition, and which is limited only by imagination, philosophy (and manners), and the idea of minimally wasteful elegance; a kind of galactic ecological awareness allied to a desire to create beauty and goodness.\n\nWhatever; in the end practice (as ever) will outshine theory.\n\nAs mentioned above, there is another force at work in the Culture aside from the nature of its human inhabitants and the limitations and opportunities presented by life in space, and that is Artificial Intelligence. This is taken for granted in the Culture stories, and - unlike FTL travel - is not only likely in the future of our own species, but probably inevitable (always assuming homo sapiens avoids destruction).\n\nCertainly there are arguments against the possibility of Artificial Intelligence, but they tend to boil down to one of three assertions: one, that there is some vital field or other presently intangible influence exclusive to biological life - perhaps even carbon-based biological life - which may eventually fall within the remit of scientific understanding but which cannot be emulated in any other form (all of which is neither impossible nor likely); two, that self-awareness resides in a supernatural soul - presumably linked to a broad-based occult system involving gods or a god, reincarnation or whatever - and which one assumes can never be understood scientifically (equally improbable, though I do write as an atheist); and, three, that matter cannot become self-aware (or more precisely that it cannot support any informational formulation which might be said to be self-aware or taken together with its material substrate exhibit the signs of self-awareness). ...I leave all the more than nominally self-aware readers to spot the logical problem with that argument.\n\nIt is, of course, entirely possible that real AIs will refuse to have anything to do with their human creators (or rather, perhaps, the human creators of their non-human creators), but assuming that they do - and the design of their software may be amenable to optimization in this regard - I would argue that it is quite possible they would agree to help further the aims of their source civilisation (a contention we'll return to shortly). At this point, regardless of whatever alterations humanity might impose on itself through genetic manipulation, humanity would no longer be a one-sentience-type species. The future of our species would affect, be affected by and coexist with the future of the AI life-forms we create.\n\nThe Culture reached this phase at around the same time as it began to inhabit space. Its AIs cooperate with the humans of the civilisation; at first the struggle is simply to survive and thrive in space; later - when the technology required to do so has become mundane - the task becomes less physical, more metaphysical, and the aims of civilisation moral rather than material.\n\nBriefly, nothing and nobody in the Culture is exploited. It is essentially an automated civilisation in its manufacturing processes, with human labour restricted to something indistinguishable from play, or a hobby.\n\nNo machine is exploited, either; the idea here being that any job can be automated in such a way as to ensure that it can be done by a machine well below the level of potential consciousness; what to us would be a stunningly sophisticated computer running a factory (for example) would be looked on by the Culture's AIs as a glorified calculator, and no more exploited than an insect is exploited when it pollinates a fruit tree a human later eats a fruit from.\n\nWhere intelligent supervision of a manufacturing or maintenance operation is required, the intellectual challenge involved (and the relative lightness of the effort required) would make such supervision rewarding and enjoyable, whether for human or machine. The precise degree of supervision required can be adjusted to a level which satisfies the demand for it arising from the nature of the civilisation's members. People - and, I'd argue, the sort of conscious machines which would happily cooperate with them - hate to feel exploited, but they also hate to feel useless. One of the most important tasks in setting up and running a stable and internally content civilisation is finding an acceptable balance between the desire for freedom of choice in one's actions (and the freedom from mortal fear in one's life) and the need to feel that even in a society so self-correctingly Utopian one is still contributing something. Philosophy matters, here, and sound education.\n\nEducation in the Culture is something that never ends; it may be at its most intense in the first tenth or so of an individual's life, but it goes on until death (another subject we'll return to). To live in the Culture is to live in a fundamentally rational civilisation (this may preclude the human species from ever achieving something similar; our history is, arguably, not encouraging in this regard). The Culture is quite self-consciously rational, sceptical, and materialist. Everything matters, and nothing does. Vast though the Culture may be - thirty trillion people, scattered fairly evenly through the galaxy - it is thinly spread, exists for now solely in this one galaxy, and has only been around for an eyeblink, compared to the life of the universe. There is life, and enjoyment, but what of it? Most matter is not animate, most that is animate is not sentient, and the ferocity of evolution pre-sentience (and, too often, post-sentience) has filled uncountable lives with pain and suffering. And even universes die, eventually. (Though we'll come back to that, too.)\n\nIn the midst of this, the average Culture person - human or machine - knows that they are lucky to be where they are when they are. Part of their education, both initially and continually, comprises the understanding that beings less fortunate - though no less intellectually or morally worthy - than themselves have suffered and, elsewhere, are still suffering. For the Culture to continue without terminal decadence, the point needs to be made, regularly, that its easy hedonism is not some ground-state of nature, but something desirable, assiduously worked for in the past, not necessarily easily attained, and requiring appreciation and maintenance both in the present and the future.\n\nAn understanding of the place the Culture occupies in the history and development of life in the galaxy is what helps drive the civilisation's largely cooperative and - it would claim - fundamentally benign techno-cultural diplomatic policy, but the ideas behind it go deeper. Philosophically, the Culture accepts, generally, that questions such as 'What is the meaning of life?' are themselves meaningless. The question implies - indeed an answer to it would demand - a moral framework beyond the only moral framework we can comprehend without resorting to superstition (and thus abandoning the moral framework informing - and symbiotic with - language itself).\n\nIn summary, we make our own meanings, whether we like it or not.\n\nThe same self-generative belief-system applies to the Culture's AIs. They are designed (by other AIs, for virtually all of the Culture's history) within very broad parameters, but those parameters do exist; Culture AIs are designed to want to live, to want to experience, to desire to understand, and to find existence and their own thought-processes in some way rewarding, even enjoyable.\n\nThe humans of the Culture, having solved all the obvious problems of their shared pasts to be free from hunger, want, disease and the fear of natural disaster and attack, would find it a slightly empty existence only and merely enjoying themselves, and so need the good-works of the Contact section to let them feel vicariously useful. For the Culture's AIs, that need to feel useful is largely replaced by the desire to experience, but as a drive it is no less strong. The universe - or at least in this era, the galaxy - is waiting there, largely unexplored (by the Culture, anyway), its physical principles and laws quite comprehensively understood but the results of fifteen billion years of the chaotically formative application and interaction of those laws still far from fully mapped and evaluated.\n\nBy Go\u00eedel out of Chaos, the galaxy is, in other words, an immensely, intrinsically, and inexhaustibly interesting place; an intellectual playground for machines that know everything except fear and what lies hidden within the next uncharted stellar system.\n\nThis is where I think one has to ask why any AI civilisation - and probably any sophisticated culture at all - would want to spread itself everywhere in the galaxy (or the universe, for that matter). It would be perfectly possible to build a Von Neumann machine that would build copies of itself and eventually, unless stopped, turn the universe into nothing but those self-copies, but the question does arise; why? What is the point? To put it in what we might still regard as frivolous terms but which the Culture would have the wisdom to take perfectly seriously, where is the fun in that?\n\nInterest - the delight in experience, in understanding - comes from the unknown; understanding is a process as well as a state, denoting the shift from the unknown to the known, from the random to the ordered... a universe where everything is already understood perfectly and where uniformity has replaced diversity, would, I'd contend, be anathema to any self-respecting AI.\n\nProbably only humans find the idea of Von Neumann machines frightening, because we half-understand - and even partially relate to - the obsessiveness of the ethos such constructs embody. An AI would think the idea mad, ludicrous and - perhaps most damning of all - boring.\n\nThis is not to say that the odd Von-Neumann-machine event doesn't crop up in the galaxy every now and again (probably by accident rather than design), but something so rampantly monomaniac is unlikely to last long pitched against beings possessed of a more rounded wit, and which really only want to alter the Von Neumann machine's software a bit and make friends...\n\nOne idea behind the Culture as it is depicted in the stories is that it has gone through cyclical stages during which there has been extensive human-machine interfacing, and other stages (sometimes coinciding with the human-machine eras) when extensive genetic alteration has been the norm. The era of the stories written so far - dating from about 1300 AD to 2100 AD - is one in which the people of the Culture have returned, probably temporarily, to something more 'classical' in terms of their relations with the machines and the potential of their own genes.\n\nThe Culture recognises, expects and incorporates fashions - albeit long-term fashions - in such matters. It can look back to times when people lived much of their lives in what we would now call cyberspace, and to eras when people chose to alter themselves or their children through genetic manipulation, producing a variety of morphological sub-species. Remnants of the various waves of such civilisational fashions can be found scattered throughout the Culture, and virtually everyone in the Culture carries the results of genetic manipulation in every cell of their body; it is arguably the most reliable signifier of Culture status.\n\nThanks to that genetic manipulation, the average Culture human will be born whole and healthy and of significantly (though not immensely) greater intelligence than their basic human genetic inheritance might imply. There are thousands of alterations to that human-basic inheritance - blister-free callusing and a clot-filter protecting the brain are two of the less important ones mentioned in the stories - but the major changes the standard Culture person would expect to be born with would include an optimized immune system and enhanced senses, freedom from inheritable diseases or defects, the ability to control their autonomic processes and nervous system (pain can, in effect, be switched off), and to survive and fully recover from wounds which would either kill or permanently mutilate without such genetic tinkering.\n\nThe vast majority of people are also born with greatly altered glands housed within their central nervous systems, usually referred to as 'drug glands'. These secrete - on command - mood- and sensory-appreciation-altering compounds into the person's bloodstream. A similar preponderance of Culture inhabitants have subtly altered reproductive organs - and control over the associated nerves - to enhance sexual pleasure. Ovulation is at will in the female, and a fetus up to a certain stage may be re-absorbed, aborted, or held at a static point in its development; again, as willed. An elaborate thought-code, self-administered in a trance-like state (or simply a consistent desire, even if not conscious) will lead, over the course of about a year, to what amounts to a viral change from one sex into the other. The convention - tradition, even - in the Culture during the time of the stories written so far is that each person should give birth to one child in their lives. In practice, the population grows slowly. (And sporadically, in addition, for other reasons, as we'll come to later.)\n\nTo us, perhaps, the idea of being able to find out what sex is like for our complimentary gender, or being able to get drunk/stoned/tripped-out or whatever just by thinking about it (and of course the Culture's drug-glands produce no unpleasant side-effects or physiological addiction) may seem like mere wish-fulfilment. And indeed it is partly wish-fulfilment, but then the fulfilment of wishes is both one of civilisation's most powerful drives and arguably one of its highest functions; we wish to live longer, we wish to live more comfortably, we wish to live with less anxiety and more enjoyment, less ignorance and more knowledge than our ancestors did... but the abilities to change sex and to alter one's brain-chemistry - without resort to external technology or any form of payment - both have more serious functions within the Culture. A society in which it is so easy to change sex will rapidly find out if it is treating one gender better than the other; within the population, over time, there will gradually be greater and greater numbers of the sex it is more rewarding to be, and so pressure for change - within society rather than the individuals - will presumably therefore build up until some form of sexual equality and hence numerical parity is established. In a similar fashion, a society in which everybody is free to, and does, choose to spend the majority of their time zonked out of their brains will know that there is something significantly wrong with reality, and (one would hope) do what it can to make that reality more appealing and less - in the pejorative sense - mundane.\n\nImplicit in the stories so far is that through self-correcting mechanisms of this nature the Culture reached a rough steady-state in such matters thousands of years ago, and has settled into a kind of long-lived civilisational main sequence which should last for the forseeable future, and thousands of generations.\n\nWhich brings us to the length of those generations, and the fact that they can be said to exist at all. Humans in the Culture normally live about three-and-a-half to four centuries. The majority of their lives consists of a three-century plateau which they reach in what we would compare to our mid-twenties, after a relatively normal pace of maturation during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. They age very slowly during those three hundred years, then begin to age more quickly, then they die.\n\nPhilosophy, again; death is regarded as part of life, and nothing, including the universe, lasts forever. It is seen as bad manners to try and pretend that death is somehow not natural; instead death is seen as giving shape to life.\n\nWhile burial, cremation and other - to us - conventional forms of body disposal are not unknown in the Culture, the most common form of funeral involves the deceased - usually surrounded by friends - being visited by a Displacement Drone, which - using the technique of near-instantaneous transmission of a remotely induced singularity via hyperspace - removes the corpse from its last resting place and deposits it in the core of the relevant system's sun, from where the component particles of the cadaver start a million-year migration to the star's surface, to shine - possibly - long after the Culture itself is history.\n\nNone of this, of course, is compulsory (nothing in the Culture is compulsory). Some people choose biological immortality; others have their personality transcribed into AIs and die happy feeling they continue to exist elsewhere; others again go into Storage, to be woken in more (or less) interesting times, or only every decade, or century, or aeon, or over exponentially increasing intervals, or only when it looks like something really different is happening...\n\nCulture starships - that is all classes of ship above inter-planetary - are sentient; their Minds (sophisticated AIs working largely in hyperspace to take advantage of the higher lightspeed there) bear the same relation to the fabric of the ship as a human brain does to the human body; the Mind is the important bit, and the rest is a life-support and transport system. Humans and independent drones (the Culture's non-android individual AIs of roughly human-equivalent intelligence) are unnecessary for the running of the starships, and have a status somewhere between passengers, pets and parasites.\n\nThe Culture's largest vessels - apart from certain art-works and a few Eccentrics - are the General Systems Vehicles of the Contact section. (Contact is the part of the Culture concerned with discovering, cataloguing, investigating, evaluating and - if thought prudent - interacting with other civilisations; its rationale and activities are covered elsewhere, in the stories.) The GSVs are fast and very large craft, measured in kilometres and inhabited by millions of people and machines. The idea behind them is that they represent the Culture, fully. All that the Culture knows, each GSV knows; anything that can be done anywhere in the Culture can be done within or by any GSV. In terms of both information and technology, they represent a last resort, and act like holographic fragments of the Culture itself, the whole contained within each part.\n\nIn our terms, the abilities of a GSV are those of - at least - a large state, and arguably a whole planet (subject only to the proviso that even the Culture prefers to scoop up matter rather than create it from nothing; GSVs do require raw material).\n\nContact is a relatively small part of the whole Culture, however, and the average Culture citizen will rarely encounter a GSV or other Contact ship in person; the craft they will normally have the most to do with are cruise ships; interstellar passenger vessels transporting people from habitat to habitat and visiting the more interesting systems, stars, nebulae, holes and so on in the locality. Again, this type of tourism is partly long-term fashion; people travel because they can, not because they have to; they could stay at home and appear to travel to exotic places through what we would now call Virtual Reality, or send an information-construct of themselves to a ship or other entity that would do the experiencing for them, and incorporate the memories themselves later.\n\nThere have been times, especially just after the relevant VR technology was perfected, when the amount of real 'physical' tourism shrank drastically, whereas during the time the stories are set (apart from during the most intense phase of the Idiran war), anything up to a tenth of the Culture's citizens might be travelling in space at any one time.\n\nPlanets figure little in the life of the average Culture person; there are a few handfuls of what are regarded as 'home' planets, and a few hundred more that were colonised (sometimes after terraforming) in the early days before the Culture proper came into being, but only a fraction of a percent of the Culture's inhabitants live on them (many more live permanently on ships). More people live in Rocks; hollowed-out asteroids and planetoids (almost all fitted with drives, and some - after nine millennia - having been fitted with dozens of different, consecutively more advanced engines). The majority, however, live in larger artificial habitats, predominantly Orbitals.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to envisage an Orbital is to compare it to the idea that inspired it (this sounds better than saying; Here's where I stole it from). If you know what a Ringworld is - invented by Larry Niven; a segment of a Dyson Sphere - then just discard the shadow-squares, shrink the whole thing till it's about three million kilometres across, and place in orbit around a suitable star, tilted just off the ecliptic; spin it to produce one gravity and that gives you an automatic 24-hour day-night cycle (roughly; the Culture's day is actually a bit longer). An elliptical orbit provides seasons.\n\nOf course, the materials used in the construction of something ten million kilometres in circumference spinning once every 24 hours are far beyond anything we can realistically imagine now, and it is quite possible that the physical constraints imposed by the strength of atomic bonds ensure that such structures will prove impossible to construct, but if it is possible to build on a such a scale and subject such structures to forces of these magnitudes, then I'd submit that there is an elegance in using the same rotation to produce both an acceptable day-night cycle and an apparent gravity which makes the idea intrinsically attractive.\n\nUsually, rather than construct whole Orbitals in one operation, the Culture starts with Plates; a pair of slabs of land and water (plus full retaining walls, of course) of not less than a thousand kilometres to a side, spinning in a similar orbit, attached by tensor fields to each other, and behaving like sections of a completed Orbital; this variation provides greater flexibility when responding to population increase. Further plate-pairs can then be added until the Orbital is complete.\n\nThe attraction of Orbitals is their matter efficiency. For one planet the size of Earth (population 6 billion at the moment; mass 6x1024 kg), it would be possible, using the same amount of matter, to build 1,500 full orbitals, each one boasting a surface area twenty times that of Earth and eventually holding a maximum population of perhaps 50 billion people (the Culture would regard Earth at present as over-crowded by a factor of about two, though it would consider the land-to-water ratio about right). Not, of course, that the Culture would do anything as delinquent as actually deconstructing a planet to make Orbitals; simply removing the sort of wandering debris (for example comets and asteroids) which the average solar system comes equipped with and which would threaten such an artificial world's integrity through collision almost always in itself provides sufficient material for the construction of at least one full Orbital (a trade-off whose conservatory elegance is almost blissfully appealing to the average Mind), while interstellar matter in the form of dust clouds, brown dwarfs and the like provides more distant mining sites from which the amount of mass required for several complete Orbitals may be removed with negligible effect.\n\nWhatever the source material, Orbitals are obviously far more mass-efficient in providing living space than planets. The Culture, as is made clear in Use of Weapons, regards terraforming generally as ecologically unsound; the wilderness should be left as it is, when it is so easy to build paradise in space from so little.\n\nAn idea of how the day-night cycle appears on the surface of an Orbital can be gained by taking an ordinary belt, buckling it so that it forms a circle, and putting your eye to the outside of one of the belt's holes; looking through the hole at a light bulb and slowly rotating the whole belt will give some idea of how a star appears to move across the sky when seen from an Orbital, though it will also leave you looking rather silly.\n\nAs indicated, the usual minimum for the width of an Orbital is about a thousand kilometres (two thousand if you count the sloped, mostly transparent retaining walls, which usually extend to five hundred kilometres or so above the plate land-sea surface). The normal ratio of land to sea is 1:3, so that on each Plate - assuming they are being constructed in the balanced pairs described above - a (very) roughly square island rests in the middle of a sea, with approximately two hundred and fifty kilometres from the shore of the land mass to the retaining walls. Orbitals, though, like everything else in the Culture, vary enormously.\n\nOne thing almost every Orbital - whether just two Plates or a completed (\"closed\") Orbital - does have, is a Hub. As its name implies, the Hub sits in the centre of the Orbital, equidistant from all parts of the main circumferential structure (but not physically joined to it, normally). The Hub is where the Orbital's controlling AI (often a Mind) usually exists, running, or helping to run, the Orbital's transport, manufacturing, maintenance and subsidiary systems, acting as switchboard for trans-Orbital communications, library and general information point, traffic control for approaching, departing and close-passing ships, and generally working as the Orbital's principle link with the rest of the Culture. During the construction phase of a Plate-pair, the Hub will normally control the process.\n\nThe design of a Plate sometimes incorporates the deep - or strategic - structure of the surface geography, so that the Plate medium itself contains the corrugations that will become mountains, valleys and lakes; more commonly, the Plate surface is left flat and the strategic structures on the inner surface - also constructed from Plate base material - are added later. Under either method, the Plate's manufacturing and maintenance systems are located within the indentations or hollows of the strategic structure, leaving the land surface free to assume a rural appearance, once the tactical geomorphology has been designed and positioned, the Plate's complement of water and air has been emplaced, the necessary weathering has occurred, and the relevant flora and fauna have been introduced.\n\nThe surface of the Plate base is pierced by multitudinous shafts allowing access to the factory and maintenance volumes, and to the sub-surface transport systems. (Almost invariably, these include restricted single-aperture concentrically rotating airlocks paired in sequence.)\n\nExisting on the outer surface of the base material, an Orbital's rapid-transport systems operate in vacuum, with the resulting advantages the lack of air-resistance confers; the relatively uncluttered nature of the Orbital's outer surface (whether flat, allowing the systems to operate next to that surface, or corrugated, requiring sling-bridges under unoccupied mountain indentations), means that the systems can be both high-capacity and extremely flexible. Journey starting-points and destinations can be highly specific for the same reason; an isolated house or a small village will have its own access shaft, and in larger conurbations a shaft will usually be within a few minutes walk.\n\nSurface transport on Orbitals tends to be used when the pleasure of making the journey is itself part of the reason for travelling; air travel is common enough (if still far slower than sub-surface travel), though individual Plates often have their own guide-lines concerning the amount of air travel thought appropriate. Such guide-lines are part of one's manners, and not formalised in anything as crude as laws.\n\nThe Culture doesn't actually have laws; there are, of course, agreed-on forms of behaviour; manners, as mentioned above, but nothing that we would recognise as a legal framework. Not being spoken to, not being invited to parties, finding sarcastic anonymous articles and stories about yourself in the information network; these are the normal forms of manner-enforcement in the Culture. The very worst crime (to use our terminology), of course, is murder (defined as irretrievable brain-death, or total personality loss in the case of an AI). The result - punishment, if you will - is the offer of treatment, and what is known as a slap-drone. All a slap-drone does is follow the murderer around for the rest of their life to make sure they never murder again. There are less severe variations on this theme to deal with people who are simply violent.\n\nIn a society where material scarcity is unknown and the only real value is sentimental value, there is little motive or opportunity for the sort of action we would class as a crime against property.\n\nMegalomaniacs are not unknown in the Culture, but they tend to be diverted successfully into highly complicated games; there are entire Orbitals where some of these philosophically crude Obsessive games are played, though most are in Virtual Reality. Something of a status-symbol for the determined megalomaniac is having one's own starship; this is considered wasteful by most people, and is also futile, if the purpose of having it is to escape the Culture completely and - say - set up oneself up as God or Emperor on some backward planet; the person might be free to pilot their (obviously non-AI controlled) ship, and even approach a planet, but the Contact section is equally free to follow that person wherever they go and do whatever it thinks appropriate to stop him or her from doing anything injurious or unpleasant to whatever civilisations they come into - or attempt to come into - contact with. This tends to be frustrating, and Virtual Reality games - up to and including utter-involvement level, in which the player has to make a real and sustained effort to return to the real world, and can even forget that it exists entirely - are far more satisfying.\n\nSome people, however, refuse this escape-route too, and leave the Culture altogether for a civilisation that suits them better and where they can operate in a system which gives them the kind of rewards they seek. To renounce the Culture so is to lose access to its technology though, and, again, Contact supervises the entry of such people into their chosen civilisation at a level which guarantees they aren't starting with too great an advantage compared to the original inhabitants (and retains the option of interfering, if it sees fit).\n\nA few such apparently anti-social people are even used by Contact itself, especially by the Special Circumstances section.\n\nThe way the Culture creates AIs means that a small number of them suffer from similar personality problems; such machines are given the choice of cooperative re-design, a more limited role in the Culture than they might have had otherwise, or a similarly constrained exile.\n\nPolitics in the Culture consists of referenda on issues whenever they are raised; generally, anyone may propose a ballot on any issue at any time; all citizens have one vote. Where issues concern some sub-division or part of a total habitat, all those - human and machine - who may reasonably claim to be affected by the outcome of a poll may cast a vote. Opinions are expressed and positions on issues outlined mostly via the information network (freely available, naturally), and it is here that an individual may exercise the most personal influence, given that the decisions reached as a result of those votes are usually implemented and monitored through a Hub or other supervisory machine, with humans acting (usually on a rota basis) more as liaison officers than in any sort of decision-making executive capacity; one of the few rules the Culture adheres to with any exactitude at all is that a person's access to power should be in inverse proportion to their desire for it. The sad fact for the aspiring politico in the Culture is that the levers of power are extremely widely distributed, and very short (see entry on megalomaniacs, above). The intellectual-structural cohesion of a starship of course limits the sort of viable votes possible on such vessels, though as a rule even the most arrogant craft at least pretend to listen when their guests suggest - say - making a detour to watch a supernova, or increasing the area of parkland on-board.\n\nDay-to-day life in the Culture varies considerably from place to place, but there is a general stability about it we might find either extremely peaceful or ultimately rather disappointing, depending on our individual temperament. We, after all, are used to living in times of great change; we expect major technological developments and have learned to adapt - indeed expect to have to adapt on a more or less continual basis, changing (in the developed world) our cars, our entertainment systems and a whole variety of household objects every few years. In contrast, the Culture builds to last; it is not uncommon for an aircraft, for example, to be handed down through several generations. Important technological advances still take place, but they don't tend to affect day-to-day life the way that the invention of the internal combustion engine, heavier-than-air flying machines and electronics have affected the lives of those who have lived during the past century on Earth. Even the relative homogeneity of the people one would meet when living on the average Orbital - with relatively few children and physically old people - would tend, for us, to reinforce the feeling of sameness, though the scattering of genetically altered, morphologically extreme people around would help compensate for this.\n\nIn terms of personal relations and family groupings, the Culture is, predictably, full of every possible permutation and possibility, but the most common life-style consists of groups of people of mixed generations linked by loose family ties living in a semi-communal dwelling or group of dwellings; to be a child in the Culture is to have a mother, perhaps a father, probably not a brother or sister, but large numbers of aunts and uncles, and various cousins. Usually, a mother will avoid changing sex during the first few years of a child's life. (Though, of course, if you want to confuse your child...) In the rare event of a parent maltreating a child (a definition which includes depriving the child of the opportunity for education) it is considered acceptable for people close to them - usually with the help of the relevant Mind, ship or Hub AI, and subject to the sort of small-scale democratic process outlined above - to supervise the child's subsequent development.\n\nIn general the Culture doesn't actively encourage immigration; it looks too much like a disguised form of colonialism. Contact's preferred methods are intended to help other civilisations develop their own potential as a whole, and are designed to neither leech away their best and brightest, nor turn such civilisations into miniature versions of the Culture. Individuals, groups and even whole lesser civilisations do become part of the Culture on occasion, however, if there seems to be a particularly good reason (and if Contact reckons it won't upset any other interested parties in the locality).\n\nJust who and what is and isn't Culture is something of a difficult question to answer though; as has been said in one of the books, the Culture kind of fades out at the edges. There are still fragments - millions of ships, hundreds of Orbitals, whole systems - of the Peace faction of the Culture, which split from the main section just before the start of the Idiran War, when ships and habitats voted independently on the need to go to war at all; the minority simply declared itself neutral in the hostilities and the re-integration of the Peace faction after the cessation of hostilities was never totally completed, many people in it preferring to stay outside the majority Culture as long as it did not renounce the future use of force.\n\nThe genofixing which established the potential for inter-species breeding at the foundation of the Culture is the most obvious indicator of what we might call Culture-hood in humans, but not everybody has it; some people prefer to be more human-basic for aesthetic or philosophical reasons, while some are so altered from that human-basic state that any interbreeding is impossible. The status of some of the Rocks and a few (mostly very old) habitats is marginal for a variety of reasons.\n\nContact is the most coherent and consistent part of the Culture - certainly when considered on a galactic scale - yet it is only a very small part of it, is almost a civilisation within a civilisation, and no more typifies its host than an armed service does a peaceful state. Even the Cultures's prized language, Marain, is not spoken by every Culture person, and is used well outside the limits of the civilisation itself.\n\nNames; Culture names act as an address if the person concerned stays where they were brought up. Let's take an example; Balveda, from Consider Phlebas. Her full name is Juboal-Rabaroansa Perosteck Alseyn Balveda dam T'seif. The first part tells you she was born/brought up on Rabaroan Plate, in the Juboal stellar system (where there is only one Orbital in a system, the first part of a name will often be the name of the Orbital rather than the star); Perosteck is her given name (almost invariably the choice of one's mother), Alseyn is her chosen name (people usually choose their names in their teens, and sometimes have a succession through their lives; an alseyn is a graceful but fierce avian raptor common to many Orbitals in the region which includes the Juboal system); Balveda is her family name (usually one's mother's family name) and T'seif is the house/estate she was raised within. The 'sa' affix on the first part of her name would translate into 'er' in English (we might all start our names with 'Sun-Earther', in English, if we were to adopt the same nomenclature), and the 'dam' part is similar to the German 'von'. Of course, not everyone follows this naming-system, but most do, and the Culture tries to ensure that star and Orbital names are unique, to avoid confusion.\n\nNow, in all the above, there are two untold stories implicit. One is the history of the Culture's formation, which was a lot less easy and more troubled than its later demeanour might lead one to expect, and the other is the story which answers the question; why were there all those so-similar humanoid species scattered around the galaxy in the first place?\n\nEach story is too complicated to relate here.\n\nLastly, something of the totally fake cosmology that underpins the shakily credible stardrives mentioned in the Culture stories. Even if you can accept all the above, featuring a humanoid species that seems to exhibit no real greed, paranoia, stupidity, fanaticism or bigotry, wait till you read this...\n\nWe accept that the three dimensions of space we live in are curved, that space-time describes a hypersphere, just as the two dimensions of length and width on the surface of a totally smooth planet curve in a third dimension to produce a three-dimensional sphere. In the Culture stories, the idea is that - when you imagine the hypersphere which is our expanding universe - rather than thinking of a growing hollow sphere (like a inflating beach-ball, for example), think of an onion.\n\nAn expanding onion, certainly, but an onion, nevertheless. Within our universe, our hypersphere, there are whole layers of younger, smaller hyperspheres. And we are not the very outer-most skin of that expanding onion, either; there are older, larger universes beyond ours, too. Between each universe there is something called the Energy Grid (I said this was all fake); I have no idea what this is, but it's what the Culture starships run on. And of course, if you could get through the Energy Grid, to a younger universe, and then repeat the process... now we really are talking about immortality. (This is why there are two types of hyperspace mentioned in the stories; infraspace within our hypersphere, and ultraspace without.)\n\nNow comes the difficult bit; switch to seven dimensions and even our four dimensional universe can be described as a circle. So forget about the onion; think of a doughnut. A doughnut with only a very tiny hole in the middle. That hole is the Cosmic Centre, the singularity, the great initiating fireball, the place the universes come from; and it didn't exist just in the instant our universe came into being; it exists all the time, and it's exploding all the time, like some Cosmic car engine, producing universes like exhaust smoke.\n\nAs each universe comes into being, detonating and spreading and expanding, it - or rather the single circle we are using to describe it - goes gradually up the inner slope of our doughnut, like a widening ripple from a stone flung in a pond. It goes over the top of the doughnut, reaches its furthest extent on the outside edge of the doughnut, and then starts the long, contracting, collapsing journey back in towards the Cosmic Centre again, to be reborn...\n\nOr at least it does if it's on that doughnut; the doughnut is itself hollow, filled with smaller ones where the universes don't live so long. And there are larger ones outside it, where the universes live longer, and maybe there are universes that aren't on doughnuts at all, and never fall back in, and just dissipate out into... some form of meta-space? Where fragments of them are captured eventually by the attraction of another doughnut, and fall in towards its Cosmic Centre with the debris of lots of other dissipated universes, to be reborn as something quite different again? Who knows. (I know it's all nonsense, but you've got to admit it's impressive nonsense. And like I said at the start, none of it exists anyway, does it?)\n\nAnyway, that's more than enough of me pontificating.\n\nWith best wishes for the future,\n\nIain M Banks\n\n(Sun-Earther Iain El-Bonko Banks of North Queensferry)\n\nThis article was posted to newsgroup rec.arts.sf.written on 10 Aug 1994 on behalf of Iain M Banks by Ken MacLeod kenm@festival.ed.ac.uk.\n\nCopyright 1994 Iain M Banks\n\nCommercial use only by permission.\n\nOther uses, distribution, reproduction, tearing to shreds etc are freely encouraged provided the source is acknowledged\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-25 23:47:08", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 16:35:21.231304", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8828, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3498, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 3465, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong><a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0and Vinay \"<a href=\"/u/hexayurt\">@hexayurt</a>\" Gupta\u00a0will be visiting Belarus August 10 - August 16 2014 to support UNDP.

The very factors that gave us our nimble ability to pull a little money and spin it out into a substantial project strong enough to stand on its own feet as an independent enterprise also meant that we had to \"make do and mend.\" <strong>That has meant a lot of working with what we have, and like most people, what we have are friends.</strong>\n\nWe have an open network, but its centres of gravity are heavily influenced by the early make-up of the group, and what projects come in. Open to everybody, but most of the people who come are socially connected. While we are well aware of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter#The_strength_of_weak_ties\">the strength of weak ties</a>\" our practice is incremental and in phases: we strive to do more. Always.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BuRl87rIUAEef15.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 528px;\">\n\n<em>EdgeRyders network activity during Spot The Future - note our hubs in Egypt, Georgia and Armenia - that's us growing, learning, and adapting!</em>\n\nUNDP is a very different kind of organization. It has a global mandate, and very strong expectations are placed upon it to provide appropriate services all over the world. UNDP is a very good example of the kind of institution that we expect to be fully representative and to fulfil its mandates with the same level \u00a0provision all over the world, scaled to local needs. Rather than being able to work to its strengths and work out, <strong>UNDP's budget comes with the necessity to get strong where it is weak so that everybody can lean on it to roughly the same degree</strong>: as always this is a work in progress, nothing is ever finished, but the intention is there to do the job right, and do it locally in a manner that reflects a global mandate and global resources.\n\nEdgeRyders and UNDP have been collaborating on a project called <a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-team-coordination-space/365\">Spot the Future</a>. It focused on identifying strengths which might otherwise be missed: new ideas, networks, areas of unexpected consensus, cohesion and cooperation through demographic and ethnographic analysis. <strong>After a very successful series of events in Egypt, Georgia and Armenia the next stop is Belarus</strong>. Alberto Cottica and I will be visiting UNDP in Belarus for a week from August 10 2014, extending Spot the Future, bringing the experiences we have gathered so far, and learning about a new country, a new culture and new communities as we extend our collaboration with UNDP.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/RvhhuJgHPDw?rel=0\n\n<em>Spot The Future!</em>\n\n<strong>These kinds of collaborations, between entities of very different sizes with very different strengths can be overwhelmingly productive</strong>. Our culture and mythology are full of stories about how different people with radically different skills can work together to great effect. There must be any number of fairy tales or science fiction stories about how the unique strengths of very different kinds of people can contribute to the greater good. Princes and beggars, wizards and apprentice blacksmiths, frogs and princesses. But in practice most of our working lives are spent working with people and institutions are are a lot like us: big orgs work with big orgs, or slightly smaller orgs which provide an interface to yet smaller orgs, and finally down to the individual. <strong>In these tiers, a lot of the shock of discovery, the \"shock of the new\", can be washed out or filtered through the monitoring and reporting processes</strong>.\n\n\"Spot The Future\" and the EdgeRyders approach in general are rooted in deep peer collaboration. We do not ask everybody to put down their organizational role at the door: if we did that, many people could not bring their full strength and support to the process. But we do ask people to come first as human beings, as well-intentioned citizens with a role, a job, some resources, and concerns both personal and professional. A process of open collaboration brings the perspective and individual insight of each person in the room into clear, even, equal focus, and from that emerges a strong sense of what is shared: what we have in common, across all levels and organizations. This brings new possibilities for harmonious cooperation and mutual engagement to the fore. As a process it owes much to the human values established in projects around intercultural understanding, and intellectual styles like interdisciplinary research.\n\nAs we have learned from our partnership with UNDP in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia, the approaches which grew out of our earlier work which was mainly grounded in Western Europe work well for people from different cultures. Perhaps because of the rooting in a basically social, face-to-face collaboration, <strong>cultural differences express not as barriers, but as additional richness and insight emerging as new perspective enriches our experience</strong>.\n\nBelarus is another culture, another extension of our partnership with UNDP, a truly global organization, into a place which is outside the experience of EdgeRyders alone. We look forwards to meeting, learning and experiencing, and we sincerely hope that our peers in Belarus find the experience enriching too.\n\nWe'll see you next week!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-06 13:21:08", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 23:46:41.873947", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1040, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18861, "user_id": 903, "topic_id": 1496, "post_number": 8, "raw": "That's an interesting comment I hadn't thought of Chris\u2014when you do lots of edge-y stuff that just sort of cobbles together enough money to live on it's hard to explain what you really do.

Not surprisingly, I also started out with a \"bucky design\" (I worked on Fullerenes, one my friend's kids is called Buckminster). I met a bunch of architects \"haggling over his legacy\" at an event. But they were almost all \"duck architecture\" people. I am not. So I set out to think this through on my own. One motivation was the rent part, the other was to have an adaptable building that could \"age with me\", move to the people I want to spend my time with, and can be split up or passed onto my descendents. That way it would also make sense to keep investing in high quality durable goods. My assumption was that I'd probably move long distances (so containers made sense) and not terribly often (5-10 more times), so it may be a bit on the clunky side of considerations. I think I even made a rough calc of basic features and cost to move. Set up will be too dependent on details with the size I had in mind.\n\nThe problem is now relatively moot for me as I have changed career path out of the pretty overrun elite center, to somewhere else. And basically there is a lot of housing to go around for everyone (exceptions apply) then. People just won't let you in to keep the prices high and the market looking good. That reminds me that I have a architect and a city planner friend in Vienna whom support my perception here. So in my case there <em>would </em>be a policy fix - and I could just go to <em>reuse</em> and wouldn't have to build (admittedly kind of lame). If you want to have a chat with them or ask a couple of questions (with some context) I can probably arrange it. They \"get it\" already, you won't have to explain too much.\n\nOkay now why did I move away from the dome?\n\nA couple of reasons. Mostly because of simplicity. Manufacturing triangles needs extra cuts. Each lap (especially \"funny angles\") makes things more complicated, expensive and failure prone. Especially where the points meet and you get coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch, rot, and whatnot. Sure there's smarter and dumber ways to tackle all that - but it ain't easy. All that can be outweighed by a more efficient overall design of course (hi Bucky). But is it? Well if I want to make my furniture and wallpaper out of polygons, perhaps. Otherwise I'd be happy to have a couple of roughly perpendicular walls. The hexayurt fixes that, and your concept apparently too. But if you now draw some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RmDa5HmI4M\">roof overhang</a> (which we both totally should have in our concepts), it looks an awful lot like a regular small house. But in your house the wall has to perform two tasks - it has to hold up the roof (compressive stress) and it does the insulation, at the same time. In my concept the packing container has two tasks: either be a mobile container - and at another time, \"only\" take up the compressive stresses of the roof and walls, and whatnot. But that is not a hard job for a container (you can stack them 7 high - filled). The problem is of course that the container insulates about as good as a frying pan ( = 0). So the insulation is done by another set of walls (the <a href=\"http://www.klimah%C3%BClle.info/?page_id=26\">klimah\u00fclle, in effect = greenhouse</a>), which does not have to support its own weight. Thus I can go real light on materials (they are under no compressive stress) and achieve far superior insulation at the same time (because the insulating elements are the pockets of air trapped in the material, any material is worse than no material). It still has to deal with wind loads though. And because I have very little thermal mass (no big walls, just a very few tons of steel) I really need to monitor and manage heat (and moisture). That can be done by shading off (or reflecting in additional) sunlight. If I end up needing more thermal mass I would put in a couple of tons of water + heat exchanger (can nicely be coupled to the steel containers). Finally I expect something not working, or a couple of extreme temperature days - for that I'd put in a smallish room in a room, so you don't have to heat the whole place.\n\nIf you are frugal you can probably break the concept down to a 1-2 container version - but the ratio of transport volume to necessary wall+roof (or membrane) area gets more challenging the smaller you go.

To get a less filtered view of the event, check out the \\#knwlb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23knwlb&amp;src=typd\">Twitter stream</a>.\n\nIn this piece, I\u2019m going to very briefly summarize what I learned about the practice of foresight and futures studies (roughly interchangeable terms), share some thoughts about what it means to \u201cuse the future\u201d (a key theme of the convening), and ask, essentially, \u201cwho is foresight for?\u201d Or, in other word, Who can use the future? In a follow up note, I will share some resources I gathered at the event to put the idea of \u201cforesight\u201d into practical perspective, in case readers would like to use the future, too.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">What is foresight?</h2>\n\n<em>Foresight is a practice in search of a theory. \u2013 overheard at Knowlab </em>\n\nForty days ago, I had not heard of \u201cforesight\u201d as a profession or community of practice, which means that anything I have to say about it has both the benefit and handicap of a newcomer\u2019s perspective. I was somewhat relieved to learn I hadn\u2019t missed something obvious in my work to date when I read in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresight_\">Wikipedia article on foresight</a> (futures_studies) that it is a practice that has played out largely in European governance and civil society (I am based in the US). But foresight has become a global pursuit. At the event, I learned that a major university in Taiwan (I believe <a href=\"http://www2.tku.edu.tw/~tddx/en/1-4.htm\">Tamkang University</a> ) requires all of its students to take a course in futures studies \u2013 which means that the discipline has been incorporated into the higher education of 80,000 people in that region. One participant informed me that there are roughly 1,000 active foresight professionals worldwide.\n\nFor others new to foresight, I think it is helpful to point out that practitioners define their work in contrast to the predictions made by \u201cpop futurists\u201d (think <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/future-that-never-was-next-gen-tech-concepts#slide-1\">Popular Mechanics</a>  or <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/01/2013-the-way-we-were/\">Wired magazine</a> ). In fact, that is why you will almost always see the word \u201cfutures\u201d in its plural form when interacting with the field.\n\nThe construction of multiple scenarios is a key method in foresight.I learned to think of foresight work as reverse engineering long-term planning and policy decisions using multiple, divergent potential futures as starting points. The promise that this approach can lead to more adaptive, resilient policy processes suited for a increasingly unpredictable world is a consistent theme in the foresight field. Foresight embraces and attempts to operationalize (or make useful) lessons learned from complexity science and systems theory, using both quantitative and qualitative social science methods. It is possible the field lacks a unifying theory, but that is likely a consequence of the fact that futures methods are usually applied in policy and institutional planning.  \n\nOne of the simplest explanations I received during the event is that foresight makes explicit often implicit assumptions along the dimensions of:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Plausible futures based on what we know about current systems.</li>\n\n<li>Probable futures derived from known current trends of change.</li>\n\n<li>Possible futures concerned with low-probability, high impact events (aka \u201cblack swans [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory]).</li>\n\n<li>Preferable futures which introduce a wider scope of choice and human agency in creating best possible outcomes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn my own work exploring the <a href=\"http://philanthrogeek.com\">innovative edge of philanthropy</a>, I have seen a pattern where the plausible and the probable become enemies of the preferable when discussing the field\u2019s potential for change. In other words, \u201cwell that\u2019s not very likely to happen\u201d becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that limits the range of design for excellence. So I felt that I had met some fellow travelers at Knowlab when I discovered that most of the energy and excitement of the field has to do with generating preferable futures.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/457ef73f3594df116525a27d6824a290dda9ba5d.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"416\"><br>\n\n<em>Image source: [Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ro7dVInkrg5J5ZTTK8w_DGOf_SXG2DJT), by Jessica Bland and Stian Westlake</em>\n\n \n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Using the future?</h2>\n\nThe key organizer of Knowlab, Riel Miller of UNESCO, wants more people and institutions to \u201cuse the future\u201d in creating collective decisions today. At first, I wrestled with this phrase, \u201cuse the future.\u201d Does \u201cthe future\u201d exist? If the future exists, it is ephemeral, uncertain by definition, and highly contested. Meanwhile, most people are struggling to prepare for very immediate futures in daily, weekly, quarterly, or sometimes annual time frames. It was difficult for me to imagine anything so far out of touch being of much use to anyone.  \n\nNot so long ago conceptual frameworks like complexity science or \u201cdesign thinking\u201d were arcane terms, but more recently their influence is being felt in many areas. The conceptual leap I had to make to understand \u201cusing the future\u201d is that futures exist in our individual and collective imaginations. Anticipation is a deeply human trait, and our anticipations for the future, both long and short-term, inform our daily decisions by shaping our understanding of the range of possibilities before us. In some sense, those futures use us. Riel and his colleagues are offering a \u201cdiscipline of anticipation\u201d to create greater moments of agency and choice as we enter uncertain times.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Who is foresight for?</h2>\n\nSetting my deeper questions aside, it is clear that some people are using the future already. And those people tend to lead large, well-financed institutions that make policy decisions that affect the lives of millions. UNESCO, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the JRC are just a few examples of institutions invested in using the field of foresight in their planning and decision processes.\n\nIt is clear to me that foresight practitioners working with influential institutions are aware of and concerned about the bias an institution\u2019s agenda can introduce into a foresight process. The idea that the future can be a \u201csafe place for reflection and exploration\u201d was a common theme at the event and in the literature I have scanned since. However, I get a sense that this often translates into safe places for institutional staff and advisors to explore the possible and the preferable freed from the day-to-day politics and bureaucratic constraints of their organizations.\n\nI learned of several cases where such institutions attempted to convene diverse participants into their processes. However, I get the sense that this often means \u201cdiverse experts\u201d or that participants are identified and recruited by experts. The institutional allegiance to \u201cexpertise\u201d can introduce its own set of biases, and spaces controlled by large institutions and their circle of advisors may or may not be perceived as \u201csafe\u201d by any number of people whose input would generate value.\n\nExpertise is a problematic construction in a networked world. First of all, the rapid pace of change calls established expertise into constant question. Knowledge is so widely available that it can be acquired and utilized without institutional credentials or recognition. Additionally, networked individuals and \u201csmall groups\u201d can now have the kind of influence in shaping the future that was once only attainable by incorporated organizations controlling large resource pools, introducing a new element of chaos and unpredictability into the system, while simultaneously generating new areas of knowledge and expertise \u201con the ground\u201d where geopolitical and economic changes are experienced first hand.\n\nSo, can anyone use the future or do foresight exercises need to originate from foresight professionals? Can foresight professionals share their tools and democratize the practice? Are they willing to lose some \u201cownership\u201d of the practice, and are they open to seeing what can happen with futures imagined at the grassroots level? In any case, who is the primary beneficiary of foresight activities? If futurists want more people to \u201cuse the future,\u201d it is incumbent upon them to articulate the value of their practices. As someone who has incorporated elements of foresight (systems theory, the power of narrative, etc.) into my work without being aware of the field of foresight and future, I am convinced that there is enormous value here. But how does it translate into a broader network of new practitioners and how do those translations return and inform the professional field?\n\nMeanwhile, I would argue that leaders and networks outside of the field of professional foresight have been using the future quite successfully. <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\">Edgeryders</a> is one example. A colleague of mine, <a href=\"http://blog.art21.org/2014/06/24/black-futurism-the-creative-destruction-and-reconstruction-of-race-in-contemporary-art/#.VBeMkEvLhG5\">Nettrice Gaskins</a>, is incorporating frameworks of Afrofuturism and black futurism into art criticism and integrating what she\u2019s learning into Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) training for young people often marginalized by traditional educational practices. I also think about <a href=\"https://alliedmedia.org\">Allied Media Projects</a>, which has been convening grassroots change makers for sixteen years to leverage media and technology for social change. In recent years, AMP has taken an explicitly futurist turn, incorporating science fiction motifs and exercises to re-imagine the future of Detroit (its home base) from a technologically empowered grassroots up. In re-imagining Detroit, AMP is opening new spaces for the futures of all post-industrial cities and connecting with global participants.\n\nIn other words, the future is not the sole domain of the full-time futurists. If there is a shared goal for more people to use the future, I hope the foresight field will take a broader view of where futures expertise lives. I believe there is a lot of potential in sharing what has been learned in formal futures and foresight settings, but conversely a lot for the field to learn from those who are actively embracing and creating futures, but may be too involved in that creation to date to have connected with the formal networks of the futures field. The future is potential. I only hope that potential is universally accessible and useful.", "created_at": "2014-09-16 04:40:31", "updated_at": "2018-04-13 17:55:54.580047", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1804, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 60.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21416, "user_id": 2623, "topic_id": 4420, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>fain</b>\n\nFoarte fain, as veni si eu.

It paints Arthur as unhinged and immature, it cheapens any conciliatory or constructive statements you make, and whether you feel that way about Arthur or not, <strong>it is simply not helpful to mention it</strong>. It's not helpful for the discussion, it's not helpful for Arthur, and it's not helpful for the community perception of you or Edgeryders LBG.\n\n\"<em>What would you suggest as an appropriate reaction to allegations you have committed a criminal offense?</em>\"\n\n1) A statement of your innocence, and the evidence for that innocence.\n\n2) nothing more.\n\nBoth you and <a href=\"/u/patrick_andrews\">@Patrick_Andrews</a> have, in my eyes, adequately provided 1), but failed miserably at 2).\n\n\"<em>do you not think your own gut reaction should have been to ask everyone to stand down and go back to civil interaction?</em>\"\n\nI think that everyone should avoid escalating conflict and making personal attacks'. If disagreements and discussions can be held in a constructive way, then people shouldn't stand down, those discussions should absolutely take place. I never supported or condoned Arthur's position. But it seemed to me from the comments that Arthur is not going to have much to do with ER LBG from here on, whereas Patrick will be taking a leading role. His first interaction with a community member since taking on the role was being challenged and accused of wrongdoing. This is tough, but it's particularly important to be able to rise above personal remarks and lead by example, especially at a time when the relationship between ER LBG and the ER community is so sensitive.\n\nMy intention (and I think this was clear to most observers) was not to pick sides, or to suggest that only one person's language was inappropriate, and everything else was fine. I don't have a horse in this race. But it's going to take some time for Patrick to grow into his role, and I wanted to remind him of the importance of his position and his relationship with the ER community, and urge more care in online interactions, even when the conduct of those he is interacting with may leave a lot to be desired.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 15:29:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.057845", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 582, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27518], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2297, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2264, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Last November the Edgeryders community reached two years old and 1700 registered platform users.

Members can use Edgeryders web home to put up posts whenever and wherever, to set up and manage their project group, reach out to others for help and use the infrastructure the way they see fit. Specific tasks and conversations around them often need to make sense only to those collaborating. It was with that healthy dose of chaos &amp; empowerment that our true potential to work together in a distributed way came about. A year of building the unMonastery and five months of organizing Living on the Edge 3 (not to mention weekly community calls!) prove that.\n\nHowever, as membership and number of projects keep growing, one of the challenges I perceive is keeping the\u00a0flag up for everyone to see, especially new members looking for spots to get involved, older members who got lost on the way and are waiting for a chance to jump back in, anyone whose work could benefit greatly from collaborating.

From the community theory\u2019s perspective, asking people to do things which are not individualized and don\u2019t come with individual rewards will hardly end up in engagement.\n\n<strong>So what is the individual reward?</strong> Why should you fill it in? The way it goes is: you share your thoughts on what you want Edgeryders to achieve (think big!) -&gt; you hack with others the responses -&gt; you <em>are</em> Edgeryders moving forward and part of a world changing organization where everyone gets to do work they love, the way they see fit and\u00a0with the people they want to do it with.

Independently of KITE, a lot of reporting has to be done locally by the people working (and spending the money)...</span>\n\nConcerning the creation of an \"ethics\" WP, both pro and contra are true. There is no general rule there, even in strictly \"health\" proposals, and it depends on the narrative associated to the structure. In my most recent experience, the consultancy firm which was assisting us in wrapping up the proposal recommended that we split the activities in WPs rather fine-grainedly, with the purpose of making it clear to the reviewers what activities were run. They then forced us through the exercise of drawing two schemes:\n\n1) \"intellectual\", showing how the WPs could be framed in technical pillars (sort of sub-projects, if you may)\n\n2) \"logical\", describing the information exchange and workflow, turning those WPs in one functioning ecosystem.\n\nUnity and multidisciplinary nature would then be highlighted by the parts of the proposal \u00a0describing the project architecture and coordination, and the consortium composition.\n\nI would like to stress that the exercise \\#1 could be handy in thinking of bootstrapping over alternative funding opportunities.\n\nThe advantage of this approach, is that even the quickest reviewer in the first stage of evaluation, can quickly grasp the plan. If you are familial with the workload of the reviewers in the first stage, this is not trivial.\n\nFor the sake of conversation on this: do you see WP3 being responsible of the coordination of the pilots? I see WP2 would take on \"testing\", do we have a testing-&gt;piloting-&gt;deploying workflow here? Or since the emphasis is put on innovation, we consider testing=piloting and directly deploy?\n\nI understand that:\n\n1) edgeryders would flex its muscles and host a community wide conversation (within EU without borders? So on a \"global\" scale for the sake of this discourse);\n\n2) WeMake would be prototyping-and-documenting (locally) practical solutions;\n\n3)\u00a0Stockholm would design policies ...based on which layer of the community? Local? Global?\n\nMost of the \"hacking\" that happens in healthcare everyday is ultra-local, not even scalable on the regional level... I am sure you already know this, I am just bringing it up to understand how this is tackled by the WPs' structure...\n\nIt is also not clear to me how the evaluation would happen... at what level would the policies be enforced, to run the evaluation?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-05 13:00:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:00.697196", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 454, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18731, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6243, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>\"Collective intelligence\"</b>\n\nThere are two ways we could intend this term:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Humans understand things and make decisions by explaining things to each other and bouncing possible courses of action onto each other. However, humans are still the entities that do the understanding and the decisions making.</li>\n\n<li>Social systems understand things and make decisions by getting humans to interact (\"Wikipedia corrects its own mistakes\" does not require every Wikipedian to understand\u00a0or care\u00a0about every mistake, or even to know about the process).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe ethnography + networks method we pioneer in OpenCare is 2. The OpenCare conversation knows things that no participant knows. For example, no one is aware that 7 people have independently associated \"mental health\" and \"translation\".\u00a0\n\n2 requires large numbers and some kind of (self) organisation. There is too much information for the smartest person to keep in their head, and yet the system somehow behaves\u00a0in a coherent way. Task allocation, for example, can be both 1 or 2. In a company, you can use task allocation software to run a project that you understand completely: task Alice to buy a Facebook ad, task Bob to rent a car, etc., and it all comes together in your Gantt chart. In a large open source software project, task allocation is emergent: people assign themselves to tasks, with no central command. Maybe this means that nobody is taking time to develop, say, a smooth user interface. This means that the development\u00a0<em>community</em>, not any individual person or group, has decided that user interface is not important for this project.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I am not too interested in 1. Of course humans \"do stuff together\" and \"understand stuff together\": according to some scholars we are an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality\">eusocial</a> species, that's what we do. Even studying the\u00a0way people use communication tools is not super-interesting: people use the tools available. I am sure there was a lot of research on how businesses started to coordinate by telephone when that became available (\"35% of middle manager report using the telephone every day!\"), but that is not so exciting now. Of course people use chats, and online calendars etc.\u00a0The question is: does their use lead to the emergence of type 2 collectively intelligent behaviour?\u00a0\n\nIn Ezio's proposed interpretation, the conversation (online) contains past experiences, conflicting ideologies (is it better for a person with reduced mobility to have their own way of accessing the shop \u2013 the call button \u2013 or to use everyone else's?), failed attempts. This informs the decisions made in the local. The local project interlaces with\u00a0the global conversation into a collective intelligence process. Of course, sharing your local experience will then become\u00a0<em>some other project's</em>\u00a0global conversation! :)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-03 10:41:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:44.485626", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 492, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18396], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29395, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6273, "post_number": 33, "raw": "<b>Discourse installation ready to test</b>\n\nWell then, this is for the alpha tester team, esp.: @Alberto , @Noemi , @johncoate , @Nadia .

Happy playing around! All content there will be erased again, so move and create and delete whatever you want. We have to answer the following questions in order to move forward with the development. It's all about mapping our current data structures to those of Discourse:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>How to implement challenges?</strong> Our current proposal: Challenges become categories. This is nice, because unlike tags, categories are visible in the Hamburger menu. Alternative proposal: Challenges become Groups in Discourse. In Discourse, categories are presented as the typical \"forums / boards\" of discussion software, so this seems the closest match for our challenges.</li>\n\n<li><strong>How to implement channels?</strong> Channels are the multi-select field in the <a href=\"/en/node/add/challenge-response\">challenge response form</a>, then is presented <a href=\"/channels/\">like this</a>. Proposal: channels become tags. That allows one thread to belong to multiple channels (like now). So it's better than using categories, since a thread only belongs to one category in Discourse. <strong>Edit:</strong> However if we are ok with only importing one channel value per post, we can also use categories. Categories can be used to implement challenges and channels at the same time, as they are hiearchical.</li>\n\n<li><strong>How to implement supporters / multiplicators / collaborators?</strong> These are fields in the <a href=\"/en/node/add/challenge-response\">challenge response form</a>, allowing folksonomy input of multiple tags per field. Proposal: these fields become tags. Tag values can be free-form like now, or pre-defined.</li>\n\n<li><strong>How to implement challenge chains / projects?</strong> This is what keeps challenges grouped together, and also we need it as a data structure to keep content of different projects separate enough for analysis etc.. <s>No proposal yet. Maybe also tags, with some sort of auto-tagging? Like: Everything posted to this challenge will be tagged \"WB MENA Platform\".</s> <strong>Edit:</strong> A proposal is to implement this as parent categories, with all the challenges of a project being the child categories. After a project ended, parent categories may be dissolved, and challenge categories assigned to a parent category \"Completed Challenges\".</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2017-06-06 18:22:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:51.655279", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12265, "user_id": 3338, "topic_id": 5841, "post_number": 4, "raw": "In the case of Thessaloniki, the Edgeryders did not \"hire a person\".\u00a0\n\n\"Back to Commons\" IS a grassroots community of actors and young researchers that is slowly growing in different parts of Greece. Our target is mainly empowering the agents of change that exist in each city or village. We are talking to the real creators, who -unfortunately- in Greece are often overlooked by local authorities and the system in general.\n\nIn a country that has lost almost 30% of its GDP in 7 years, due to corrupt and inefficient political handling, system-level reform is NECESSARY and people feel it with their every breath. This is what energizes some of us that chose to stay back and help work it out.\u00a0Unfortunately we don't have the luxury of reflection of this process, as we see friends and community members having to quit\u00a0interesting and\u00a0promising projects because they must move to Germany, Holland or Belgium in seek of a job. For the people on the egde, here in Greece, system-level reform is not \"something unattainable for now\" but something that citizens self-organise and drive.\n\n@Natalia might have observed the people walking out in the streets of Thessaloniki, or the restaurants and cafes of the city full. This doesn't mean that there is no crisis, or the people have money to spend. It is just because Greeks care. And they go out to socialise, instead of sitting inside their home counting their money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever, things need to move forward, because there are thousands of\u00a0people and families in need over here, that think that we need to change stuff.\u00a0At this point, imagination is chief, and possibly also the only hope for a society that is full on into the \"depression phase\". What we did over the last couple of\u00a0months, is to share stories of care and give the message that \"we are mapping the Communities of Care of Greece\". This is something that, I believe, is a very strong narrative for the society. And our workshop in Thessaloniki\u00a0has managed to create this space, not telling peolpe \"what needs to be done\", but asking them (for the first time in their lives) HOW they imagine their life in this country.\n\nIn terms of the timing of the workshop, I think the overall timeframe of introducing the \\#OPENandChange\u00a0process in a country\u00a0with known problems in terms of engagement and low trust, is slim. Also, we are mapping communities who are far away from Thessaloniki. Despite\u00a0one participant that\u00a0travelled 300km to join the workshop, most of these community champions could not join the workshop physically (most such people are unemployed). Talking with initiatives in Athens, I am more and more keen in organising another such workshop in Athens. I think I have time to do this in December.\u00a0\n\nSurely, for this first workshop in Thessaloniki, it looked like we didn't know exactly what we want. But I get the impression, that we are slowly start understanding what we don't want. Which is, I believe, another major lesson to the Edgeryders community.\u00a0\n\nPS: I should probably post a story about what we do at Back to Commons, which is totally grassroots, no official entity, very far away from the corporate logic that has ruined Greece, but with certain needs in terms of fuelling\u00a0this process. Hence I put part of my modest salary into that.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-12 09:43:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.038371", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 605, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10704], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4200, "user_id": 1679, "topic_id": 4167, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We (@Ruxandra &amp; @Noemi) just had this morning a call with Laura Gillies from Imagination for People that talked us through the <a href=\"http://assembl.org\">Assembl </a>software, mainly to understand how Edgeryders people can use it.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Can it work for us?</h3>\n\nLaura says that Assembl is a tool that allows an organized discussion with a great number of participants (from minimum a couple hundreds to several thousands).

Because from our existing prototype implementation to a fast, scalable, real-world one it is usually a long way. And in the case of network barter, a technological challenge (since our prototype needed a whole night of calculations to find even the tiniest network deal in our simulation data.)\n\nHowever, due to the collaborative power of open source software, we just made a big jump forward, saving us several person months of work :) :) Meet our new friend <a href=\"http://www.coin-or.org/\">COIN-OR</a>, a solid and powerful free software library for mathematical optimization problems, provided by the mathematical science community.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6bc706766eb20c93b1be2d799224491b5e25c0fd.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"><br>\n\nThis development came about when my teammate Daniel found that network barter can be classified as a different mathematical problem: not as a match-making problem (as we did before, and is often done in <a href=\"/economy-app/scientific-background\">related scientific literature</a>), but more broadly as a deterministic linear discrete optimization problem.

This celebration is the result of 7 years of work.  <a href=\"http://www.wilderness.org/profiles/nelsonbio.htm\">Senator Gaylord Nelson</a> is the founder of Earth Day. Everything started in 1962. For several years, he was concerned about the fact that the  state of our environment was a non-issue in the politics. He started talking with president Kennedy and continued with a variety of audiences, asking them to give visibility to this issue. From year to year, media confrimed the need of an increased care of the environment. Slowly, things started to work and the necesity cumulated more and more supporters. Earth Day worked because of the spontaneous response at the grassroots level.  That was the remarkable thing about Earth Day. It organized itself.\n\nWhat have I done this year in order to celebrate Earth Day? Well...everything started when I joined <strong>ASASH</strong>. And now...you are wondering what is this all about.\n\n<strong>ASASH</strong> is the abreviaton of Association of Architecture Students \"Spiru Haret\", Romania. It's a youth organisation that has been founded by 5 enthusiastic students: Calota Emil, Mafteianu Tudor, Bulgariu Onisim, Popa Stefana, Balan Cristina. From year to year, it became more and more obvious that a new voice, a young shelter for initiative and ideas was needed. Now, since  Februarie 2011, students, supported by teachers,  develop their own ideas by being a volunteer in the faculty's association.\n\n## How we celebrate Earth Day?\n\n<strong>ASASH</strong> is organising a contest and it`s not an ordinary one! It`s not a drawing contest as you might imagine, but an inventive one: <strong><em> Recycle &amp; Create</em></strong>! The participants are supposed to use their imagination and create and object (as furniture, clothes,sculptures and so on) using only reciclyng stuff. The result of their imagination will be part of an exposition.\n\nHaven`t convinced you yet? Then, what would you say if \"the most creative brains\" would receive prizes? Prizes as: magazine subscription and invitations at ROCAD Architecture Conference. To see how amasing this will look like, come and find out on 5<sup>th </sup>of May at Spiru Haret University, Faculty of Architecture.\n\nI promise I`ll be beback with pictures from this great event. Stay tuned!\n\nUntil than, don`t forget : \"Every day is a once in a lifetime event\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Furnea Andreea Anca</em>\n\n<em><strong>ASASH</strong> President of PR Department</em>", "created_at": "2012-04-25 21:46:49", "updated_at": "2017-09-16 19:00:34.922934", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 432, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11512, "user_id": 887, "topic_id": 1462, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Smile back!</b>\n\nThanks for comment!\u00a0 I agree, smile can make you a better person.

We were the only foreigners on our flight to Tehran. The people there thought that we were standing in the wrong line, but as soon as they realized that we were on our way to Iran, visiting the old land of Persia, a group of people approached us, offered us help and asked questions. I was traveling with my friend, who is male and whose name is Karl. Why is it important that he's a male? Well. The Middle East is a man's world. I got the first taste of it at the airport in Istanbul. There was one man in particular that spoke to us. Not once he directed his question towards me. It was 'How old is your wife?' and 'Is your wife a student?' and 'What's your wife's name?'. Questions I was perfectly capable of answering myself. But I was now a woman in a man's world. I was on my way to Iran where I am the property of my husband. I am not married, I don't even have a boyfriend. Karl and I are simply friends. Thus, we were breaking the law for consecutive two weeks in Iran. Not the only laws we broke. Perhaps the most serious crime I committed during my trip was to go outside wearing shorts and leaving my hijab inside. For whole ten minutes. \u00a0</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#736357\">Traveling in Iran was a wonderful experience. It was unique. We decided to use Couch Surfing. For those not familiar with that, it's a webpage where random people offer you their couch to sleep on in order to make your experience richer and cheaper. It was great, because we got the chance of talking to so many Iranian people that we otherwise would never had met. It was amazing because we got the chance to peek into their daily lifes. You know, the 80's was just as prevalent in Iran as in Europe. They had the same big sweaters with geometric prints, ugly haircuts (there's a reason why mullets are banned in Iran) and bright colours. The difference between my family pictures from the 80's and 90's and the ones I was in Iran? Not big.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#736357\">Because I'm a carpe diem kind of person I decided to try hitchhiking in Iran. Well, hitchhiking is not a known concept in Iran. You pay for your ride, so it was tricky to make people understand that we didn't want to pay for our ride but just ride along. It was amazing. The first time, while I was on my way from Isfahan to Yazd, a small white car finally stopped for us. We were offered a ride from a brother and sister who were on their way to Yazd. The girl, well, woman spoke English. What's interesting about this is that it was one of three women I had the chance to speak to during my two weeks stay in Iran. We were approached by strangers all the time, but language difficulties were prevalent and cultural differences made it taboo for women to approach us. Her name is Parisa, she is twenty five years old and hasn't had a boyfriend in five years. She invited us for drinks at her place the same evening, whiskey or wine, but we politely declined. We had other plans. Alcohol is not particularly legal in Iran. The day after we had dinner together at this fancy restaurant in Yazd. It was a unique experience because I got to talk to a woman my age about living in Iran. And what's maybe more important, she got to meet me. A free western woman who can travel with back pack with her friend who she's not married to. Our couch surfer in that city told us that for women travelers in Iran, just being there is important. For girls, seeing a woman walking around with a backpack and the Lonely Planet guide has perhaps more impact than I realized. It shows them indepence of a woman, something that many of them are not very familiar with. Parisa was very excited to meet us and the chance for her to talk to us was perhaps more important than anything we did in this trip. We had the opportunity to exchange opinions, news and views on living in Iran or Europe. I suspect that the impact of our dinner in Dad hotel in Yazd had more impact on her than I realized at the time but her interest in English, the world and interest in activism against the ruling government has increased since I met her last July, according to her Facebook posts and her e-mails. Parisa and I still exchange e-mails from time to time and now she is studying English translation at the University, after more than five years of working full time at a desk job in a factory.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#736357\">Iran is a strange place. The most private place to buy a bra is in the woman's cell in the metro. The bottle of whisky is cheaper in Iran than in Iceland, but of course more deathly to consume in Iran than in Iceland. People there are friendly and welcoming. They are proud of their history, their country, literature and language. We met people that loved Imam Khomeini and Ahmendinajad. Mostly, we met people that just wanted to be free. To be free to wear shorts and long hair, free to go on Facebook and Twitter. They want to watch American soap operas and reality TV. They just want to be normal. But people continue living even though police officers patrol their appearance and control who they talk to on the street. It's strange how people continue on with life, having their daily drama and romances when living in a such an authoritarian country like Iran.</font>\n\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/persepolis.jpg\" title=\"\">\n\nAt Persepolis.

We communicated mostly through phones- numbers weren't too hard to come by. There were a couple times when we met up with people directly in Kathmandu as well. There were also times when other organizations informed us about the situation in some localities. In time, we realized that we liked outside information better than local information. Local information was at times skewed because ( I am going to sound very crass here) we felt that a lot of villages and communities(sadly) had this sense of entitlement for relief materials, even when we could see that they were relatively more resilient/more elastic communities than others. But then again, you except that during days filled with uncertainty like these..\n\nWhen we started out, we tried to be more comprehensive with our relief materials. We started out with tarpaulin sheets, food for a family for a week ( beaten rice, rice), mosquito nets, basic medication, mattresses etc. But as days ticked by, we started realizing that the need for temporary shelters in affected areas was the most compelling/immediate one. After that, we focused a lot of our energy in setting up a supply mechanism for tarpaulin sheets ( which were in short supply at that time) and getting them to places where they were needed the most. That didn't mean that we completely gave up on other relief materials. When some communities we reached to asked for food or other materials, we tried our best to get them for them. For example, a community in SIndhupalchowk told us how they were having problems charging their cell phones due to the lack of electricity and there was no communication with the outer world, we found solar mobile charging stations and got them there.\u00a0\n\nFrom what we have seen and heard, affected people are still looking for temporary shelter materials. In the face of the impending monsoon torrents, I think that is the thing people should prioritize for. ( I think that is happening though).\n\nFor the longer term, shelter (of course) is necessary. The villages that we have been to have lost their structures but their source of livelihood is still there ( where there haven't been landslides)- the fields are OK, and are full of crops. There have been a lot of groups that have come forward to help, but I am worried about \u00a0HOW this help is going to be given. I think we should help without undermining the elasticity of the amazing people who live in places so far away from our comfortable urban centers. We need to help them for sure, but the help should be supplementary, mostly in form of knowledge about disaster proof, resilient building technologies, greener alternatives, better sanitation measures and of course, some ( some, is important) financial backing. We do need to get our schools and hospitals upright, I think we need to start with these.\n\nI would love to tell you that it is time to hand it to the government, but I don't think our government is ready. I do think that small, self organized groups can provide a pivotal role in providing long lasting effort if they work with the government. Our government needs support from groups like us, it wasn't ready for this.\u00a0\n\nHope that was helpful!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 05:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.828933", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 615, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27824, "user_id": 3279, "topic_id": 777, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Keep the the conversations open</b>\n\n@Noemi\u00a0The program was for all students. As far as what was the \u201ccrossover\u201d there were numerous reasons. One of the main factors that I think diminished the resistance, was realizing that within a group of people, and the diverse cultures, there was a slew of similarities. The challenges were the same, the way the challenge presented itself may have been different. Students seeing breakthrough conversations- gaining confidence to overcome challenges. The safety net of the group/community and explore better ways of interacting with others. The strict standards of confidentiality were equally as important. Records of participation were not accessible to parents, teachers, faculty, and deans etc. Unless there were certain circumstances. The students themselves had to give authorization for anyone\u2019s inquiry. Which made the students in control of the situation.\u00a0 Which is always of value.\n\nBeing a university student \u2013 as you know -- can be a difficult balancing act. It is easy to get weighed down with the pressures of academics, social life, and choosing a major and so on.\u00a0 If personal problems are piled on top of these pressures, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed. There were different groups and workshops which made it easy for them to identify with.\n\nThere was distress tolerance, learning how to improve coping skills, groups range in\u00a0diverse areas.\u00a0 Workshops were topical with a therapeutic focus and the students realized they were helping each other. Encouraging open and frank discussions while getting to the core. As a psychology student, we started a group with the focus of awareness of mental health and resilience (it started as a project) For students by students -showing support is beneficial to manage the inevitable ups and downs and the resources available. \u00a0Mental wellness was brought into the light \u2013 which it\u2019s ok to talk about it. From there the students that were not really \u201cinterested\u201d took another look at the options available with a different perspective.\n\nYears later when working with JP Morgan Investment in NYC I did facilitate\u2013 employee support programs.\n\n@ <a href=\"/t/building-tweeting-communities-for-mental-health-nursing-with-wemhnurses/518\">the Story</a> you mentioned- quite interesting! open discussions help.....\u00a0can\u2019t get any more open than Twitter. \u00a0Using it to share info, raise awareness and openly discuss mental health problems from different perspectives.\u00a0Social media is changing the world, and its changing how people with issues connect with each other. The capability to learn from , share not only in the immediate localities but over the globe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-25 23:20:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.472828", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 447, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12727, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1367, "post_number": 4, "raw": "That's funny..

It is through this place these young merged with the village dwellers , especially young people , where they discussed their problems and their needs , and then identified the dreams and aspirations of the village where they live , which in turn has provided solutions to the problems that were discussed in advance.\n\nThe problems are not much different from the problems of the rest of the cities and villages in Egypt , unemployment , lack of services of clean drinking water and sanitation services , lack of waste management and lack Algveh of vegetables and fruits where forced to move to another place to get them and other problems affect their lives in general. But the positive side of the subject that these young people responded to the idea of \u200b\u200bcollective action and discussed effective proposals to get rid of their problems added to the experiences of young people who were the owners of the idea as a moral support to these young people . Has been put to the nucleus of an integrated project improves the level of the village and the living standards of the service, it was the expertise and skills of the youth of the village that is this project according to specific stages and tidy .\n\nSteps of the project:\nScheme was developed initially to form the next village and places of activities proposed for implementation , and its future extension . And was the garbage problem of the most important problems that had to be dealt with first , has been dealing with it by spreading the thought of separation of waste at source ( houses) and then assembled and sent to the recycling stage . Has been the extraction of compost from organic waste and use it in improving the land in preparation for the reclamation and sale of surplus , and the sale of other waste plastic, paper and others. The gain on sale of waste have great credit in the implementation of the rest of the activities desired project kidneys , Fbtba profits this part of the project, we were able to create a small-scale projects to benefit from the palm , which is famous for its region and produced by mussels and development of new products it suitable for marketing in global markets , also residues sieving of palm leaves can establish a small factory to be recycled and used to manufacture a new type of timber , which allocates a young owners of the idea. then the profits from these projects has been the establishment of a small factory for recycling of plastic or paper . Then plant the production of biogas from organic waste , which is supported by the experience of a young owners of the idea.\n\nThere was a parallel process of reclamation of the land to be configured for the cultivation of what it needs people of the village of vegetables and fruits , have been initiated in the process of drilling and extraction of ground water using solar energy to irrigate the reclaimed land and the provision of food .\nHave been deployed to the idea of \u200b\u200bthe project and what he did the youth of the village as a preliminary step for the development of the single pages, social networking , began to young people from other provinces interest in the subject and took flock to post one by one which required the presence of housing units have been designed from the reality of the general character of the area and local materials Dawnay, eco-friendly participated in the construction of the villagers of craftsmen , that is generated by the energy used by the solar panels .\n\nDid not forget the people of the village with crafts and the ladies so we create a center for handicrafts for their development , development and training housewives to keep these crafts from extinction and selling products to raise the standard of living of the people of the village.\n\nThus began the village 's development step by step according to the phases studied by the youth of the village and their supporters from the owners of the idea , this has been retained important \"flat collective action \" to train young people of the village and coming from other places , motivate and integrate them at every stage , each according to their skills and experience .

We have 20+ paid software development tasks available, immediately \"up for grabs\" for the Edgeryders community. You got that right, <em>paid work</em> :-)\n\nContext: We are currently working on a tool that will make edgeryders.eu a powerhouse for collaborative online ethnographic research, and will also result in tight semantic web integration. The tool is called <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">Open Ethnographer</a>, will be open source software, and is funded by a grant from Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nAlongside developing this to a release, we want to provide paid work to developers in the Edgeryders community along the way. And of course, offload some of the work because else I'd be the (l)on(e)ly developer ;-)\n\nSo, starting immediately we have paid tasks available for software developers in the Edgeryders community. Here's what is available so far \u2013 more tasks will emerge over the development in December and January, and then added here. Depending on the task, you will need to know JavaScript and / or PHP (Drupal knowlegde is a plus), and of course HTML &amp; CSS. Required languages are indicated in square brackets below. Not all have (linked) fully detailed descriptions or budgets yet; but just tell in the comments what task you want details for and I will provide the details for these right away.\n\n<em>Strikethrough indicates that a task is completed, or discarded.</em>\n\n<ol id=\"tasklist\">\n\n<li><strong><span><a href=\"/t/add-config-options-to-hide-parts-of-the-ecomma-ui/3940\">Add config options to hide parts of the eComma UI</a></span>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Find out if CATMA includes code management / hierarchy building features.</strong></span></li>\n\n<li><strong><span><a href=\"/t/exchange-the-ecomma-annotation-creating-javascript-with-annotator/3937\">Exchange the markup creation JavaScript code with Annotator</a></span>.</strong> [JavaScript, PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><span><a href=\"/t/install-annotator-into-edgeryders-eu-and-document-how-to-do-it/3985\">Install Annotator into edgeryders.eu and document how to do it</a></span>.</strong> [Drupal config]</li>\n\n<li><strong><span>Implement that tagging refers to a revision</span>.</strong> [PHP] This way, an edit will no longer cause a loss of all notifications as it happens with eComma currently. But as discussed in the comments below, quasi-random word IDs already serve that purpose, and better. For exporting a date-specific version of coding work, revisions of the text are of no use either, instead we'd need a coding creation date field.</li>\n\n<li><strong><span>Integrate eComma into the Drupal theme as a static right-column element</span>.</strong> [PHP, CSS, HTML] It should be possible to fold this element into a compact toolbar (which would then be a non-static element, allowing to see other right-column elements then).</li>\n\n<li><strong><span><a href=\"/t/implement-storing-annotations-relative-to-content-not-content-display/3991\">Implement storing annotations relative to content, not content display</a></span>.</strong> [PHP, JavaScript]</li>\n\n<li><strong><span><a href=\"/t/implement-tagging-in-annotator-with-realtime-tag-filtering/3942\">Implement tagging in Annotator with realtime tag filtering</a></span>.</strong> [JavaScript]</li>\n\n<li><strong><span>Implement AJAX-based code creation within Annotator</span>.</strong> [PHP] This should happen in the annotator_view sidebar, so it obviously depends on the task to integrate this first. Also, links should be added that point to the Drupal taxonomy interface for more advanced operations (merge, delete etc.). This is now replaced with on-the-fly tag creation in the Annotator tagging UI (increasing the budget of the corresponding task above).</li>\n\n<li><strong><span>Implement tag selection by selecting a known tag in a hierarchy</span>.</strong> [JavaScript] Might be possible with an existing Annotator plugin. However, it is more or less decided that we do not want hierarchies, and that tag selection by instant search is enough as a single fast and consistent tag selection option.</li>\n\n<li><strong><s><a href=\"/t/implement-basic-exporting-of-codings-to-a-caqdas-tool/3977\">Implement basic exporting of codings</a></s>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><s><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/15\">Implement the \"view annotation\" feature with annotator_view</a></s>.</strong> [PHP, JavaScript]</li>\n\n<li><strong><s><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/17\">Implement RDFa output of all public codings in live content</a></s>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/18\">Ability to fork a public tag of another user</a>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/20\">Implement a feature to select which content to include in an export</a>.</strong> [PHP] Basic exporting is already covered in a previous task.</li>\n\n<li><strong><s><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/21\">Implement merging and deleting tags</a></s>. </strong>[PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><s><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/22\">Implement a quotation manager</a></s>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"/t/modify-annotator-to-use-quasi-random-word-id-tags-for-stand-off-annotation/3941\">Modify Annotator to use quasi-random word ID tags for stand-off annotation</a>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/23\">Fix that CKEditor's \"Remove markup\" button removes word IDs</a>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/24\">Implement private tags</a>.</strong> [PHP]</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/25\">Implement showing / hiding others' public tags in viewed text</a>.</strong> [PHP, JavaScript]  [<span>optional; undecided</span>]</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAnd several tasks for usability enhancement related to the use of Open Ethnographer inside edgeryders.eu:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Improve the CKEditor styles to improve content creation for study participants.</strong> [PHP] This means developing a better set of paragraph and character styles for the \"Styles\" menu shown inside CKEditor, and then rendering them inside CKEditor and in the final content the same way.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Fix cut&amp;paste changes to formatting inside CKEditor.</strong> [Drupal config] To improve content creation for study participants.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Improve the look of content created by study participants by limiting their use of HTML.</strong> [Drupal config] Study participants should only be able to use formatting provided via the CKEditor styles menu. Admins would be able to additionally use \"Full HTML\" mode, which would not have these limitations.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Prevent empty lines at the end of content.</strong> [Drupal config] This is meant to improve the look of content created by study participants. It should be implemented by adding an automatic content filter that will delete empty lines at the end of content, or just not show them when rendering the content (which is the more usual way how Drupal handles changes to content \u2013 namely, making them only effective for viewing, not saving them).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Improve the user experience of study participants by overhauling the main navigation structure.</strong> [Drupal config, CSS] This includes introducing a two-level drop-down main menu, and integrating an (optional, already existing) group menu cleanly with the main menu.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Improve the user experience of study participants by redesigning some of the major hub pages of the website.</strong> [Drupal config, CSS] This would include the <a href=\"/t/newblog/415\">blog index page</a> and about four other ones. [<span>optional</span>]</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nCollaborating \"as a crowd\" on a paid software development project like this is new in Edgeryders (I think), so consider the first tasks \u2013 and their budgets mentioned in the tasks \u2013 a bit experimental and tell me what works and what has to be improved.\n\n<strong>Here's how to collaborate:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Assign to yourself.</strong> If you want to work on a task, just add a comment and fill the field to assign it to yourself. (Tasks are first come, first served, but there are enough \u2026)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Start working right away.</strong> We have a tight project plan, so if you want to collaborate, start right away. And if you assign yourself a task, make sure you can work it off in a matter of days so we can proceed with dependent tasks.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Delivery.</strong> Delivery should be as a Github pull request from a feature branch in your fork to <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer\">edgeryders/openethnographer</a>. This repository uses Git subtrees, and we have <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer-manual/3939\">instructions</a> for its usage. Then simply put a link to the pull request into a comment on the task here on edgeryders.eu. All other communication about your code (pull request additions, issue tracker issues etc.) will then happen on Github.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Payment.</strong> Payment happens after your code was tested and integrated by @matthias and after you have sent an invoice to Edgeryders. You can aggregate several tasks before sending an invoice (and it makes our administration side easier as well.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Bugs?</strong> If there are bugs after payment that prohibit <em>basic</em> functioning, you will have to fix them within the budget. You don't have to worry about any small bugs though (edge cases, nice-to-have features etc.). If you find bugs in Open Ethnographer, <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/new\">create a new issue on Github</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Questions?</strong> I (@matthias) will be available on short notice for all questions regarding development environment setup and what the task exactly means. See <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/contact\">my contact information</a>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<small>Photo credits: by Alosh Bennett, CC-BY 2.0, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/aloshbennett/2231572509\">Flickr Image 2231572509</a></small>", "created_at": "2014-11-25 00:47:37", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 06:09:56.514871", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1669, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24622, "user_id": 3129, "topic_id": 5480, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Interested in learning more </b>\n\nI've really been impressed with the unique approach of the Edgeryders community, and I would love to explore what we could do in a development space.

bring forward their own interpretations,\n\nand how they position themselves in relation to potential for action.\n\n<span>I understand Edgeryders in itself is, from my point of view, a dynamic conception evolving over time.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>note :\u00a0this is a message</span><span>\u00a0that may be edited over time</span>\n\n///\n\nWhat I currently notice,\u00a0\n\nis a central, closly knit bunch of people who are very actively engaged into coordinating.\n\n///\n\nI wish to bring forward some examples I witnessed in the past, with other organizations / networks.\n\n- A first important point I need to underline - is that often \"network\" and \"organization\" are used interchangeably, while I believe they need to be seen as different - with several organizations and projects being able to be supportive of an intentional network, yet being very aware of NOT letting one or more organizations end up taking control or assuming to \"represent\" the network.\n\n- A second very important point, is for such organizations to support an intentional network without enclosing it, I see the importance in the organizations and legal frameworks supporting infrastructure that can serve as a commons for the ( non enclosed ) intentional networks.\n\nThe organizations can choose who they want to govern themselves and operate, and their support in resources is aimed at intentional commons.\n\nThe big risk I see is in having organizations and individuals taking conrol on a commons.\n\n///\n\nSome more specific examples,\n\nFrom my personal past experience with other networks / organizations over the last 12 years ( including european youth movements related to green political parties , but also hospitality networks , ... )\n\nI noticed patterns of a few very motivated people concentrating\u00a0all the work in their own hands over time.\n\nBy doing so, I realized that defacto the power ends up centralized.\n\nI also realize this can lead to burnouts, by making processes dependent on specific people.\n\nI realized\u00a0such people would be very competent workaholics.\n\nI could see a progressive dissempowerment of the community\u00a0because of the centralization of contextual information. \u00a0Political games would be played,\u00a0enclosures\u00a0created\u00a0that would be\u00a0shared only with\u00a0a few\u00a0political allies and collaborators. \u00a0 These would often, in my personal experience, be related to specific priviledges , that would range from covering costs for attending meetings ( this is likely the most acceptable form in my view, as long as it supports a commons ), to specific priviledges of paid positions , or power positions within a specific organization.\n\nA common patterns I also noticed in my past experience, is that a small minority would build on the enthusiasm of community, and end up representing such community, or rather, a networked intentional community. \u00a0In the case of the young greens, just a few individuals claimed representing over 20 000 people, even though most of these people where inactive, or did not even know they where being represented. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn\u00a0the case of hospitality networks, I noticed progressive developments which in the case of couchsurfing, lead\u00a0what initially was a network into evolving into\u00a0a not for profit organization, and then into a corporation. \u00a0 \u00a0 I witnessed developments and migrations of volunteers, who actually made the success and developed the networks , move from hospitalityclub to couchsurfing and then later to bewelcome. \u00a0 I will be happy to detail some of the underlining dynamics, related to power and governance, for those who may not be accustomed to these networks and their underlining forms of organization and development.\n\nI wish to discuss on this thread, ways to focus on supporting a commons in the form of an intentional network, eventually through using or partnersing with organizations or institutions, while at the same time defending such commons.\u00a0\n\nI also wish to invite us to have a look at this thread :\n\n<a href=\"/t/design-ating-purpose/1934/22\">https://edgeryders.eu/comment/6621#comment-6621</a>\n\nwhere I\u00a0raised a few questions about branding, or more exactly identifiers.\n\nThe identifiers, and diversity of identifiers, imho also has an influence on understanding the agencies, and potential liberty of internal modes of organization of such brands / identifiers\n\n( for example, Nadia suggests the following social contract draft - which may apply for a specific space, identified with a specific brand, but for me can not apply to the commons created :\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/114752294/Edgeryders-2-0-Social-Contract-proposal\">http://www.scribd.com/doc/114752294/Edgeryders-2-0-Social-Contract-proposal</a>\u00a0)\n\n\u00a0\n\nand the potential differentiation between the understanding of a commons and an enclosed environment.\n\nI also wish to understand the social contracts related to each of such \"spaces\", as to enable each to understand expectations and potential outcomes of each of such spaces, and make better judgement and choices regarding participation and support.\n\n///\n\nTo have a better understanding of what I mean by empowerment, this scale / ladder of empowerment can be useful :\u00a0\n\n<a

Eliot\u00a0</a> </span></span></span></h1>\n\nVisualizing the future has become the transnational pastime of the imaginative. If you spend enough time among them, you will inevitably meet a <a href=\"http://listverse.com/2013/12/22/10-people-who-claimed-to-be-time-travelers/\">time traveller</a> who will tell you how the future will be. People tend to talk about the future as an escape from the present. It's a temporal place where no one exists yet; it's neither <a href=\"http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poem/item/12018/poem_org_video_left/0/poem_english\">here nor there.</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/_OyXQ_YsilU?t=1m8s\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a65112d06b9d4dddd5e8a35460347bbfe23f44fc.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"411\"><br></a>\n\nThe \"future\" is therefore a tool to describe and shape the present. If you can momentarily transpose yourself to an imaginary place from which to observe the present, then you can somehow change your perspective without actually changing your views.\n\nEveryone is working towards the future because the future is the only thing that any two living people on this planet might have in common. No two people have a similar experience of the present, yet they fool themselves into believing so due to their mutual dependence on the future. The future is therefore a trap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/hH6UynI5m7Y\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen people start talking to you about the future, they become bearable to listen to, because what they are saying is just their <em>malleable</em> version of things, it doesn't actually have to be that way. Whereas if they were talking about the <em>finite</em> present you would find them infinitely disagreeable. Why is that?\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/V46MUYE_MGI\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause the present just <em>is</em> and as unacceptable as it seems to be, hearing about the future makes the present more palatable. We can deal with wars, starvation, undistributed wealth, hate and slow internet if we can imagine that one day all those problems will be replaced with much worse ones.\n\nIn fact, these problems will pale in significance to the \"future problem\" of being stuck in the future, which is where we all are now. We are stuck in the future while being in the present, which is one of the most severe forms of isolation possible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/48716118\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/48716118\">THEMROC (Claude Faraldo, 1973)</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/spectacletheater\">Spectacle Theater</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause if we are all living out our myriad versions of the future in our imaginations, then who is here to run the present?

It is very hard to find a balance when we want them to become self-sustainable in the long run. How long shall we provide the housing subsidies? How to help the refugees to become self-sustainable in the long run? What criteria should be used to qualify the family? How can social workers stay objective in evaluating each case? What if after 3-6 months of support none of the family members are able to find a job? What if the available jobs are hardly enough to pay the rent? </span>\n\n<span>E.g. A single father with 4 kids(one of them is mentally disabled) and he just has no way to work even though his disabled son started attending an art therapy workshop(from 10AM to 2PM) he still needs to cook, clean and do house chores during that time. There is no part time job available for him and he is not motivated to look for one neither; he needs psychological help but he refuses it. The government can not offer him a stipend(40 Euros per child/month) since he is not yet a citizen of Armenia and even if he receives the stipend it will not be enough to sustain his family.</span>\n\nAnother problem we are facing in Armenia is the facilitation of information communication for the refugees: we got many organisations that offer different kind of assistance but it seems like refugees do not have access to the information and feel lost when they need help(healthcare, housing, employment, food/clothing, etc).\u00a0\n\nI am currently doing a desk research about how to improve the social services for the refugees here in Armenia. The aim is to mobilize all the organisations working with refugees to create an independent unit of trained social workers(including many Syrian-Armenians as it would provide them with a job and they are naturally motivated to help other refugees) and create an effective system to deal with the issues of Syrian refugees in Armenia.\n\nHere's<a href=\"http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68332\"> a recent article</a> about the hardships many refugees face in Armenia and<a href=\"http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/new-blog/2015/12/11-why-should-armenian-organizations-work-together-to-ensure-resiliancy-in-the-face-of-the-syrian-migrant-crisis\"> another one</a> about why Armenian organisations should work together to ensure resiliency in the face of the Syrian migrant crisis.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"font-size: 1.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Tentative agenda</h3>\n\n<span>Coming soon.\u00a0</span>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"font-size: 1.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<a id=\"PreWorkshop\" name=\"PreWorkshop\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\"></a>Before the workshop</h3>\n\nComing soon.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"font-size: 1.4em; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<a id=\"References\" name=\"References\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\"></a>Possible references:</h3>\n\nReading the references is not obligatory at all!

While i do agree that online engagement's cornerstone is writing, it is double-edged sword and here is why. If you havent already, I highly recommend a book called <a href=\"http://www.netdelusion.com/\">Net Delusion</a> by Evgeny Morozov, who argues, among many things, that that very fact of writing (aka participating in social media outlets) makes people feel comfortable with themselves and gives them a certain - and mostly false - delusion of accomplishment. Cases in point, to various degrees, were Iranian Twitter revolution, Haiti events, etc.</span>\n\n<span>So while I am conscious that online engagement implies more involvement in certain ways, I am not sure it is all good. Consider the fact the the pure virtuality of communication online is just that: virtual. Many people cant appreciate enough or consider enough gravity/implicatins of online relationships in comparison to real-life relationships (hence terms such as 'Facebook friends' etc). And secondly, with prevalence and ubiquity of Facebooks, Twitters, etc, online engagement is much more part of current generation's daily routine, and requires but little effort. Testimony to this is the amount of noise/useless info posted on countless sites including the same Facebook by all kinds of people.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Moreover, by my own experience, lots of face-to-face meetings and participation in conferences/seminars, is a way better way to get things going, especially in the developing world, where people appreciate much the human factor.</span>\n\n<span>Just to be clear, I am not trying to trash the idea of online engagement. I do think its vital and I do believe social media has way more power and potential for impact than any regular media. My main argument is that many people get carried away by social media and think of it as means in itself. Social media is just media (but a fast and omniconnected one, for that matter), an end to something else, and this message must be clear.</span>\n\n<span>Am not a social media skeptic (i actully train startups to use social media for their own businesses), but have just seen - among others, on TakingITGlobal, the biggest youth portal on Internet - my fare share of online blah-blah-blah without much real action.

I had no idea this stuff was going on in China.\n\nI am particularly interested in the conflictual relationship between doctors and patients. This could be a very serious drag on the system. Liability laws, even when they are well-meaning, end up disincentivizing doctors to intervene, especially on cases that are serious and desperately need help. One of my uncles, a gynaecologist in New York, once told me that his liability insurance was far and away his highest cost, and that patients would sue for absolutely anything. In America, you can sue for astronomically high sums, because they have a legal insititution called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punitive_damages\">punitive damage</a>. If somebody causes you trouble, you can sue not only to recover the costs of the damage done, but also to \"punish\" the offender. Punishment depends on subjective evaluation of the offense, i.e. on\u00a0how deeply you have been made unhappy by the offense: the more unhappy, the more money you can demand. Unsusrprisingly,\u00a0\u00a0most people say they are\u00a0<em>very</em>\u00a0unhappy, and demand a lot of money.\n\nIn this situation, he explained,\u00a0if you see a woman with a potentially troubled pregnancy, you'd better stay the hell away from her. If you try to treat her and she or the baby have issues, she'll sue you into a smoking hole. But if you don't touch her, then you are good. Of course,\u00a0<em>she</em>\u00a0might suffer from lack of treatment, and that's too bad but not really your problem.

Thanks to <a href=\"/u/iamkat\">@iamkat</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/danohu\">@danohu</a>\u00a0for documenting. The unstructured notes are available <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Curators-Feedback-OkvHWEsANF2\">here</a>.</em>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On disruption from the current system and interfacing with policy and politics</h3>\n\nA general take was that stewardship challenges models based on ownership. It opens up and enhances the use value of things rather than holding it captive. Most case studies and projects we looked at are initiatives ran by individuals or small groups, fixing a specific problem rather than taking on systemic approaches. This has to do with capacity, but mostly with a distinct take on our relationship with politics. At the beginning of Lote4 @hexayurt and @Leo, among others, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/112143480\">made it clear</a> that\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<div><em>rather than thinking of this as being about how do we persuade the state to support us, perhaps it\u2019s more a question of how do we support the state not to beat the hell out of us when we begin to support ourselves</em></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nIs leaving the government out a sustainable way to move forward? Or to take the Makerfox example: can we do everything without money?\n\n<em>Many of our questions are policy questions</em>, underlined Amelia.\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<div><em>People can take away the fact it's not useless to get in touch with the democratically elected institutions - when you have a project and you want it to be supported don't be afraid to get that extra political leverage. [...] If you're an EU citizen, find a politician from where you live, send them a (polite) email -- it's easy. \u00a0If you're a nomad, pick someone at random. What do you do if they don't answer? If you fail with the first go on to the next one - have a list of around 4 or 5. The least they can do is ask a written question to the EC - it's at least some action and gives you documented support of your issue being important which is helpful for local authorities. You can play institutions against themselves.</em></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nOne example is hacking the legal loopholes of the copyright reform at EU level and starting with modest aims: have the EC accept the <a href=\"http://copyrightcode.eu/\">copyrightcode.eu</a>, an easy to understand text explaining copyright in just five articles (also backed by a petition),\u00a0then ensure that as little lobbying as possible is made to destroy that proposal.\n\nFor Fabrizio, relationship with the state manifests itself in two approaches. One is the \"buzz off\" approach where you have an absent state, the other one is the \"Make a deal\" approach, more complex, where there is cooperation involved (eg change the grantmaking system, influence evidence based provision of services by creating new data). The later allows for \"infiltration\".\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<div><em>In discussing the state, we have missed understanding that the state is made of persons. In Italy, the state is 2.8 million people. Because they are people, they behave in different ways.</em></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On stewardship models and methodology</h3>\n\nOne of the main issues is gathering the knowledge that is mostly dispersed when it comes to projects led by the citizenry. Most of us agree documentation is important. Fabrizio and Caroline pointed at\u00a0a need to self-evaluate to understand complexity better, and the four sectors within which stewardship takes place: technological, cultural, economical, institutional. Some key points raised to help improve the work:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>starting point: are we filling the gaps of the current system or are we shaping a new system (eg open source projects)? is this stewardship forming from within the community or coming from outside? how do I influence the other sectors?</li>\n\n<li>timespan: for how long should the stewardship go on? can the community continue with or without sustained leadership</li>\n\n<li>outcome: are we truly improving people\u2019s quality of life?</li>\n\n<li>validation: combining the dots of wanting to fit in the present and have some recognition payback</li>\n\n<li>resilience: we are very much output oriented - what is the longer term goal?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Building participation and freedom while supporting the stewards</h3>\n\nFor Robin it is clear that there \u201cthere does need to be a community of people working on these hard problems of rebuilding the economy and building a world we want<em>\u201d </em>and one way to go is by building platforms for participation and pooling of resources. The assumption is that there is an ability to express freedom and desire, and that people know what they want, and act under an implicit agreement on the direction shaping the way forward (points made by Nadia and Gaia in particular; see <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Curators-Feedback-OkvHWEsANF2\">Fabrizio\u2019s counter argument</a> on the dangers of paternalistic stewardship eg birth of fascism)\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<div><em>The key to communities stewarding assets is the ability to steward and transmit knowledge to each other. Resilience comes from redundancy and enough people knowing about other people so that the right people are in touch with each other. (Nadia)</em></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nKey questions rose around the way platforms are instrumental to participation. In some examples from the sharing economy, even if communities are participatory, the platform itself is centralized, so members risk serving the platform, not the community. And when platforms are created by its users, who is supporting the long term, sustained, intensive effort? This goes in two ways: the need to cover permanent stewardship (costs of the infrastructure, almost always present) and the need for sustained leadership (depends on the stewardship model). Matthias brought up the point of freedom and inclusiveness, saying it's not enough just to put a digital project up as open source, and expect that to create freedom. We need to make work open for public contributions - don't exclude people, let them add something.\n\nIf we are to think of ways to grow initiatives and support one another as we run with limited resources, the question hanging is how do we do this kind of work in a sustained way? All points above essentially touch on sustainability. Any other thoughts?

He grew up as a poor orphan boy, and he swore he would never forget the orphans and other disadvantaged people. He has not. He has spent his life helping all sorts of people, from where he lives in Lalitpur, Nepal, just outside of Kathmandu, to the decision by him and his partners to devote 25% of the profits of their travel and tourism business to Madhav's charity work, (<a href=\"http://www.sunkoshiholidays.com\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=yes,dependent=no'); return false;\">You can read all about it on his website HERE</a>)\u00a0\n\nFinally, last year, he was able to found Community Service of Nepal... the Board of Directors was mostly women by design, to empower women, and also two men. The nonprofit has been active in training underprivileged women employable skills.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10446596_694137670647342_5543553999184004483_n.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10446596_694137670647342_5543553999184004483_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\n<span>The organization also took the Kopila Chidrens Center - a 30 child orphanage - under its \u00a0protection.

I have SO MANY photos of this man in action, it is difficult to know which ones will best tell his story.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10436186_760842107288628_795059308835459330_n.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10436186_760842107288628_795059308835459330_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\nAFTER THE EARTHQUAKE, first there was the TERROR of not knowing whether our friends in Nepal were dead or alive! After we located everyone we learned that Madhav was with the orphans, and that they were safe!! It was amazing to have everyone alive after so many people were lost!! The orphans are now housed in a strong building, and our donations are going toward their food, etc. as needed.\n\nHowever, MANY THOUSANDS of people have not yet received aid in the widely scattered villages of Sindhulpachok where we are focusing our efforts now. There are around 6000 completely homeless people in only the three villages of Dhuskun, Piskar and Chokati right now, and there are around 100 of these extremely inaccessible villages in that district alone. The problem is MUCH BIGGER than the 6000 people we are focusing on, but we do have to start SOMEWHERE, when the entire country is like a War Zone!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/402696_411940335533745_486865376_n.jpg\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/402696_411940335533745_486865376_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\nHere is a photo of Dhuskun before the earthquake (the village in the foreground - It is much bigger than it looks, but a lot of it is hidden in the trees.) It is about 2 hours trek straight up the hillside (\"mountainside\" in any other country) from the main road, which is down at the bottom of the Sunkoshi River Valley. THE BLUE BUILDING is a community school that our founder helped build over 10 years ago.\n\nMadhav Bhandari grew up in this area,so he immediately went to see for himself how bad the damage is in that area. \u00a0He went in before the road was repaired, and then climbed up to see how the villagers were living. It is a scene of great devastation!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SIndhupalchok8.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SIndhupalchok8.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SIndhupalchok7.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SIndhupalchok7.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11138568_893443040716803_8667273010304372524_n.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11138568_893443040716803_8667273010304372524_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\nAt first, we thought to purchase strong relief tents to supplement the tarpaulins that the other nonprofits are distributing (while drawing attention to the extreme need in the area so that the people WOULD FINALLY GET the tarps and food aid in the first place. We found a source for 1000 tents that could be delivered from New Delhi within 5-6 days for approximately $100 each, and with the monsoon season's driving heavy rains due to start ANY DAY NOW and dump 1500 mm of rain on the area before September, we have been collecting money to give them good tents. But we need to raise all of the funds, to deliver them at once, due to the GROUP orientation of the Nepali culture. To buy the tents for some of the people at a time as we get the money would NOT WORK. It would create a strong resentment between the people who have shelter and the people who have not received it yet. So far, we have several thousand US dollars in Madhav's trustworthy care. He is building the fund while carefully controlling spending to the bare necessities of the situation. He is an extremely ethical man, whom I have known and worked closely with for 6 years, and I would trust him with my donations before anyone else. \u00a0To buy the needed tents will cost USD$100,000! we are raising funds at our fund-raiser website <a href=\"http://www,communityserviceofNepal.o%5Crg\">HERE</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pashupati-Tents.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pashupati-Tents.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\nHOWEVER, the PEOPLE THEMSELVES are begging for corrugated iron sheets instead of tents. They can use the rubble from the earthquake and build shelters if they have the corrugated iron sheets, AND the iron sheets will last for DECADES and can be the first piece of their new home when they rebuild after the monsoon season, in the fall. Here is a photo of how the iron sheets can be creatively used to create superior shelters:\n\nThe corrugated iron is much more expensive than tents, but the people know what they need much better than we do because they are the ones who need to live in their own situation. We need to change all of our fund-raising appeals to corrugated iron,\u00a0and we need to find a cheap source of he iron sheets.... VERY CHEAP! Below cost would be ideal. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE NEEDING ADEQUATE SHELTER TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE MONSOONS, and one tarp per family, while it is IMPORTANT and better than nothing, will be totally INADEQUATE all by itself. I sent a letter to a big steel company, but I have not heard back yet.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sindhupalchok-4.jpg\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sindhupalchok-4.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\nMeanwhile, Madhav is scouring the countryside for ANY possible lead on whom to contact, and what to do, to get into our share of the AID sent from around the world so that we can distribute it to the suffering people.\n\nSO our current activity consists of CONNECTING INTO the official network of aid, which has been very difficult to locate in the confusion, and collecting money for shelter for the thousands of homeless people in the Sindhulpachok district.\u00a0\n\nMadhav went to a SHELTER CLUSTER CONTACT meeting yesterday and made important connections with the people who are sending aid to the nearest city in Sindhulpachok District to the isolated people we are talking about.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1507989_897830023611438_7345800621692591742_n.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1507989_897830023611438_7345800621692591742_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></a>\n\nIT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THIS AND OTHER MEETINGS RESULT IN AID TO THE HOMELESS, AND ARE <strong>NOT JUST A LOT OF TALK</strong>!\n\nThe United Nations and the Nepali Government have set up separate \"clusters of contacts\" for each of the different types of aid, such as SHELTER CLUSTER, FOOD CLUSTER, MEDICAL CLUSTER, LOGISTICS CLUSTER, etc. The clusters all have SEPARATE meetings and are also divided by the area of Nepal that they are intended to serve. It is a complicated system, and I am studying the internet documents as quickly as I can understand the interwoven information, so that I have been able to give Madhav contact and meeting information for the SHELTER, FOOD, and MEDICAL clusters. He is an extremely capable leader, and we are hoping that his influence in the meetings will open the floodgates of aid to the people in the isolated villages in Sindhulpachok, many of whom have not yet received one biscuit of aid.\n\nFinally,you can see below\u00a0the extreme difficulty of getting ANY type of aid into the area . It is a small photo, but it really shows what people have to do to bring anything up into the high country where some villages are more than a day's TREK straight up the mountain! It is very important that Madhav knows the communities and is already a community leader there, in addition to his leadership duties in Lalitpur and Kathmandu. His knowledge and expertise are needed to get the aid in to the people who need it.\n\nIt is POSSIBLE that we may be able to schedule one or more helicopter drop-offs, but that will involve Madhav attending the next LOGISTICS CLUSTER meeting to learn about the extensive paperwork that the logistics cluster requires.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1Sindhulpachowk-1.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1Sindhulpachowk-1.jpg\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1Sindhulpachowk-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 213px;\"></a>\n\n<em><strong>NAMASTE!!</strong></em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-16 10:41:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.818617", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1960, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25426, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5617, "post_number": 8, "raw": "ping -\u00a0@Costantino /\u00a0@lakomaa\n\nDo you think it would take much time to prepare it ?\n\nWould we need a lot of gear ?\n\nHow could we proceed ?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-20 09:19:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.496606", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25143], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20974, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 2046, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi! \u00a0:- )\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<span>Ok.\u00a0</span>If I can help,\u00a0let me know!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-15 10:09:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.719818", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17473, "user_id": 472, "topic_id": 1271, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\nThanks John,\n\nNow I have a better vision of Spanish youth (in political area).\n\nThe <a href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_15-M\"><strong>Indignados Movement</strong></a> has shown that Spanish youth have political interest, an interest in order to improve our society.\n\nSo, I think OpenGov concept has a good future.\n\nI hope see you in this future :)\n\nRegards.\n\nPS: We need to (re)start the \"Gobierno Abierto\" group in GovInTheLab.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-09 23:56:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:37.504862", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 91, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27740, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4576, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>It's difficult b/c it's complex, but it does not have to be \u2026</b>\n\nI wonder why people prefer these complex conflicts to simple solutions \u2026 .

Say \u201cWe can help you achieve this\u201d or something in that direction.\u00a0\n\nThen, I would go straight to the examples, they make the statements \u201c<i>teaching people collaboration and effective use of open technologies\u201d </i>and <i>\u201cbuilding a culture and workflow based on openness.\u201d </i>a lot more concrete! Maybe even spend a bit more space on explaining what these two statements mean/what they look like.\u00a0\n\nAfter slide 9 (\u201cMake culture with people, not just for people\u201d) I would put the offer. Only then the reader has a clear image of what The Culture Squad/Edge Thinking actually is.\u00a0\n\nSlide 10 (\u201cEdgeRyders is\u201d) looks quite similar to slide 9, which creates some noise. Maybe use the space to define the difference between The Culture Squad and EdgeRyders. The title is quite a hard one to understand, maybe simplify that by simply stating what the sheet is about: \u201cAbout EdgeRyders\u201d.\n\nOn a final note: have a look at <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6ci8Ahg2QbBR1MtQmNnOTNrZGM\">this pitch</a> of Duch platform City Challenges.

Even though I am not being paid to work on it anymore, I find myself spending time on the website and interacting\u00a0with members of the community in various ways. And it's not just me. There are many signs of<span>\u00a0a powerful story unfolding: people around us treat Edgeryders as if it were a reality \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2013/03/22/puo-un-hacker-farsi-monaco-si-accade-nei-sassi-di-matera-con-il-progetto-europeo-un-monastery_n_2931132.html\">Huffington Post</a>\u00a0to the many people and entities that offered help, free venues for future \\#LOTEs and so on. Nadia pulled off an amazing stunt, getting Swedish think tank Global Challenge to pay Edgeryders (which does not even exist!)\u00a0for the <a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to/327-the-baltic\">Mission: Baltic</a> gig. And of course the amazingly high-quality conversation on this website (that runs on community-donated time and money) is the strongest sign of all that there is something valuable in our staying close.</span>\n\nI think we might have a credible product for a social enterprise. In a nutshell, it's this: we know how to produce\u00a0a new kind of knowledge product. You can think of it as a hybrid between consultancy and consultation. Like consultancy, it is as technical and narrow-scoped as required: there are citizen experts on everything out there, and the Internet (and our own community-building skills) makes it cheap to reach out to them). Like consultation, it is open to everyone and scales quite well. <em>Unlike</em> run-of-the-mill\u00a0consultancy, our method:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>is self-correcting</strong>. Radical openness guarantees that, if a particular group of citizen experts takes a wrong turn, their mistake is likely to be spotted and corrected early on by others \u2013 just like what happens with open source software.</li>\n\n<li><strong>is truthful</strong>. For almost all participants being a citizen expert is not a job \u2013 although it can occasionally lead to paid work \u2013 and there are too many of us to buy us all off. This takes away the incentive to keep the client away from inconvenient truths.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nEven more important than a model, we have great, world-class people in the community. I can think of at least half a dozen of the \"young guns\" in Edgeryders that I would definitely make a project with. And \u2013 as agreed in Brussels last December \u2013\u00a0the young guns have the support of the older\u00a0Edgeryders who are too deep into their own things to want to build another company themselves, but will play ball (and bring along invaluable expertise) if the young people make the first move and build space for them.\u00a0\n\nIf I am right, I would very much like us to morph into a social enterprise, because this would kill several birds with one stone. It would give a natural point of entry for \"people on the edge\" to interact with the policy making process, strengthening our democracy;\u00a0generate the revenue to keep the community together and keep it growing (maintain a website, have people paid to explore the planet for more people riding the edge to join forces with, pay for a\u00a0#LOTE conference\u00a0each\u00a0year); and\u00a0produce some paid work for, well, you guys, and even a couple of jobs.\u00a0So, with Nadia's help and inspiration, I developed a pitch for potential clients and gave it at <a href=\"/t/you-the-expert-an-invitation-to-stockholm/959\">the Stockholm seminar</a> last week. The slides are at the top of this post.\n\nThe day after, we met with fellow Edgeryders present at the seminar in a sun-washed cafe in SoderMalm \u2013 and we agreed that the pitch has traction, and that we have in Nadia a powerful saleswoman. We also discussed various ways to make this idea attractive and fair to the whole community: I will write about this in a forthcoming post. I am very aware that making Edgeryders a business, even a social one, might shatter the sense of community. We all agreed that there is no way this is going to work without the active support of the community.\n\nE<span>ncouraged by\u00a0</span>Alek Tarkowski, Nadia entered Edgeryders in the Knight Foundation's Open Government Challenge. It would be nice to win, of course, but that was not the point: the point was, rather, to continue developing the idea and give it a written form. Now that it's written, I would like to ask you all for feedback. <strong>What do you think? Can it work? Would you like to be involved?

But at some point many people have 2 friends within their group who share that specific opinion. Most of these friends also have\u00a0some\u00a0connections who share this opinion - and thus a network (a pretty much endless cluster) has appeared.</em>\n\n<em>If people know whom of their friends share this opinion and it is something they are passionate about, then a lot of things can change pretty drastically in a short time for a society. How much it will change, will often depend on how long the quality of the connection remains \"high\" - even when you have to connect through several friends of friends.</em>\n\n<em>Societal dynamics can flip, even though there may only be a tiny increase of people with their opinion (or just a change in\u00a0their\u00a0awareness/paradigm/narrative) - and they remain a very small minority. If they are in touch through an unbroken connection and can coordinate (propagate signals), they have reached what can be called tipping point, or percolation threshold.</em>\n\n<em>What is required for this is not even necessarily making any sort of addition - only some re-arrangement that allows individuals (or groups) with shared interest to find and coordinate over long distances. And if one has seen this work a few times [well known examples] it can become a powerful self fulfilling prophecy - hardly possible to turn the wheel back on this.</em>\n\nI was reading and some hidden association kept firing off. Finally localised it to this video.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/hwlqUremx4Y\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo is the analysis about identifying hidden/less obvious shared interests between different people, projects, organisations, issues, struggles, resources and windows of opportunity?

However not all these ninety people are moving right away to the transitional CENTRE once its established, The idea is to have the thirty women get set up like homestead not just sitting but try to learn what they could have lost twenty years ago And the reason is we wouldn\u2019t want to be taken by surprise like the war happened since there is already a serious signal that people must leave the internally displaced persons camp here at the Kireka suburb which is just few meters to the city CENTRE, the portion has already been sold to the developer and it\u2019s just a matter of time-boom to explode. If by the Grace of God it explodes when the thirty women are already at the centre with few or more activities taking place, the other Sixty six extended families would have easily find their ways to a place they already know.\n\nHealth wise, I strongly say that all the people we are talking about here are in good health and able to walk the usual African distances but health is not what anyone can guarantee, people fall sick now and then and medication is what is always needed in a community like one we are discussing about. For the food bit of, we had thought the women would improvise as an individual and \u00a0\u00a0as part of their contribution to this strategy though as community we would also have some incentive to this cause. \u00a0I can say that apparently there is no good source of water but these are one of the things we are to survey where we intend to put the transitional CENTRE in and Grace is already up in the North survey such. So this is just a good question to navigate through.\n\nI think you are just right to get to know about the idea. The 60 round trips are basically shall be women\u2019s movements from the city where they are soon going to be displaced from to where we intend to put the transitional CENTRE. Remember the other sixty six family members could be still in the city to cause these movements until finally they are settled. May be to avoid many trips, this is what we can advised on and I do believe is the reason we need every one\u2019s input to make things work.\n\nLand, there are available pieces of land that Grace has identified strategically centered for better linkages of women \u00a0to their home villages where they intend to move to.

Transaction volume is tricky - and often so is invisible work. This is particularly the case with intellectual effort - whether it's developing a program or writing a press release. <u>After</u> the product is created, others look at it and underestimate the intellectual effort that was applied. In many cases they think that the solution (subroutine, strapline, plan, whatever) is obvious - and often it is, <u>after</u> it's been devised.\n\nI suspect that this is the problem that many intensive but time-limited activities like hackathons address successfully. We won't guarantee to solve your problem - we will devote 48 intensive hours to addressing it.\n\nThe \"what are you going to do for me?\" question is interesting. At Access Space we have some people who are, apparently, time-sinks. They constantly ask for help, and seem, sometimes, to give little in return. My view is to have faith, and to ration the tempo of giving to a level that's sustainable and managable. \"I can't necessarily fix your computer, but I can spend 10 minutes pointing you in the right direction.\"\n\nThis said, we've found that eventually, this help pays off. Sometimes it can be as simple as someone expressing the value of the support we've given in a public forum. Genuine gratitude may take years to manifest into returned value... But I find that eventually it almost always does. (Sorry, I am lapsing into philospohy here.)\n\nLocality is an issue - but we're finding that there's a \"virtual locality\" in the global community of hackspaces and fablabs. Yesterday we had a guy walk in from a Bagdhad Hackspace - and he was completely relaxed about asking us for help and advice, chatting with us, and proposing all sorts of future interactions. This is cool, because all of these community spaces are really quite informationally close - even if we're geographically distant.\n\nAnother issue to also address is valuation - sometimes people who have acquired a certain level of technical knowhow (I even include myself in this category) can underestimate the value of skills and approaches which are completely alien to them.\n\nCreative and social insights can unlock ideas, insights, connections and relationships - both with individuals and with organisations. We never saw the expertise of one young man (with a low level of literacy, and a history of petty crime) until some troublesome teenagers came into Access Space. He wasn't able to fix a computer, or program an app, or debug a spreadsheet - but he was able to communicate with a bunch of feral kids in the right way to recruit them as helpful participants, rather than criminal elements. Now, one of those kids he involved is a peer advocate, training to be a youth worker - and he's a key advocate for Access Space - when previously he was just a problem. The ability to build that communication bridge was a key skill that none of the others of us had. It's easy to underestimate the value of these things.\n\nI guess another problem is <em>you get what you're given</em>, which isn't necessarily <em>what you need</em>. Unless you take the approach \"Whatever you're given is what you need\". This is deep philosophy. Enough already. And many apologies to the rest of Edgeryders for transforming this thread into a forum for my philosophical meanderings.\n\nAll the best,\n\nJames\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-31 16:06:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.892402", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 606, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11277, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2835, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I would support this</b>\n\nWith <a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>\u00a0we can take care of the bureaucratic interface.

Also, a conversation between 2 is run differently than between 3 - and my gut feel is that it may be helpful in this case. If I remember correctly the Netherlands have a law that says (in some sectors) you are not allowed to work alone (for safety reasons). But it may pay off in other places as well. Overhead is to a large degree a question of effective management (unfortunately seems to be at least partially sucked into the (academic) economics clusterf***). In other words, I don't want anyone to picture clean handed, tie wearing, people external to the process, who claim to be managers or consultants.\n\nAnother advantage for groups of 3 is that with two connections you are more likely to get a linear info spread which is very fragile (weakest link). If the info spreads through a highly branched and connected structure - (some of) it is more likely to get to point B. Also it'll morph differently along different routes - both a blessing and a curse. But if the raw data is kept, it is mostly helpful and enlightening. Thus my preference of groups of 3, one junior (most active), one senior (moderates junior, and encourages:), one (or two) beginners (helps with simple stuff, asks questions about complex stuff, makes sure documentation is there and useful, and substitutes for junior if one is needed). That way you can build a (widening) talent pipeline, and spread work and info effectively.\n\nIdeally I managed/supported multiple projects to have them complement each other in different phases and have people inverse roles when contributing to such a related project (senior in mature project -&gt; hops into beginner role in a supporting or sequel-project). If possible I liked to split projects into a couple of self similar phases with different scale and emphasis. Each phase would typically break down ino: dream, work, triage &amp; assess. For advanced technology demonstrator type work I liked a relatively intensive dream-stage (experts &amp; beginners separate, then mixed, borrow some people) that would also be relatively detailed in the end - to be able to forecast requirements for the critical backbone. If time is short I would start the alpha version (the fast, sloppy, and a the edges) staggered but essentially parallel to the first beta version (balanced performance with reliability). In the alpha version you do \"dump-documentation\" that has a lot of data but little structure. Alpha is half expected to fail/burst into flames before assessment is fully completed to see how-low-can-you-go (la-la-lalala-lala) on error margins. This informs the progressive elaboration of the beta version. If things work well in the first iteration, you do a second one to see if it <em>was </em>luck, and focus on documentation - cause you're probably onto a good solution. If you kind of missed your aims, you check if it is possible to dream up good aims that fit what you made. Usually though you will feel that you're on the right path, but it just needs more work. A <em>lot </em>more work. If that doesn't seem to help you probably need to ramp up assessment and spread it throughout the project. Each new iteration is a good opportunity to bring in new people (and also let a few go). I would not want to make a lot of <em>strict</em> rules though. I'd rather welcome the opportunity to point out the difference between an \"excuse\" and a \"good excuse\". This all however is based on technical projects that are probably some of the easiest to handle in principle. If you have strong outside influences (seasons) or complex living things (social aspects) to consider, this shoe would probably not fit on every hand...\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-30 13:37:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.987374", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 654, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27680], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16302, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3388, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Tickets are actually worth more than 1000 usd,</b>\n\n1350.

The fruits can be harvested by the communities \u2013 a Raspberry Pi is simply a low-power computer with storage space that we will fill with useful data for offline use: Wikipedia, open-source books on education and disaster-response, audiobooks, useful contacts, entertainment for kids and so on.\n\nData will be accessible for everyone with a basic smartphone, not requiring Internet connectivity. The content, along with the size of the storage, can be easily updated.\n\nThese digital fruits provide various improvements to well-being: instant and constant improved access to information, better knowledge of English, influx of innovative ideas around construction and farming, you name it.\n\n<strong>Detailed project</strong>\n\nIn rural Nepal, many citizens own the tools for accessing and processing information and data: a smartphones, and enough electricity to recharge it. What\u2019s missing is the actual information: mobile Internet can\u2019t provide anything but the most essential pieces, since it\u2019s slow, intermittent and spotty (or completely absent).\n\nWe think that the missing ingredient in this scenario are cheap, low-power, zero-maintenance media servers, providing huge offline datasets to wi-fi equipped smartphones, tablets and other computers. Such a server costs less than 80 USD and provides the equivalent to a library with thousands of books.\n\nThe exact content of the servers would be decided together with the villages who want such a server, and can always be extended later. However, here are our initial ideas of what to include:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Basic instruction sheets and videos.</strong> Covering hygiene, nutrition, disaster preparedness, risk reduction, disaster response and basic medicine.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Audiobooks.</strong> For people with limited literacy, audio is more appropriate content. Raspberry Pi servers allow audio streaming and downloads over wi-fi, and smartphones can be used to access both. for both. Apps for this would also be provided on the server.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Offline Wikipedia.</strong> All Wikipedia articles in English and Nepali. The storage space need is around 10 GiB for a compressed archive without images, and more when including selected, downscaled images.</li>\n\n<li><strong>E-Library.</strong> An open source library with e-books about agriculture, sustainable construction, medical help, handicrafts, technology maintenance and repair and various appropriate technology topics.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Educational materials.</strong> Including e-books for school and \u201cfun stuff\u201d like novels, instructional books etc. made specially for children. Also including language courses with textual and audio content and ideally a special app to support learning.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Yellow Pages.</strong> A list of important contacts and places \u2013 such as hospitals, schools, municipal offices, with phone numbers and addresses and a search to find the nearest ones.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Maps of Nepal.</strong> Integrating an OpenStreetMap website incl. tile server, OpenStreetMap offline data for download and use in OSMAnd~, and several PDF maps.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Android apps.</strong> Repository of free software Android applications. Basically an offline version of <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/\">f-droid.org</a>. Allows extended use of smartphones without Internet access.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe maintenance required for the local media servers is updating its datasets every once in a while. Developing an efficient system for this will require a bit of custom development effort. In total, this and other \u201cspecial features\u201d of the local media servers that need some development effort are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Internet-to-thumbdrive full downloads.</strong> To make obtaining the initial dataset very comfortable, all datasets should be available for combineddownload from a single place on the Internet. Legally this is not a problem, since only open source / open content datasets will be used.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Internet-to-thumbdrive updates.</strong> To update a USB thumbdrive to the latest version of data (for taking it to villages and updating data there later), one would plug it into a computer and run Windows-based software from the thumbdrive that updates its data from Internet download sources. Even in places with (some) Internet access, updating gigabytes of data is slow and potentially expensive, so this process should be as bandwidth-efficient as possible.

I'm coming from this <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/community-heroes/mission_case/what-do-you-want-new-edgeryders-platform-software\">discussion of the new software features</a>, and while it's really creative and inspiring we're currently stuck because we realized that, before dicussing features, we need an agreed-upon vision (aka: priorities, paradigm) for the new project, and hence, the new software. The big idea. It seems here's the place to discuss that.\n\nFrom that background, I still have basic questions about the new project:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Could you publish these \"40+ main points and details concerning the new process\" you mentioned? As that seems to be the project's boundaries, including the \"technical details concerning the web development, software and communication\".</li>\n\n<li>Are the 30 European cities that will take part in this project already selected? If not, what's the process for it?</li>\n\n<li>How do we know we succeeded to tackle \"social exclusion, precariousness and poverty\" in these 30 places? Some metrics from the SPIRAL project maybe? Is success measured at all, and if yes, does it fit into the big idea if the software keeps track of it?</li>\n\n<li>From the past meetings and the Edgeryders 1.0 context, how do you folks intend the Edgeryders 2.0 platform user's experience to be? Because to me, that seems to be a good way to grasp the \"big idea\" for the new software. I'm asking for both the users' feelings and activities (s)he can do there. So for example, is it more about the emotional support in a \"love and trust\" environment that Andrei mentions, or more about heavy action for \"creating common goods\"?)</li>\n\n</ul>Let me put it straight: I'm quite frightened by what it means, software-wise, to include all these \"citizens, organizations, businesses and institutions\", with a project or not, whether they come or we have to look for them. That would mean pretty much everybody, right? Now a software to help everybody can have no specialized features for nobody. That all-purpose software is basically like a word processor, which you can use for everything from invoices to novels and newspapers, but it's the optimum for exactly none of these. So for us tech folks to come up with great features, we need a more specific vision than \"bring everybody together and fight social exclusion, precariousness and poverty\". That's why I ask for the 40+ process details and other material that can inform the software design process.\n\nBefore reading this mission report, I had the impression that Edgeryders 2.0 is about connecting and supporting existing local self-help projects in these 30 cities, inspiring new ones like them, and bringing their issues also to the policy level. Something like that is workable for designing a specialized software around it. If it is much broader, the only thing software can offer is being an all-purpose communication tool. Think a meshup of a forum, social network, resource directory and map. But there would not be specialized features which are only relevant for some people, like a <a href=\"#comment-4248\">how-to wizard</a> for actionable local project instructions.\n\nThinking about this again, the \"all-purpose communication tool\" idea is not bad either. Very reusable. But anyway, we have to know what kinda software we should create ;-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-15 19:30:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.160750", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 589, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 531, "user_id": 3398, "topic_id": 498, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The vision of Families of Color Seattle (FOCS) is that our children of color are born into a loving community that is racially and economically just. To work towards this, FOCS\u2019 mission is to build a strong community by supporting families of color through parenting programs, resource sharing and fostering meaningful connections. For example, programs include regular parenting groups led by trained parent facilitators of color, multi-cultural art classes for kids and adults, and community events and resources on relevant topics for families of color. FOCS is unique in providing safe spaces where families of color can build community with a focus on race, identity, culture and ethnicity through a lens of social and racial justice. \u00a0Since our founding in 2013, FOCS has evolved into an active base of over 1000 interethnic, intercultural families of color in South Seattle and the greater Seattle/King County area in Pacific Northwest of United States of America. .\n\nBorn out of the desire for alternatives to mainstream parenting groups, FOCS tackles serious challenges head on. There is a lack of effective opportunities for community dialogues on race and family. Culturally-relevant and multiracial parenting resources are unknown or unwritten. Mainstream organizations aren\u2019t committed to anti-racist policies and practices for our children of color. And families of color seek a safe community where shared experiences and cultural understanding are the norm.\n\nToday, FOCS is a nonprofit organization led by women of color including the Executive Director and Founder Amy Pak as well as FOCS\u2019 7-member board of directors. Prior to incorporation, core volunteers dedicated hundreds of hours to evolve and solidify the needs of our community based on what we\u2019d be hearing from our families. We have grown from an all-volunteer start-up group to one that is led by .5 FTE staff, 2 interns, 1 Rainier Valley Corps Fellow, professional and diverse Board of directors and hundreds of dedicated family volunteers. It is critical to us that FOCS employs and utilizes the assets of our parents of color network for \u201cpeer to peer\u201d learning and sharing. This builds strong community and ensures our voices are lifted up and valued. \u00a0\n\nSince 2013, 30 parent groups have been organized, providing weekly support and reduced social isolation for over 180 parenting group participants. FOCS ARTS cultural arts programming has engaged over 800 families in fun, interactive, multicultural learning opportunities. The FOCS online community forum involves resources sharing between over 430 families of color. \u00a0In 2015-16, FOCS successfully executed five dialogues in Seattle around issues of equity on race/multiracial identity, anti-bias education, reproductive justice, and transracial adoption and included a total of 500 people and 75 volunteers. Our reach is wide and it is getting stronger. FOCS was recently awarded the Ron Chisom Anti-Racism Award by the Seattle Services Coalition for our work in racial justice for families. The ceremony was June 1,2016 at City Hall, Seattle.\n\nFOCS, a non-profit, was eventually founded in 2013 and it is now a women-led organization which connects parents and builds a loving community of families of color in Seattle. We\u2019ve discovered a growing demand from families of color, young parents, transracial adoptive families, multi-national,, multiracial families growing in Seattle, yet the city remains 70% white with growing displacement of families of color, immigrant and low income communities not being able to afford America\u2019s city with the quickest rising cost of living in the nation. Seattle also boosts America\u2019s largest multi-racial identifying people and also reflects where children of color are the majority nationally in Kindergarten. \u00a0FOCS fosters meaningful connects, engages parents and children with cultural arts, but also providing a platform where they can discuss everything, from returning work to breastfeeding, race, community, identity and social justice. It\u2019s a powerful combination of professions, education, traditions and backgrounds. Our impact has been deep and quick, we have connected over 1000 families and trained and employed more than 35 parents as Parent Educators and Teaching Artists.\n\nFOCS initially opened <a href=\"https://www.parentmap.com/article/new-community-play-space-in-south-seattle-cornerstone-cafe\">Cornerstone Cafe</a> in Fall of 2014. The space offered a drop-in child care, and a cultural arts program including capoeira and Hawaiian and Spanish talk story. We now operate FOCS ARTS cultural arts programming for 0-7 year olds with parents each week, facilitate community dialogues on race and family, parenting groups for newborns and waddlers and consult and provide race and equity workshops for parents and educators at preschools and elementary schools.\n\nWe became part of commuinity led de-gentrification of South Seattle, where our community resources reflect the historical community of residents. Instead, FOCS members are connected by the culture of inclusivity, community building and play-centered learning. Our values are women of color and mother leadership, racial equity, economic impact, dismantling racism, education equity, and an intercultural interethnic community. We envision a world where children of color are born into a loving community that is racially and economically just.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne Filipina American mother of mixed race Filipino, Salvadorian and White two young boys said about FOCS,\n\n\u201cI gave birth to my first son in 2010. My pregnancy was difficult, it was unplanned, my relationship was unstable, my partner was unemployed and I suffered internal bleeding during the first trimester resulting in an emergency surgery; I often cried during my prenatal appointments, and the midwives expressed concern that I was at risk for post-partum depression and they recommended joining a parent group when my baby arrived to build a supportive community. My son arrived 3 weeks early and the birth was long and ended in a c-section. When my baby arrived I continued to face difficulty. My son was very small but healthy, but he failed to gain weight as I was unable to produce the milk he needed, and he rarely slept more than 2 hours at a time for nearly the first 6 months of his life. I had never felt more scared, tired, or overwhelmed. After 6 months I went back to my midwife with signs of Postpartum Depression and worked with my health care providers and my partner on a plan to help me manage my symptoms and the stressors in my life.\n\nLooking back through this experience what was missing from my life was an opportunity to build authentic relationships and community with other mothers. I was part of a parent group, but never felt like I could be myself in these groups and share what was going on in mothering experience and within myself. I often felt lonely and isolated even in the presence of the group. I attribute this experience to having a space where both mothers and partners were included as well as the facilitation of the group which focused primarily on the baby and not on the identity or needs of the parent. When I joined a FOCS (Families of Color Seattle) group last Spring, after the birth of my second son, I knew I found the place I had yearned for earlier in my motherhood. The circumstances with the birth of my second were entirely different so I was in a better place emotionally, physically, and financially, but I know that every mother still needs support and community.\n\nWhat I found with FOCS was an intentional space to build authentic relationships and community. As mothers we are welcomed in and acknowledged as whole people with cultures, professions, fears and passions, not just as care taker of a child. FOCS openly discusses and acknowledges race, ethnicity, culture, language, and identity and its importance in motherhood, parenting, and raising children. In my experience these topics were left out of other traditional parenting groups in the community. When these topics are left out, people of color and their experiences are neglected and excluded. When FOCS brings our multiple identities to the forefront the result is more authentic conversation and relationship building. My first year with my second son has been extremely positive and I attribute much of this to my on-going connection with FOCS. I felt supported as an individual and mother, and was able to transfer the love I felt to the love I share with my child. It is so important to provide support for mothers so that we can be better mothers. I believe that the strength of the community that is being built is a testimony of the need that families of color in Seattle are looking for spaces to connect\".\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-07 07:10:21", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:08:13.127062", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1481, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20897, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3622, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I have the information from Robin Chase, do I pass them to Matera now? @Ben @Alberto\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-24 10:28:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.267002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4462, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4429, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/icon/27333/download-options/\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/36a9f2f522402e7fa48200d4a58df1759b717af0.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\"><br></a>\n\n<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.2000007629395px; line-height: 32.6400032043457px;\">In order to develop consistency across the different Case Study stories collected we use the following shared framework.</strong><span>***</span>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Format</h2>\n\nEach asking the same set of questions.\u00a0\n\nEach video/audio recording should also contain an addition 5-10 minutes free form conversation by the interviewee.\u00a0\n\nThe video/audio should be uploaded into the edgeryders vimeo/soundcloud account, then embedded in a written post summarising the main points from the interview, as well as the author's reflections.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Questions</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Tell me/us about your project/work?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How you got started and current situation</li>\n\n<li>Who's involved: \u00a0Who is in the team?

And it is very hard to be good at everything. During \\#lote3 (last year's edition of the Edgeryders big annual community event) a room full of people building inspiring projects said they could really use help with design and communication. Plus many of us simply prefer getting on with the work we are passionate about, rather than promoting our projects, or even ourselves.\n\n<span>Public recognition is important if nothing else because it makes our work and ideas accessible to others and opens new opportunities. Also, we all need to generate revenue and getting the word out about what we offer to people who might be interested is crucial.\u00a0Most of us are short on time and cannot afford to hire communications agencies or staff.</span>\u00a0\n\nBut we happily contribute towards supporting one another if someone is coordinating and making it easy, fun and meaningful to do it.\n\nWe do it all the time: When was the last time you shared a funny or beautiful photo or video online? Or an interesting article/blogpost? Exactly.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Session Format</h3>\n\nThis session consists of a short presentation followed by a hands on workshop. The aim is to go from inspiration, discussion, brainstorming and execution in one afternoon. So we have actually built something together by the time we leave for dinner!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Equipment</h3>\n\nPlease bring an HD camera if you have it, as well as a stand. Don't forget to bring your laptop if you have it!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">I need help with....</h3>\n\nIf you know friends who are good graphic designers or web developers, and want to learn about using social media effectively, bring them along. It will be a fun and rewarding experience for all of us!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Want to submit your project as a case study?</h3>\n\nTell us about you and your work in arrivals. If the description is detailed enough, we may pick up your project as one of the case studies we will be working on in the session.\n\nWhy is this good?

There were three lads living there already - Kieron, Dave and Billy. Kieron was the leader. He had a drill. Billy was very pale and very thin - kind of morose somehow while at the same time desperately optimistic. He looked like he hadn't seen a vitamin in months. Dave on the other hand, was just mad. At this point, quite obviously, even certifiably, mad. Just a week or so before he had actually escaped from the psychiatric hospital over the road, bringing to mind a scene from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. And over the course of our time together, Dave told me a few stories about that place, that enlightened paragon of metal health provision which had held him body and soul for all of nine months. He told me how he preferred prison, because at least in prison you got a release date. He told me about the electric shock therapy, which left your mind totally scrambled for two or three days, then left you feeling more or less ok for two or three days but with no memory, after which they did it all over again. He told me about being chained to four big guys who were there to 'look after him', even when he went to the toilet. About how if he didn't go along with something that they wanted him to do, sooner or later he'd get held down and recieve a knock-out shot delivered to his buttock, which resulted in unconsciousness and a noticeable reduction in his ability to stand up for his rights. Essentially, he didn't have any rights. He was mad. They could do whatever they wanted to him. The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I'm not so sure I believe them. Dave's approach was to break out of the place and find himself a squat to live in with a couple of mates and several total strangers, one of whom had been recognised by Kieron from a free party, when they bumped into each other down at the job centre. Its amazing what gets hatched down at the job centre, and I'm not talking about anyone finding a job. But anyway, when we turned up at the squat, Dave was living on the sofa in the lounge in a haze of ashtray cigarettes and cheap cider, eyeing the curtains nervously and never far away from a large knife. You got the feeling he was pretty keen never to go back inside that place if there was anything he had to say about it. And he wasn't leaving the house, or even that room much at this time. Absconders from mental health institutions tend to be automatically served with arrest warrants by the local magistrates, and I don't suppose that was helping his mental health any either. Dave seemed to be doing pretty well as far as I could see, considering everything that he'd gone through so far in his life. He told me his Dad was always drunk and often violent. He said his mother had been killed, shot by a farmer standing in front of her dog trying to protect him while out for a walk. That was when he left home. He'd had a job as the look-out for a gang of thieves that robbed industrial units at the age of nine. A little later he'd gone to live with a family of Irish travellers who'd trained him to be a bareknuckle boxer, a discipline at which he was apparently quite talented. Some time after that he'd bought a house, back when they gave mortgages to people with no job, no credit rating and no intention whatsoever to make even a single repayment. That episode lasted a few months, during which time he acquired an addiction to crack and heroin, or 'brown n white' as it was known on the estate. That was when the mental health issues really kicked in. I could sometimes see the different personalities fighting for control inside Dave's head. So much suffering just couldn't be contained inside one self-image, so the ever resourceful ego just created a couple of others to help take the strain. I think it was fair to say that Dave was feeling the pressure. And of course, he couldn't go to get any medication, because he knew the Doctor would just arrange to have him arrested as soon as he arrived at his appointment. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">On the one hand, Kieron and Billy were quite happy to have Dave and his knives living on the sofa. After all, this was a squat, and you never know what might go down. Sometimes you have to defend a place, and while Kieron liked his drill, that was about the limit of his handiness. And if anything serious went off you'd most likely find Billy in a cupboard. So Dave had his uses. And anyway, they were mates. But in this condition, he wasn't exactly easy company. So naturally, Billy and Kieron started to pal up a little. They shared a floor in the house with a kitchen in it, they went outside from time to time. They liked to get stoned together, and have a laugh. But this was unsettling to Dave somehow. He'd been mates with Billy for years, since the time he bought the house. He had no family left, no real friends after all the alcoholism, the drugs, the crime, and the madness. Billy was about all he had. And now he was feeling him drifting away. It all came to a head one full moon. It 'd been building for a while. You could feel it all through the house, under the neon strip lights in the corridors. Tension. The more Dave got wound up, the more Kieron and Billy retreated into their little flat. Sometimes you could hear him shouting incoherently in the lounge on his own. It wasn't very reassuring. But on this particular night, we found him shouting slightly more coherently, and it wasn't at himself. It was directed at Kieron. Dave was pacing the lounge, muttering to himself, wild-eyed. Then suddenly, something snapped. He grabbed his largest knife from under the cushions of the sofa</font><font size=\"3\"> and stormed out in the direction of the stairs. Larissa, sharp as ever, phoned Kieron fast and told him to lock his door. She was just in time. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'Yer fuckin big gay bastard! Open t'door.' </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'Fuck off Dave' said Kieron, with his foot set hard against the door to keep his demented friend from getting in. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">It wasn't looking good. Dave was stabbing the door repeatedly with his enormous blade, while Kieron, who fortunately for him liked to eat a hearty meal, was leaning against it with all his weight. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'Open t'door or I'll fookin kill yer both'</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">If I open t'door, that's when you'll fookin kill us both, was more what it looked like. </font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">The rest of us were gathering downstairs in the lounge. We'd known these people a week, and this was the only place we had to live. We were not ecstatic about the situation. And besides, we were worried, as much for Dave as for Kieron and Billy. We really liked Dave. He was a lovely lad, underneath all the addictive behaviour, the paranoia and the threat of imminent violence. I'd had a good connection with him from the start. We both had Irish ancestry. We shared a dark sense of humour. Dave's kind of funny was to make unbelievably hot curries, knowing that Billy didn't like them, but that he had no money and that there was no other food in the house. And then to watch Billy eating them, as his face got redder and redder, and his expressions grew ever more absurd. That was like Dave's perfect joke. So anyway, I headed up the stairs, with Dom close behind. The stairwell was pulsating, neon, harsh light. Nowhere to hide. Kieron's door was closed now, with the giant knife stuck in it, wobbling, and Dave half-shouting half-sobbing, desperately scared of losing his friend, his mind, his freedom. I wondered about his family history, and how much comprehension he had of his own emotional reality. It can't have been easy for him. And I thought about my own safety. But however erratic he'd been acting, I didn't feel any kind of malicious intent would be directed towards me.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'Dave, Dave. Dave man, it's me.'</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">Dave was in his own world, and it was breaking down.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'Dave, what's up man? Why don't you put the knife down?'</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">He kicked the door a couple of times, just desperate now, more than dangerous. My heart broke for him.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'Dave, you're bleeding mate! Look. Let me see that hand.'</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">Dave looked at his palm, which had been cut by the knife as he had rammed it repeatedly into the door. It wasn't serious, but it was badly enough to make a fair mess. The sight of his own blood seemed to bring him back to himself. All the fight had gone out of him now. You could see he was ready to be taken care of.</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">'You should get that seen to Dave. You want me to come with you mate, we'll go down to the A&amp;E dept at the bottom of the road?'</font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font size=\"3\">He let me lead him away, still staring at his bloody palm, and I placed my arm around his shoulders as Dom discretely removed the knife from the door and hid it out of sight. The crisis it seemed, was over. At least for now. But still, we had an evidently pretty broken human being on our hands, and what the hell were we going to do about that? </font>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-08 00:48:50", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:57:39.426064", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2032, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21898, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4571, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Culture in games?</b>\n\nI was writing a somewhat thought out comment, when it was wiped. :(\n\nSo here is the very short version only, fortunately the clips below did not get lost - as they probably do the most effective talking.

Matt has just obtained a token which matches with the token Akul has. The token has an expiry limit: When the token devaluates (Again inflates just like monetary system) the Deal breaks. If the actual product/service is received and the Deal finishes off before the Voucher is anulled, thats an actual Barter in B2C as well. Got the catch?\n\nNow, Matt and Akul are part of a local collaborative platform that does online exchange - digital transactions (You may use your phone for that, Samsung gears or a card -its basically a SaaS running over it)\n\nwhich follows a network bartering mechanism. The Network of Trust based Bartering mechanism rather.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Compute all possible closed loops</li>\n\n<li>offer the user which loops to choose\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>How to devise the rule of choosing networked loops - Compute over all Need based loops and calculate their earlier Social Reputation - A Social Reputation based network is nothing new. Ask the researchers at Multi Swap to work on and refer to Sporas Zacharia algorithm: Refer to Amazon,ebay or any feedback based rating system. My proposal here is based on past histories of trade the 1 to 5 star rating has its flaws - but automated feedback mechanism helps you find the Best Paths out of the closed loops and gives you then the option to continue the flow of trade.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Once users choose their preferred networked paths, the Social Reputation is Proportional to the level of trust: The levle of trust decides the Amt. of Time it will take to Set a Deal Period. Two things\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>If I am in Mexico and you are in Italy - And if shipment will take 10 days while the Deal Period is only 5 days? So Amt of Time and distance as well. I am not sure. I am just brainstorming</li>\n\n<li>The good thing is Business Transactions can be Prioritized because now they know which Deals are FIrst based on the Mutual Level of Social Reputation. SOcial Reputation is computed dynamically and is relative to Peers.</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>Make the Deal and your Voucher = Bill of Transaction starts its countdown. There is no debt here. It is not money. It is just a token.</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>I checked out this gentleman with username - elf or some scandinavian nickname I suppose is contributing to this online marketplace site - sharetribe.com; that could be a good starting point to integrate economy app as the basic engine to run off</li>\n\n<li>While Economy App could use in return, the Reputation calculator mechanism that I offer. You don't need anything more. Just a database I could design and all yoru queries could be called via a json-rpc or i prefer REST bases queries and it will compute over all supplied input users, what is the possible reputation relative to each other.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis way your transaction is digitally PAID &amp; Stored in the Payment Gateway while the Token starts the counter backwards. If Deal is made, the PAID status sets to True. and thats paid. thats about it. no money exchanged actually but its just a Monitor. What that means is unlike current payment exchange like paypal, there is nothing being transffered in a bank account rather when the PAID = True, the token\u00a0expires if its before the actual token deadline.\u00a0Its actually a system to monitor Input and output bound resources across a closed community so you could see its also a resource exchange logger/monitor keeping track of the bartering parties across all existing communities.\n\nPS: Dont use QR. nobody is venturing into it.

A lone female, out in the middle of nowhere during one of the coldest nights in an unusually harsh winter. I had spent hours at a gas station waiting for a lift- there was hardly anyone around. At some point a man stopped to fill his tank and I walked up to him asking if he was heading in the right direction, and if he would be up for giving me a lift. He was very surprised to see me (\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone hitchhiking on this road since the 80s!\u201d) and it was going to be a long boring drive so he agreed.\n\nFor hours we chatted away. I was a lot younger than he was and listened wide-eyed while he told me about his experiences working first as a mechanic, then training as a fighter pilot and how he got fired from his last job as a commercial airline pilot. It was a fascinating story and the world immediately felt much bigger.\n\nAt some point I noticed something shiny in the back seat. It had a jet engine attached and did not look like anything else I\u2019d seen. So I asked him what it was. His response: \u201cI have built jet-powered wings so I can fly like a bird\u201d. Today I was reminded of this special meeting when the above video popped up in my feeds.\n\nWhat really stuck from our four hour long conversation that night is how this journey of his really started.\n\nAlthough Yves had harboured a life-long dream to do this, he only decided to go all in after he was fired from his cushy Swissair pilot job. And only after an initial period of not feeling so great about losing his job (anyone who has ever been fired can tell you it can really screw with your self confidence and sense of self-worth).\n\nThis brings us back to failure. No matter how smart or knowledgeable you are, however well you plan, it\u2019s impossible to go through life without things suddenly taking a turn for the worse at some point. Nassim Taleb wrote a marvelous book about Black Swans, rare events of large magnitude and consequence that cannot be predicted. In it he makes a good point about the futility of trying to predict black swan events, suggesting that a better approach is to build robustness against negative ones that occur and be able to exploit positive ones. This means accepting and preparing for failure as a part of doing, well, anything.\n\nAttempting to get rid of corruption in your country. Building a business. \u00a0Lobbying an organisation to rethink their strategy. Prototyping an idea. Trying to do anything new is setting yourself up to fail. Almost every day. Because the outcomes of our efforts are often unpredictable- especially if we are navigating complex systems.\n\nIf you are determined enough to keep at anything long enough, you may eventually have some successes. But how do you survive all the failures on the path to getting there?\n\nThis is something worth looking into together. Maybe you have to clean someone else's mess up and are looking for new ways of doing it? Maybe you are seeing a massive failure in the making and want to help the people involved to change course? Maybe you have screwed something up and are trying to fix it right now?\n\nWe all have questions to ask our peers, even though it is touchy and a bit scary to \u201cwash the dirty laundry in public\u201d. Not only can it really help us to fix things while they are still salvagable...or limit the damage caused by consequences of failure. \u00a0It also makes you braver: there is something liberating about accepting the worst scenario as a possible outcome of any new endeavor...and then just going ahead and doing it anyway.\n\nYves taught me this many years ago. It has helped me to weather many crises, and to support others in doing the same.\n\n<em>If you want to get involved in exploring this with a diverse community of people from all walks of life come meet us at <strong>Living On The Edge 5: \\#Fail \\#unFail</strong>, a four day get-together focused on failure and how to go beyond it.

Have you considered making a much sorter deliverable that refers to the publication containing the LSP methodology?</li>\n\n<li>Deep Games are described in our proposal as a safe, offline engagement channel. You seem to have decided to make them a prototyping activity. Are we sure about that? Do we need a discussion? Should we move it from WP1 (engagement) to WP3\u00a0(prototyping)?

All activities will be documented, and the documentation (if approved by the focus groups members) will be shared on the platform.\n\nThe aim is to obtain a two-fold return: onboarding of some members of the focus groups, whom will share their experience, and possibly repeat it in different scales and context with other community members; and the ethnographic evaluation of the dynamics and values emerged during the session, which will become available as documentation for the partners.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-26 16:34:38", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:10:59.959496", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 412, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3074], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29131, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 5102, "post_number": 10, "raw": "I just came across <a href=\"http://now-conference.org/about/\">this conference</a> which will be held in Vienna on Jan 21-22.

Which sounds great, but seriously, what the heck does that even mean?\n\nMinerva is a new university that aims to reimagine the paradigm of higher education, based on the science of learning. All classes are seminars, with a flipped classroom structure. Meaning that we students, learn the content on our own and spend time engaging with the deeper concepts behind the material. Moving the emphasis away from the professor teaching and instead towards students learning.\n\nAll of this is facilitated by Minerva\u2019s online platform where all classes take place. Every student (no more than 20 per class) webcams into class, where the platform allows our professors to more easily check how much everyone is participating in the discussion, send us into breakout groups, and live poll the class. Beyond being of instructional benefit, the online format takes away much of the typical costs of facilities development and maintenance that traditional universities place upon their students. Additionally, it allows Minerva to be a genuinely international experience. Our student body is comprised of students from over 40 countries. We live and travel together to seven cities (in as many countries) in cohorts no greater than 150 students. \u00a0\n\nThis unique structure has brought together an amazing community, with potential for changing many of the ways we view higher education. However, there is one factor of higher education that I work most with, and that is students\u2019 mental health and wellness! Minerva students\u2019 have necessarily high work loads, a variety of cultures and constantly transitioning lifestyles, which makes it the perfect edge case to gain insights on how to improve mental health care in universities.\n\n<strong>Accessibility of Resources:</strong>\n\nIn the U.S., a 2014 study found that the average ratio of university mental health professionals to students is about 1:2080. This means that students in need of counseling services face long wait lists and a low amount sessions, resulting in care that is often literally too little too late.\n\nThis has a simple fix: dedicate resources so that students who seek help can get it! The real challenge comes in getting students to value their own well being and to reach out when they feel they need mental support. 80% of students who commit suicide (the second leading cause of university student death) never come into contact with any staff from the counseling center. How do we address these issues?\n\n<strong>The answer is Cultivating Care through Community!</strong>\n\nThis is where my work comes in. As a student working on the school\u2019s mental health team I get work on changes that try and address mental health before it becomes an impediment to education. Currently, I am working on a training for students to learn how to better manage their self care and stress management. Additionally, we are adapting trainings from other universities to include aspects from the science of learning, and create a more lasting impact. A prime example of this is the Student Support Network Training (originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), where students are nominated by their peers to learn how to better understand their own mental health, as well as support friends by caring for them in crisis and connecting to the resource they need.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s no longer enough to focus solely on the counseling department\u2019s efforts to improve students wellness. Our academic team offers periodic sessions with deans and professors to help students improve their writing, time management and other skills that can lead to increased stressed when not appropriately addressed.\n\nThe Student Experience Team has created a series of traditions that brings the student body together as well, to fight the isolation that can commonly occur when students transition into college. Every monday evening a different student takes a leap of faith and give their \u201cMinerva Talk\u201d, by sharing the story of their life so far. On Wednesdays students gather in small groups for Supper Clubs where they all bring some food to share as they explore questions that push them to be vulnerable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile we still working on figuring out a lot of how we address student well being (and build this university) it\u2019s become clear that the future of student care must be holistic and not just reactive.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts and also what you are working on!

During this period, a consultant suggested me to collaborate with a team who was working on one of the first projects funded by EU in Italy...the team was searching for one candidate with my profile, but even didn't know where to look for.\n\nI obviously accepted, but: what about my english? No problem - I said to myself - that's simply a new opportunity. And it really was, as I HAD TO relate with many people around Europe (<u><em>please note</em></u>: I really thing that for italian people the languages unknowledge is still a big gap!). And it was so satisfying to me that the decision - at the end of the project - to engage for a new opportunity around Europe. I searched for institutions operating in my field (<u><em>please note</em></u>: it was 1999 and Internet in Italy was not so popular as now) and I selected three, respectively based in London, Paris and Munich.\n\nWell Luisa, I said to myself, once again a new challange: who would have answered first ? (translation: you maybe need to study french and german too. I did).\n\nAfter a couple of months I working as researcher (half in english, half in germn of course ;) by the militar university in Munich, experiencing in many projects even co-funded by the EU. A great experience.\n\nAfter a few time I decided to go back to Italy, as I was contacted by many people as they could not find someone with my profile (<em><u>please note:</u></em> once again, the question was to find someone with knowledges in Gis, english and able to travel)\n\nThen I starded working for projects concerning the e-government scenario and few years lately I applied for a public selection by a local administration searching for someone with my profile (<em><u>please note:</u></em> I was the only one candidate..)\n\nAt the moment I am still working there, but I am still studying too for a specialization.\n\nAs Alberto, mine is an unusual-profile.\u00a0\n\nActing in the perspective to recognize it makes my mind open to unformal recruitment processes, but with the confidence that what I'm going to do next will encrease the base I move with by approaching any new job.\n\n\u00a0\n\nps.

From there came the idea of representative democracy, as well as the research on voting theory. After all modern states were too big to all fit in a room, communication too slow to let everybody participate, so it was unavoidable that few people needed to decide for the others. And if this was the case, voting theory tried to solve the problem of finding the most fair way to chose <em>among a set of given alternatives</em> the best solution, based on the preferences of a number of participants. Although this might sound very democratic it has a big drawback. Who chooses what are the possible alternatives?\n\nThis is not just a theorethical sterile question. Especially if you consider that a common criticism given toward modern democracy is that our choises when we vote are among parties that are more and more similar to each other. A new form of decision making is necessary. Something that let people not just chose among a series of alternatives, but also insert new solution themselves. And build up, upon existing solutions, to create something truly innovative.\n\nIn other terms <strong>we need to move from fair decision making among given alternatives, to fair decision making over an open question</strong>.\u00a0\n\nThis is not a simple transition, as the tools are all but built, and the theory behind it hasn't yet been studied. I have tried to frame the question in a <a href=\"http://home.pietrosperoni.it/index.php/research/epart/2011comsoc/\">previous talk</a>.\n\nBut the research we developed was not just trying to frame the question, but also trying to answer it. For this we developed two different tools. Both work with open questions, and both are being hosted at <a href=\"http://vilfredo.org\">Vilfredo.org</a>. The name, Vilfredo, being a recognition to Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian Economist who developed the Pareto Front. A mathematical tool used extensively on Vilfredo.org.\n\nThe two tools developed are somehow complementary, and although they don't cover the whole range of the necessities, they do cover quite a bit. Both work on open questions.\u00a0The first tool is Vilfredo Genetic Algorithm. It is a Human Based Genetic Algorithm where users go through a series of round, In each round they alternatively read a selection of the proposals of previous generation, present new proposals, and vote on the proposals made from others. The system then use the votes of the participants to chose the new selection of proposals in a way to be both exclusive (trying to eliminate as many proposals as possible), and inclusive (making sure each participant point of view is represented in the selection). The result is a series of further approximation where different ideas are investigated in parallel, integrated, voted, and finally when (or if) a comprehensive proposal is presented approved by all. But experience showed that this process worked well with some questions and not others, and if the group of people participating are of a certain size (and not too big or too small).\n\nThe second tool is usually referred to Vilfredo Bubbles. In this tool users are invited to present and vote proposals that are then presented as bubbles in a sort of tank. Bubbles enter from the left and move to the right. Bubbles above are considered better than bubbles below. And bubbles start always from the top row. But each new bubble that arrives makes it harder for the old bubbles not to drop. Eventually the highest row will always contain the best and newest proposals. Most similar system tend to show either the newest or the most votes proposals. With the unavoidable result that eventually proposals in the \"most voted\" list will have gathered so many votes to make it impossible for new proposals to ever enter into that list. Practically closing the system to new proposals.\n\nAs mentioned before the two system seem to work on mutually exclusive systems. Vilfredo bubble seem to work well for \"what\" questions. Situations where an open questions is fully open to receive many unrelated proposals. And more than one can in parallel be implemented. \"What shall we do about the economy/immigration/education\". All those are what questions. And all are open to different answer, which often can be implemented in parallel. Instead Vilfredo Genetic Algorithm tends to be more useful for \"how\" questions. \"How shall we build this website?\", \"how shall we organise the edgeryders conference?\". While \"what\" questions are open to multiple indipendent answers, the \"how\" questions usually are best answered by a single answer. Multiple answers need to have their differences smoothed out to reach an integration that is valid for all the participants.\n\nAlso while Vilfredo Genetic Algorithm tend to work best for small group of people (the limit being that each participant MUST reas every proposal, and the filter process become inefficient when too many point of view are considered). Vilfredo Bubbles can be used by any number of people.\u00a0\n\nAs we explained before those are tools. But then the importance is how can those be used in e-Government, and e-Democracy. Vilfredo bubbles was integrated as a Facebook application, and was then used to let people decide how to gather the sorted garbage in Trastevere. An authentically impossible task for one of the most turistic district in Rome. A place with small streets, many turists (that thus will have to figure out the rules), restaurants that remain open until late, and a living community that seem to always be getting more annoyed with the situation.\n\nYou can see the proposals presented <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/AMATrastevere/app_162694727825\">here</a>.

Many of those here in the community I know, and have already had the pleasure to work with over the last years, but there is something intriguing about the ever new connections we\u2019re making with one another.\n\n<span>Just 3 years ago I was graduating from university in my home town in Romania, stacked with diplomas and onboarding an unpaid traineeship, exploring everything and anywhere in the social science field \u2013 especially academic. I was <a href=\"/t/agora/286/standing-still-at-crossroads\">lost</a>, just as many young graduates are</span>. <span>No need to go there because it turns out whichever way you look at it: as a great student with great perspectives, a smashing volunteering record, supporting middle class family willing to go into debt just so you travel the world in search of opportunities, it\u2019s still not clear what makes the difference and lands a young adult somewhere awesome. It\u2019s all about the journey and trying your best.. and that\u2019s what most of us are doing, no?</span>\n\nBeing part of this community of people from across the world, navigating life with responsibility and generosity, led to <strong>opportunities for me to discover work I didn\u2019t know it existed</strong>. I\u2019<span>m doing community building: connecting people with one another on the Internet and making a strong point that collaboration with peers actually works and can get you to do what you want, live out of your passion no matter how much money you\u2019ve got in your pocket. </span>As long as you\u2019re committed and can keep afloat until breakthough.<span> Myself, I made a huge time investment in what is Edgeryders, both the community and the social enterprise. I am very hopeful when I see my friends making contributions in their environments in all parts of the <a href=\"/t/agora/286/catching-up-on-the-latest-edgeryders-are-up-to-globally\">globe</a> and know that us talking to one another here and helping each other plays a part in it. \u00a0\u00a0</span>\n\nThe best I\u2019ve been wished so far from a friend at home is <span>\u201cHappy social hacking over the year!\u201d This came on a half serious, half joking tone, as the friend in question is in the big business league (commercial) and as most of those surrounding me, gets and doesn\u2019t really get what hacking the world is about. I myself am learning about it every day as we\u2019re living the burden of world challenges on our own skin and trying to make a difference - whether it\u2019s to buy healthy food straight from a farmer rather than the supermarket, to take a free online course instead of paying for education, or join your peers as they\u2019re taking the streets for a cause, instead of saying that nobody listens and nothing will change anyway. With Edgeryders making a difference goes beyond being part of great initiatives or straying along, because together we're actually creating and enabling these opportunities for many more around us!

Will our guests have ideas for sessions? Will they be prone to simply initiate a discussion, or give a workshop, based on their rich experience? We tried and we are happy with the result and the learning opportunity we were given.\n\nTo start with, what worked well?\n\nI think the most important element was the combination of tech-oriented Raspberry Pi workshop given by Ajay from RAN (Robotics Association of Nepal) who introduced a group of people to what this little strange thing we brought with us is capable of, with more socially-concerned meetings and discussion that catered the needs of artists and activists who came over. This way we both had a hands-on thing going on in the Pie Room downstairs, and a parallel, dense discussion and introduction to important issues our participants are dealing with.\n\nAs a result, we had four sessions going on throughout the day\n\n1. Raspberry Pi Workshop\n\n2. Sustainable Buildings\n\n3. Let's talk about (not) undermining resilience\n\n4. Citizen Journalism\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4389ede68f1893440b09341e12ed8fb770de5db6.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Sustainable Buildings</h3>\n\nThis first session, taking place in the Chillout Room (one of the things we have learnt is that we need only chillout rooms for sessions, with a lot of light, internet, snacks and drinks at handy, and comfortable sofas), was sparked by a short discussion I had with the arriving participants. Understanding what are the things they work on after the earthquake, but also in general, showed a wide-spread concern about the reconstruction phase happening now in Nepal. Half of about thirty participants decided to stay and discuss it.\n\nWe started with some elements of resilience. Participant who works for<a href=\"http://projectek.info/\"> Project EK</a> on building temporary learning units that substitute demolished schools shared with us a couple of interesting ideas and observations. First of all, we were told how collaboration with the government goes in his case - as designing and building these units cannot be done without their knowledge, they took the designs available on the governmental websites and decided to improve them, sending the ideas back and asking for approval. Once that is accepted, they can go on with construction.\n\nWhat everyone agreed on, the only way things could have been done efficiently in the last weeks in Nepal, was by individual and collective determination and organisation. Only improvised, grassroot response that remains until now widely unrecognised by officials and NGOs/INGOs, or entities such as Red Cross or UN, was efficient enough to actually reach devastated and disconnected places, discover which areas are in need, assess the needs and provide actual help. Even though this process obviously had its flaws and disadvantages, it spared precious time. We've seen it - the emergent, low-level model of coordination did miracles hacking the system and avoiding ridiculous limitations. And most of the flaws of the response, such as duplication or sending unnecessary supplies, were not harmful.\n\nSecond point: great misrepresentation of the efforts happening in the remote areas at the moment: stop covering the heroic efforts of Kathmandu's youth and so called disaster celebrities. Indeed, there is yet another area to explore. A vast territory of so called local contacts (along with all the questions, such as who were they, how were they identified, what was their role and motivation, what is their opinion about the relief work done? etc), things that have been happening in many places without any help from any side, houses that are being reconstructed at this very moment, and incredible know-how accumulated by the villagers who were able to solve any given problem. One great example of the far-sighted thinking in the villages is the fact that some of the people spent extra time on building longer shelters as they figured out that once they move out, they would serve great as mushroom greenhouses.\n\nWhat's left then for the people in the city? Looks like the best use of technology and skills that are unavailable in the villages will be to keep institutions accountable and spend time on discovering how the money is spent. One of the participants already started: he is now writing letters to different donors who pledged and raised millions of dollars which never arrived to Nepal, asking what exactly happened to these sums? There is probably no chance that an individual will be answered that question, but if this turns into massive spamming and a big campaign, it might eventually lead to a disclosure.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4effe9eb3ad7a9f7a511d1173823f48380cad127.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"411\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">(not) undermining the resilience</h3>\n\nThe transition to the next session happened organically, as speakers gradually shifted from the city to the village and started praising the response to the disaster they saw in the villages. It started with a little political anecdote from a village where one of the young inhabitants said: <em>there will be three disasters in Nepal. One - earthquake. Second - monsoon. Third: all the politicians will have their legs cut off.</em> Villages are incredibly resilient, which definitely has something to do with the fact that they are forgotten and neglected by their democratically elected representatives. In best case villagers are utilised in political campaigns, which they are well aware of. Left alone in quite difficult conditions, with horrible roads and hospitals hours of drive away, they were forced to be self-sufficient and independent. And this is what external perspective notoriously oversees, quoting ideas from university graduates about what is the organic, what is the sustainable, what is the self-contained. It takes just a bit of humility and a couple of hours in one of these detached, underdeveloped areas to understand where real resilience is happening all the time, without anyone's help.\n\nThere is some space left for help here and it is mostly based on technological advantages of educated people who could contribute to creating more effective economies in these remote places and help people use and promote what is at their disposal already. This way a vicious circle of debts and migrations to countries where people earn little and live in bad conditions could be broken - by changing the perspective, both of the people, and of the villages, in terms of their potential development and self-sufficiency.\n\nNevertheless, as one of the participants stressed, the biggest threat comes from the high-level help - their incompetence, inefficiency and the fact that their actions cripple people and make them dependent. The questions are: how to empower and remind these people what they do is of the highest value? And how to stop big agencies from what they do - raising huge amounts of money and misusing them, showing pictures of spectacular successes in places where they just build nice tents, and so on.\n\nI liked the way things were concluded by our participants this day: you ask how to do something? Don't ask, go and do it.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dec78376e436a10c6623d3af3bf377a9d844ad7f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Citizen Journalism Session</h3>\n\nThe last session this day led to both inspiring discussion but also an idea for our future workshop. Our engagement managers, <a href=\"/u/anubhutipoudyal\">@anubhutipoudyal</a> and <a href=\"/u/dipti_sherchan\">@Dipti_Sherchan</a>, presented the method we have together developed to make Future Makers Nepal happen. Showing to our participants the questions they used when interviewing inspiring people, and the motivations they have while deciding on whom to talk with, they stressed important factors of personal interest in the topics covered and reward in form of a finished piece that gets published and shows a portion of reality you really wanted to talk about to the others.\n\nThe example of a student of journalism, Rai Bahing, who keeps a daily journal and writes inspiring, unique stories on her facebook profile, and whose work went viral and became an empowering source for people affected by the disasters, shows the potential and importance of civil journalism.\n\nAnother important aspect of citizen journalism is a lower entry barrier - it is accessible to regular people who want to share their story, try their skills, do not have time to submit a proper journalistic work, etc.\n\nHaving this more egalitarian model of depicting reality (even if it doesn't have the credibility and importance of recognised media outlets, however dubious they tend to be) where opinions are not imposed, but expressed by engaged individuals, can be a great starting point to thoughtful and inclusive reflection, watchdog activities, bringing out more inspiring and positive stories, significantly contributing to creation of a more aware and active civil society.\n\nAfter 8 hours of event we concluded it with a great idea of continuing the meetup with yet another workshop, this time focused on the topic of civil journalism, which will happen in Kathmandu on the 20th of June. We are looking forward to meeting you there again;)\n\nWe are also looking forward to your suggestions, opinions, and written pieces of course;) And hope to see you again very soon!\n\nPs.

I wanted to share our thoughts with all of those interested in strengthening the local productions and helping out small-scale producers by giving them the opportunity to sell their processed products aborad without intermediaries.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>How things are right now (please correct if something is wrong!):\u00a0</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Epelia has built a pool of buyers which use the platform to pursue online specific products (how many of them?)</li>\n\n<li>the buyers compose their orders themselves by choosing their products within an offer made by\u00a0150 local producers</li>\n\n<li>it's not about fresh food, it's about processed food (oil, cheese, ham, <em>sottoli</em>, ecc.)</li>\n\n<li>you want to go International: Matera is the first test for enlarging the network of small-scale producers</li>\n\n<li>local weekly markets in Matera will act as logistic hubs</li>\n\n<li>combined shipment is the way to reduce shipment costs</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHowever...\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>there are 2 markets in Matera: the one in Piazza Ascanio Persio and the one in Piccianello (check <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/243986061\">(</a><a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/243986061#map=17/40.66609/16.60575\">1</a><a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/243986061\">)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2514041775\">(2)</a> out on Open Street Map)</li>\n\n<li>they sell mainly fresh food</li>\n\n<li>they are daily</li>\n\n<li>there is no organized distribution: in Piazza Ascanio Persio the sellers rent the huts out by paying a fee to the Municipality, and bring their products themselves by car every morning.

We are kicking-off with 3-4 established baskets and if it works we are going to go grow the offer and you will actually be able to compose the baskets yourself. But for the moment, we need stability and support, so if you want to go for the baskets, you have to subscribe to a certain amount of shipments\"</li>\n\n<li>since we are speaking of processed food which can be consumed in time, I guess that 1/month can be enough?</li>\n\n<li>they won't actually buy the stuff which is sold at the markets in Matera but we can keep the narrative to make it appealing (\"your basket straight from the Matera market with no intermediaries\")</li>\n\n<li>once we have a certain number of orders we can go for the first shipment (Lois is collecting the information on pallet prices)</li>\n\n<li>I would also encourage a \"buyer-bring-buyer\" approach, so if a buyer introduces a new person to Epelia he gets a little suprise parcel for free in the basket</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat do you think?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-24 08:09:24", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 14:57:32.585977", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 856, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20778, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2396, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Thanks, Bembo!</b>\n\nWhat happened next?

'Barsami', that is how these mothers respond to the question: how many children do you have? Then they start to count on their fingers that are not clearly enough, starting it over and over, fondling the great-grandchildren, their descendants and future generation. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Zegardani is a small village in Khulo Municipality and belongs to the Skhalta community in the Adjara region, where only 16 families</span>. <span>Until now, in all of the sixteen families children-rich mother bustles around, and most of them have a three or more children. These women (and not only) were awarded with the title of 'heroine' back in the USSR, for bearing and raising 10 or more children. Time passed and out of 12 mother 'heroines' only 9 lives on. The youngest, Sonia Makharadze, is 68 years old. She has 13 children and 25 grand-children. As the youngest granny of the Zegardeni, she is looking forward to her great-grandchildren. The eldest mother 'heroine', Emine Shainidze, is 87 years old. She has 11 children, 40 grandchildren, and 61 great-grandchildren. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Guliko Makharadze, 73 years old, is also a child-rich woman. She has raised 14 children and 27 grandchildren in the village. She still feels good and helps her daughter-in-law to raise 5 great-grandchildren.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>People in Zegarden mostly follow agriculture. They cultivate corn and beans, but not in average numbers or quality. \u201c<em>Before, we had a productive harvesting, that was our living\u2026 it is nearly eight years we do not harvest enough and what we yield is not in a good condition: in two months of harvesting corps worsen, beans too</em>\u201d</span>, - regrettably, says <span>mother 'heroine' of 11 children, Venera Shainidze. Her firstborn is 47 years old and youngest 27. She has 28 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. <span>Nowadays, 13 people lives in her family</span></span><span> and their only financial income is Venera\u2019s and her husband\u2019s pension: 300 GEL.</span> Mother Venera has a lot to think about, but her youngest concerns her the most: \u201c<em><span>I have two daughter-in-laws at home, we live three couples together (me and my husband, two sons with their wives), and </span><span><span>third son needs to be settled down as well, but how can I bring third daughter-in-law here with other two?</span> We don\u2019t have any space left at home and no other possibility to live separately. <span>He is already 27 years old and needs his family, and wants his own nest\u2026</span></span></em>\u201d </span>\n\n<span>The village has a lot of problems: <span>school (Zegardani only has a primary school, after the 4th grade, children go to the school in neighboring village)</span>, <span>limited lands,</span> <span>landslides,</span> <span>unemployment</span>, <span>lack of medical care</span> <span>and transportation issues</span>.<span> There doesn't exist any places for sporting either.</span> I<span>n Zegardani, people start talking about problems with the lack of transport: \u201c<em>If we need to go to the region or in a town, we need to walk 5 km, to the village Tsabliani. When we return from there, we might give some extra money to the driver and he brings us to the place. Here we had a mini-bus for the school children, picking them in the morning to school and after the lessons driving back home. Now what happened we don\u2019t know, the mini-bus does not drive anymore! When we ask driver why, he says he was told from Tbilisi not to work anymore, as they could not finance him any longer. Who told him, he doesn\u2019t say. Five km is a long way for a schoolchild. And we are afraid of spine curvature disorders children might develop by taking that heavy bag with them in such a long way.\u201d</em></span></span>\n\n<span>Zegardani knows lasting and snowy winters. Locals say they do not need stairs to get into their houses, as the snow hits the balconies. Youngsters, tired with boredom, cannot visit their neighbors in this weather. Whiles the only fun they can have in this mountainous village is to come together and play joker, backgammon, dominos. In the winter, they ski and compete in table tennis in the school of another village. </span>\n\n<span><span>Guliko sticks to wood (wood is the only thing that is not a problem in the village) stove in winter and names the main problem to be absence of a hospital: \u201c<em>last year I almost lost my daughter-in-law, neighbors saved her. They placed the pregnant woman on a stretcher</em></span><span><em> and took her to Skhalta with their hands. We have ambulance in Skhalta, but they are not even equipped with drugs like Analgin or Dimedrol. Long before, there was a great hospital we had and our health was in a good condition too. This gorge urgently needs a hospital!</em>\u201d</span></span>\n\n<span>The spring is extremely beautiful in village Zegardani. Plums start to blossom and thereby, you can see stunning sparkle of the snow on the sun\u2019s rays. <span>The land is creeping and when spring, snow melts and landslip process emerges. People of Zegardani, till now, remember April 19, 1987, when the landsliade in the village Tsabliani killed dozens of locals. Recalling this unpleasant past, Zegardanies come to tears and regrettably repeat the promise government gave them that time: \u201c<em>everyone received the document, that we are living in a landslide danger zone. Promise was given to build cheap houses and resettle us in lowlands, but nobody remembers that. Every spring we meet with a fear, but we have nowhere to go\u2026</em>\u201d</span></span>\n\n<span>Regardless the harsh conditions, elder people of Zegardani are not willing to leave the place. \u201c<em>We were born and grown here, spilled our sweat in this land and we cannot go anywhere, we will be buried here!</em>\u201d <span>They ask for more attention from the local government: \u201c<em>before, they at least remembered us for mother\u2019s day, inviting us in the center, giving us present. This government has forgotten about us, our gold medals lost their price!</em>\u201d</span></span>\n\n<span>In the village Zegardani people believe, that locals are most vulnerable, but officially only six families are granted with the social status. <span>As young people have no opportunities for employment, they go to Turkey tea picking for the season. Badri Shainidze, 45, takes care of his family in the same way: \u201c<em>Turkey is our bread-winner. We collect tea there for the whole summer, to save our families. The most I have earned on a season is 3000 GEL, but it is impossible to use it for the whole year. We need a stable work!</em>\u201d</span> </span>\n\n<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>\n\n<span>Spring nearly approaches in Zegardani. Locals already start preparing for the spring works. And then mother 'heroines' head to the fields with their grandchildren, young boys continue to collect tea in Turkey, and their sons and daughters will take care of the village\u2026</span>\n\n\n<img

tired of hearing what good drones <em>could </em>do but never seem to get around to <em>actually </em>doing. For example Nepal is not terribly far away from Pakistan where we know there is lots of drones loitering around. Many of them could have hopped over to Nepal with at max one stop-over for refueling in no time flat. I may have missed some (thanks for the link @alberto ), but so far I haven't seen many of the unambiguously beneficial uses exploited a whole lot. And some of them have been blindingly obvious in the last couple of weeks, and really not difficult to get at least <em>working </em>on.\n\nI don't want to belittle the fact that there are many small initiatives all over the place, and in most cases there is a LOT more work going on inside than meets the eye. One of the problems I have though is that if large sums of government money are to be spent on such a technology - that obviously has a significant and very complex societal impact - we don't seem to bother to discuss it in an effective manner. Such an attempt would include the people that make the tech, the people that operate it, and - very important - the ones affected by it. Before we produce all the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mpzk7OdbjBw?t=69\">facts</a>. With drones we are looking at a very wide range of outcomes we could end up with, some of them very difficult or impossible reverse. Also we should be aware of a problem's roots, even when we feel compelled to fight the symptoms. We need to keep track of the externalities of a technology, and stay realistic.\n\nAt the moment all money pretty much goes exclusively to the usual suspects. How can civil society, at least parts of the \"global south\", or women's voices be heard and considered in such a process? When would this be done if not in the early stages of making the concepts? Are the current practices established in industry conducive to such a process (<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/18/us-eu-drones-idUSKBN0O312A20150518\">large mil ind complex organizations elbowing for money</a>)? How is their track record of managing such <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHIndustries_NH90#Origins\">programs</a>, that need to stay flexible and permeable to tackle a field full of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns\">unknown unknowns (and un-unknow some knowns in the process)</a> - to say it with the words of Rumsfeld and \u017di\u017eek, respectively.\n\nOf course it won't be simple and it won't be without friction, but if I weigh this against the societal cost of opportunity, and ER's chance to help connect and guide many center actors through a very dynamic edge - the problem has our name written all over it. I would love to hear other people's perception on this before I publish the next steps I could envision this taking.

How this team responded to the disaster that ensued 25th April, 2015 is remarkable. I met up with Sunoj Shrestha, who was heading the team Nawa Marg - their earthquake response initiative.\u00a0</em>\n\n<strong>We are teachers!</strong>\n\n\"On the day of the earthquake, we were having a children\u2019s play at Karkhana. When things started to shake, we came out of the room and went to the open space. We did not believe that the Dharahara had fallen although news had already started to come in. So, Sakar and I decided to go around places in our cycles to see what had happened. But we were not allowed to enter any of these places. We saw buildings had fallen but it wasn\u2019t as bad as we had thought. We took some photos, and came back. We thought that it was crucial for the information to go out so we started posting the photos and details on internet. Then we got a lot of requests from our friends abroad asking us to get in touch with their families here.\n\nInitially, we were involved in relief collection and dispatching for 3-4 days. I went to Kavre, Dhading, Budanikantha, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur. The condition was very depressing and there were a lot of needs. We did a lot of relief work than rescue work. What I realized during that was, our time was not being utilized properly by just collecting and dispatching relief materials. But we did not know what to do \u2013 we did not have any first aid training or rescue training, neither did we have proper knowledge on sanitation. We are teachers.\"\n\n<strong>Knocking at the door of opportunity</strong>\n\n\"Since everyone was catering to physical needs, we started to focus on psychological needs. We thought the earthquake has affected the children. When the schools start to reopen, things won\u2019t be normal. So, how can we bridge that? Our team decided to work on it and prepared a quick lesson plan for children with improve plays to take at various camps. I was one of the first ones to go out there along with an intern from Karkhana to camps that had settled nearby Kumari Hall. We saw a bus full of children so I explained what we were trying to do to the parents. The parents agreed and we collected around 15 children and started playing.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/992437512c73aaaf41a3e8ac8dd8353b2e2df2d7.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\"After an hour, I went to Uttar Dhoka. Our team member, Sachet had already gone there to assess the situation since there was an army camp there. He informed me that they do not allow such activity but I asked him to request again since there were so many children in the camp. Finally, they agreed because the children were starting to give them all sorts of trouble so they could not handle them. Then we started contacting psychologists. One of the psychologists, Rachana Pandey, promptly responded to our request. We went to meet her, and she told us that she will send us an outline that will help us learn how to deal with children during disaster situation like an earthquake. The most important thing about this process was to make the children feel safe.\u00a0\"\n\n<strong>Identifying resources and collaborating efforts</strong>\n\n\"We could not manage to do this everywhere. At the end of the day, teachers are the ones who deal with the children so we decided to work with training teachers because it would have a much bigger impact. We designed a teacher\u2019s training program and we ran it for 2 sessions. It was effective but the problem was we did not know how to do it properly. So we started to look for organizations that are capable at doing this. We identified Rato Bangala Foundation (RBF) which has been doing such kind of work for a long time.\n\nWhen we started to post about our activity, teachers from Kasthamandap and Nisarga schools who were proactive had already started to work with us as volunteers. If anyone asked, they would just say that they were our volunteers.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/708d2f2049990b143652fbec0ff704c79345dfad.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"456\"><br>\n\n\"The focus that we had on psycho-social counseling to engage the children to get back to their normal state helped us streamline the plan. But the lesson plan was in English so we had it translated. We also needed a training for the teachers who would deliver the plan so we prepared a one day long training of teachers (of 7 hours). And to train those teachers, we had to prepare another two days long training workshop called Training of Trainers (ToT). All of this, we managed to do in a week. Then, we started to hold massive ToT at different places. At first we did it at Rato Bangala for 90 teachers from Kasthamandap, Nisarga, RBF and Rato Bangala School (RBS). We had a condition that whoever took this two days training had to conduct at least one workshop for teachers. We had a pool of 45 pairs who could hold 45 sessions. And if we had 30 teachers in one session, we would be able to reach 1000 teachers in a day. So, in a week, we planned to train 3000 teachers which would help us reach 60,000 children. That was our big estimate.\"\n\n<strong>Bigger steps and confronting challenges</strong>\n\nThen we started to contact Private and Boarding Schools' Organization (PABSON), and National Private and Boarding School's Association (N-PABSON)\u00a0and government officials explaining to them our 7 hours long, one-day training program. We requested them to provide us the venue and we would provide lunch, stationery, and trainers. Bhaktapur was the most proactive in responding and we were able to have 12 sessions in two days.\u00a0All in all, we were able to hold 80 sessions in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Kavre. We trained 3,000. Kathmandu and Lalitpur PABSON were not active and they had their own agendas. They do not care about their students.\n\nAfter setting all of this up, we transferred all the work to the volunteers so the rest of us would have time to look at the bigger picture. It was not enough that we did it in Kathmandu, we knew that it was important to take this outside Kathmandu but at that time, it was not possible for us to just go to Sindhuplachowk (or other places) so it wasn\u2019t realistic. So the most realistic place for us was Dhading, since I am also from there, it was nearby, and it was also affected.\"\n\n<strong>Massive scale and coverage of an entire affected district</strong>\n\n\"We decided to cover the entire area of Dhading. There are around 3000-3500 in the district teachers; we decided to focus on one area instead of going to different places since we did not have enough time, and budget. We prepared a plan and a budget; and there were positive responses from few places. As soon as we received these responses, we did not worry about the money because we knew money would not be a problem. So Sakar and I went to Dhading on Wednesday. We had already coordinated with RBF, so we had already coordinated with the District Education Officer (DEO). The DEO who was very excited and happy. This was because smaller organizations would come and want to work with one or two schools but we went there with a big plan to cover the entire district. So, he agreed and contacted all the resource persons (RP) and school supervisors.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3756c4b9bb6c2267d4348ff90c569838b717f57b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n\"The training was facilitated by Dipesh and\u00a0 Suman Mandal (from RBF). Initially, they were not convinced with the content of the training because it was very new for them. Their training involved pen and pencil, listening, eating breakfast and receiving \u201cbhatta\u201d (allowances) but ours was completely engaging which required them to participate completely. But at the end, they were totally convinced and realized this is what they needed. Then, it became very easy. After that, they coordinated in 20 resource centers and passed on the information.\n\nHowever, we encountered a problem where the RPs would want to lengthen the process while we wanted to work efficiently. There was a bit contradiction so, we asked them to list down all the centres and we mapped everything,\u00a0assessed which area would need how many sessions. The locals also helped us to this assessment. We got the number of sessions down to 118 from 130 and we kept more sessions on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday because we could bring trainers from schools from Kathmandu.\"\n\n<strong>Satyadevi: Risk paid off!</strong>\n\n\"I also went to Satyadevi village myself. I had been coordinating so far and I would hear people bring information of landslide and all. So I decided to go since I had also not conducted any training in Dhading. Me, Sneha, and local RP went early in the morning at 8 am (although the plan was to leave at 6 am). Transportation was a big problem because initially they sent us new vehicle but later on started to send old ones. The one that I had gone in had a flat tire! After a while, its clutch also got damaged. The driver managed to fix the vehicle and we reached the place at around 1:30 pm. We started the training at 2 pm. The problem there was that people had come from remote places to attend the sessions \u2013 so we only had 2 hours to cover the content of 7 hours. Amazingly, we managed to cover 90% of the content in 2 hours because we worked under a tight schedule.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/835593f1dcf2a21b3652c2c11c8aad85bf16bc78.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n\"There were a lot of experiences, we slept in mats, had to ride bikes through broken suspension bridges; but we realized that the kind of risk we had taken then was big. If it had rained just one day, it would have been a big disaster. \u00a0We had no first aid kit, tent, or food in our backpack. It was all \u201crough and tough\u201d. Anyway, after a week, everyone was happy, teachers were excited because they felt comfortable that they could do this in their class. There was a change \u2013 everyone seemed confident. \"\n\n<strong>Stark realities</strong>\n\nThe DEO of Dhading was a person with a stand. Dhading was being taken care of by World Vision but when we reached there, they had only managed to do one meeting there. They had not done much there. We were the ones who were able to do something of that massive nature. I think the government also hasn\u2019t done anything of that massive scale.\n\nWe do not know if we want to work in other districts. It is already late in other places. We received a lot of feedback on how our initiative was a bit late since they had already dealt with the students. If it had managed to be there even a week before, it would have been more effective. Another thing is, what is the need of the community? In Dhading, there were places where nothing had reached so conducting a teacher\u2019s training makes no sense. They need other basic resources perhaps. What is the need of the moment \u2013 psychosocial counseling or building shelters?\"\n\n<strong>Aiming larger, higher, and better</strong>\n\n\"We have other phase of plan for Dhading since we have become familiar with the district. The next phase is to conduct teacher training module for English and Math for at least two teachers in each school. In that training, we will adjust the activities that we used during the earthquake module to teach subjects like English, Math and Science. We are focusing English and Math because these are the subjects a lot struggle with.\u00a0\n\nOur long term goal is to work with a school that is completely destroyed to design their classrooms after assessing the need of the community, teaching pedagogy, and all that. But that is in our third or fourth phase. In addition to that, we want to make a makers space that would run along with the school. It will have wood working, and other tools. The community people can borrow the tools to reconstruct the village but the students can also learn. We are actually doing this as a pilot at Dhading. We have given them some power tools. We are trying to set a makers space there.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1a62742612396905ab1180a58ca1deb80a1497f3.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\u00a0\n\nBut first, Nawa Marg needs to be consolidated for earthquake preparedness itself. There is a big chance of flooding, so we are planning to work. But, we haven\u2019t made any decision on what we want to do immediately. Things have yet to settle down. We are now working on documentation and feedback.\"\n\n<strong>Measuring the pulse of the nation</strong>\n\n\"After the earthquake, seeing the youth self-mobilize is very encouraging. This is also a part of the story. To tie up education and counseling, we knew this would be a need very initially. We just tapped into that opportunity that turned out to be of such massive scale. And we managed to do this in Nepal. What made it possible\u2026 \u201cI have to do something\u201d attitude in the general public, especially from the teachers\u2019 side who realized that things have to be done differently. We were able to tap into that feeling. We gave them something that was prepared beforehand which could be used by them. This gave them the confidence \u2013 everyone from the DEO to the RPs. Whoever took the ToT, they want to contribute. They want to go out and do something. This gave them some sense of achievement, whoever took the ToT gave training. Although we had a limited pool of trainers, everyone was excited, engaged, and ready to go the ground. Everyone wanted to help us with this initiative because this was demand-driven. Everyone had felt it, we just aided to visualize this. The self-realization and motivation helped. We just guided in showing the path.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b84d16f086e80f295303778382c250a9de5f707.png\" width=\"436\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\"I think of all this talk on resilience like <strong>a pulse</strong> \u2013 like a catchy song that becomes a hit song. I think those who attended the training and saw people walking for hours to attend the training realized that their effort was making an impact. That feeling will help sustain that resilience. Like things like health camp was conducted and then it ended. It depends on person to person. Those kind of people are very few.\"\n\n<em>This is a cut-down version of the conversation that I have put up and sort of categorized into sub-headings but we ended up conversing for almost more than an hour.

Molotov cocktails and street fights were expected and many seem to be disappointed but what actually happened is that the government tried to disperse the crowd by splitting the members of \"No to Plunder\" hoping that people will go home or just stay @ Freedom square thus opening Baghramyan ave.\u00a0\n\nOn June 28 right after the President said he will subsidize the electricity price hike from the budget(i.e. our taxes) faking a solution by a word game, everyone expected police violence after 11PM if the avenue stays occupied. Around 7-8PM at Baghramyan one of the members of \"No to Plunder\" made an announcement that we need to form groups for public discussion and decide on our future actions(to stay or leave, formulating the demands, etc). They have already stated that they will stay with the majority and support us no matter what we decide on. So I walk away from the stage and try to see what groups are discussing. Not even 5 minutes later, I hear some people shouting \"Freedom Square\" and I see a line of people led by the member of \"No to Plunder\" walking all the way out of the avenue and towards the Freedom square taking with them half of the protesters. A panic raised in the crowd as people were deciding what to do next, while around 500+ police officers surrounded the protesters that did stay at the avenue, banging on their shields with batons, trying to scare the crowd and make people leave, and we were basically blocked from both sides with no way out. Yes, this part was really scary, but I knew that if we stay on the sidewalk the police can not touch us + they have no right to attack peaceful protesters, so people just sat on the street and waited.\u00a0\n\nHalf an hour later, almost the whole crowd that left for Freedom Square+ more people came to join the protest at the avenue. This was a thrilling experience indeed. Police was blocking their way from entering and joining the rest but they eventually broke through. I actually hugged an old lady standing next to me out of joy to see my people uniting again.\n\nBut there was still a small crowd @ Freedom square together with the members of \"No to Plunder\" and the media focused all their attention on them purposefully, misinforming people by stating that the protest moved to Freedom square and the few ones left @ Baghramyan ave were drugged, extremist and looking to get beaten by the police. I couldn't believe my ears on the way home listening to the radio in the taxi. Baghramyan was fuller than ever and the media is telling us it's all over and the President solved our issues and this is victory!\n\nOf course, nothing happened by 11PM as the police could not dare to attack such a huge crowd full of women and children. But the members of \"No to Plunder\" were gone(apparently they were blackmailed by the government - <strong><em>you stop this or you and your family will pay for it +reward(position, etc) and in case you tell anyone about this it will be even worse</em></strong> - \u00a0though they do not admit - I talked to one of them yesterday and he just said they are not leading the movement but are around and try to organize public discussions throughout the country).\u00a0\n\nAfter June 28 things got even more hectic. Without a leader and ready made decisions people tried to form groups and discuss the further actions but there were lots of provocateurs inside the crowd that made people's attention shift from the main topic. Also without the \"leaders\" we were deprived from all kind of audio equipment (loudspeakers, etc) which they took with them but we got some now.\n\nFrom June 30 and till today intelligent and competent people gather together and discuss the agenda and further actions and I consider this as a victory as finally we try to self-organize and reach a consensus. Nobody is taking about having a leader and it's all about self-organisation.\n\nI tried to bring around the alternative/renewable energy but no interest so far unfortunately, looking for interested people who could actually help and I will get back to you both @Matthias and @trythis so that we can maybe have a skype call/google hangout and see how we can proceed. I think we will go for crowdfunding as the Armenian diaspora is ready to help so this is the best way to go + each building that will agree to have the solar panels installed(or any other alternative that is cheaper) will contribute as much as they can.\n\nAnd here's <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/opinion/article/dissent-is-building-at-the-barricades-in-yerevan/524735.html\">an article </a>about the recent developments.\u00a0\n\nWill keep you posted.\u00a0\n\nCheers,\n\nAnna\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-02 20:44:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.848692", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1656, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21573, "user_id": 196, "topic_id": 1910, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>IMAGE PROBLEM</b>\n\nIs it me or the image is unreadable because too small?\n\nThanks!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-09 08:58:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.063011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23271, "user_id": 2580, "topic_id": 4487, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Yes!</b>\n\nthis will find a way into tomorrow's dinnertime conversation.

I can't see how that helps in any way. Worse, it seems to point at potential conflict of \"us\" vs. \"them\", rather than at the <a href=\"/t/diversity-trumps-ability-why-senior-civil-servants-political-leaders-and-entrepreneurs-are-teaming-up-with-hackers-squatters-artists-and-activists-in-the-name-of-stewardship/3842\">generative potential of diversity</a>. But maybe I am wrong. Can you explain why it seems so attractive to you?\n\nIn return for your explanation, I can offer an alternative interpretation. It goes like this: at some point someone started an unMonastery prototype. People could choose whether to locate themselves deep inside, stay completely out or anything in between. Examples of in-between behaviour:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>visit</li>\n\n<li>participate in the online debate</li>\n\n<li>buy a resident unMonasterian coffee/ice cream/a meal to cheer her/him up</li>\n\n<li>help with admin/politics/fundraising</li>\n\n<li>write an article/make a film about what is being done</li>\n\n<li>various combinations of the above and more</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nPeople closest to the center have a greater stake; people further away a smaller one. This is not an ontology because it is flexible: people can adjust their position by getting more or less involved. No one is locked into a category. No one is completely dismissed, because even people who are not involved at all\u00a0<em>might</em>\u00a0decide to move towards the center, and they would be welcome to. I know you don't like T-shirts, but there is a reason why the one I am wearing now says \"Networks have no borders\"!\n\nNote that that does\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>mean everyone is the same: different nodes have different degrees of centrality (so this allows for who does the work calls the shots).

The aim of the project is to protect, encourage, and facilitate the <strong>reporting of risk </strong>with regard to members projects, or indeed the EdgeRyders project as a whole. It is a sort of <em>Whistle Blowing Manifesto</em> for EdgeRyders.\n\n<h4>So what's the problem?</h4>\n\nThe problem is that there are hard and <strong>important limits</strong> to <strong>radical transparency,</strong> especially when you add the requirement to discuss all issues on a text based online platform - however good the platform is. This topic is a place to constructively discuss this thesis, and to propose patches or fixes to the problem.\n\nAnother aim of the project is to come up with community techniques to prevent unnecessary flame-wars. Not all flame-wars are unnecessary, but there is a specific category of flame-war which is detrimental to effective knowledge sharing within an open topic - and that is not simply the problem of trolling, and bad online etiquette. The problem I am referring to is a structural problem, regarding deep criticism of an individual or groups work.\n\n<h4>What sort of criticisms are problematic?</h4>\n\nMost criticisms are fine to post directly and transparently on EdgeRyders. Indeed this is to be encouraged. The regular early, and open participation of a wide range of members is vital to the process of tapping into the collective intelligence of the group. However this founding principle of EdgeRyders has it's limits, and it is the purpose of this topic to discuss and elaborate these limits.\n\nOne of the forms of criticism, that appears to be deeply problematic to EdgeRyders current philosophy, is worth elaborating here. It is subtle and a little hard to express, but I believe it is essential to the health of this community. The difficulty arises when: \n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The topic of criticism is a piece of work that an individual or group has invested significant time or energy in.</li>\n\n<li>The criticisms is complex, philosophical, and may take time to listen to and comprehend.</li>\n\n<li>Or the criticism is highly novel</li>\n\n<li>Or expressed in a language or cultural tradition very different from the person being criticised.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn this circumstance, the natural reaction of the people intimately involved in the project, and wider community, is to protect the individual, their reputation, and the work they have invested. This is true even if the critic is proposing a positive alternative. This is because the positive alternative can at the same time be a deep and highly personal criticism of another individuals competence, or it can fundamentally undermine a groups ethos - provoking a backlash. The motivations are all good, but it results in important critical feedback being missed from the planning process, only for these problems to hit the project hard at a later date.\n\n<h4>Why is this topic private?</h4>\n\nThe aim of this topic is for it to evolve into a safe place for critical thinking or whistle blowers. It is a place where I'd like to discuss problems and issues from both the recent past (by way of example), and more importantly of present and future projects. One initial proposal for a methodology that would address this is that the following principles should apply to all discussions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Discussions are private - this is a safe place to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats\">Black-Hat</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Conversations are constructive - if you criticise you must offer a positive alternative.</li>\n\n<li>Conversations should not refer to individuals unless absolutely necessary. However it will almost always be very clear which individuals or groups are being referred to.</li>\n\n<li>Conversations will be made public (in order to keep the content respectful). However exactly when and how these conversations are to be made public is a matter to be planned and discussed in this topic.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h4>A Practical Start</h4>\n\nTo make a start the plan is to slowly invite people, particularly people intimately concerned with these topics, and to discuss through the way of real-world constructive examples how to proceed. If this experiment works out to the satisfaction of the group, the entire proceedings of this project including all proposed methodologies, and the details of individual discussions help here will be published.

You are probably right especially since you made your experiences in the jewelry design business. Actually these facts have been letting me avoid getting into the business too intensely after all. Selling jewelry is rather luck or coincidence even with friends I know who run such businesses on a highly professional level. And also the fact that it is something typically women wear close to their body and by which they present a certain taste, style or status, they usually want to see and touch it in 3D.

However; of what\u00a0use could these benefits be if there is nothing to do? In Germany, refugees are not allowed\u00a0to pick proper work for the first three months of their stay. After that period, a working\u00a0permit is needed to apply for a job. The permit, however, is only granted if the person is no\u00a0longer living in a refugee camp. Needless to say, the said three months often pass without\u00a0anything really happening and three months slowly turn into six months and into a year\u00a0- during which there is nothing to do.\n\n<strong>We are currently working at the Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC) in Berlin</strong>- a former congress center that has recently been turned into a refugee camp. Even with the circumstances being unfavourable, the atmosphere at the ICC is quite the opposite: The interaction between the refugees and the staff and security is remarkably free and friendly.\u00a0Volunteers playing with children; refugees and security joking around and everybody is eating at the same table. There is no hint of the provider/receiver-dilemma that you would witness in other establishments.\u00a0We\u2019ve been warmly welcomed by the people and the relationships have gradually grown more personal since our first visit.\n\nThe place is led by the Malteser; we were shown around the place by one of their very nice volunteers. She then introduced us to a room of eight Syrians, four of which were ready to help us in our project and provided us with insights.\n\nBesides stories over everyday rituals like tea and Syrian home traditions, we were shown the little gimmicks to improve the bare rooms where they are living in at the moment: How they pulled out screws and nails from the walls to make clothing hooks; how you make a wall-mounted phone holder with just duct tape and a piece of wood; where to store the food; they showed us how they hack the beds to create more privacy and how to shield the light falling onto the upper beds with merely pieces of wood and a blanket to a point where one could create an entire ceiling with just white cloth.\n\nWe learnt quickly that the ideas of how to use the space could never occur to someone who has never been in that exact position:\u00a0\n\n<strong>It was evident that they know best about\u00a0the needs and necessities in their very situation and environment.</strong>\n\nWith the creative potential, the only problem lies in the lack of tools and materials.\u00a0To see what would happen if material were available, we made a little experiment where\u00a0we brought basics like duct tape, cable ties, string and durable cardboard and looked\u00a0what they would think of building intuitively. Despite scepticism in the beginning, it was\u00a0beautiful to witness the moment when everyone in the room joined to figure out the best\u00a0construction for a wall-mounted shelf, built with mortise and tenon joints. The fact the\u00a0project was dealt with in such a manner, shows the willingness to engage these kinds of\u00a0challenges with seriousness and a certain claim to quality and that it is not only about\u00a0practicality and pure function, for such a shelf could have been easily assembled withjust tape and cardboard. It was fun for us to join the working process and thinking with\u00a0them about the construction and making, but more importantly, it was fun for them to be\u00a0challenged in making something useful and to make that beautifully. Mohammed, who\u00a0came up with the idea of using joinery, later joked saying he would love to make such\u00a0shelves for the whole camp - and we hoped, it was not merely a joke, but a mentality that we\u00a0could continue to work with. In fact, we left all the spare materials in their rooms and by our next visit they had built another two shelves and a small storage for clothes under one of the beds.\n\n<img height=\"223\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SeS9xq-BK7XIQnTHf0SCITt2EeFoBXWx88uniE9pPcQeigJtPNMWXvskrMVBuwW2J121-lJbSzMQJtnfK0-L0xmynHHZdBaZzB4rCLteArdXzDcySWC_Su6KCDoiGZYIwHrcbA3N\" width=\"263\">\n\n<img height=\"222\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ePUoxX2S3DlJlKiEcU88WsFkZJ1k1KI3KZ3SoxxIdyMlFPkwq6BJvr3VbS8WLXEopxxuPrEbZ_s3aVnq7N_wl1UKD2qRUKwnOnBPiFf5Jlgh1oCNL5oL1tn2VhpUbVOOKTZkrwBg\" width=\"296\">\n\n<em>Work in progress: Building a shelf</em>\n\n<img height=\"361\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/slVlOs-VysXEUvFeyeD0AAgm2t3xVJSOCRzUJQ569o18rGOb8UTn3_UWVGH2faeyS2xuNQUm38As6dv_r3i0TMK8W2Vk-hatL6Ci0PWudQQy7bMdEDs6N_fjGM55oT3pivqzaWw-\" width=\"502\">\u00a0\u00a0<img height=\"377\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2BgFMUhk2do3FM_OCRbXgkvXunxUZPrVW2Zj3x6TDA-Cgp79VH4dyY1xfdgasEa6i6f2pN5_ks04A-o1BAyBzWI36AVNce_wLQtsD0phtx8S0He9p-A51JMhX0ol6S8J854n29w1\" width=\"502\">\n\n<em>Image above: One of the shelves that Mohammed made after we left.</em>\n\n<strong>Mohammed\u2019s mentality is exactly what we we\u2019re looking for. </strong>\n\nThe question is if more people in the camp would share the same enthusiasm. Ideally, a craftsman could be found to take the role of a tutor to guide the others into the basics of building. On our last visit in the camp we learnt that the the camp\u2019s organizers are taking help of one of the refugees who used to be a tailor. He now has his working space (a table with a sewing machine) at the intern clothes depot and helps fixing the garments before they\u2019re given out.\n\nWe feel the answer to our problem lies in establishing and expanding that very concept in other camps as well - to involve people in the daily happenings and motivate them to do what they can do best. We will research the willingness amongst the refugees to join such a program as soon as soon as Ramadan is over.\n\nOur plan to help people improving their living situation by building their own furniture is a first step in that direction. We are working on a solution that doesn\u00b4t require proffessional skills or tools, but motivates people and gives them the feeling of doing something useful for them and the community. To establish this first step we are going to launch a fundraising campaign on StartNext in the next weeks and we are happy about any kind of support! If you have suggestions or similiar/different experiences: please share!\u00a0\u00a0So we can make this happen, as good as possible :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<i>The production of this\u00a0article was supported by\u00a0<a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\">Op3n\u00a0Fellowships</a>\u00a0-\u00a0an ongoing program for community contributors\u00a0during May - November 2016.</i>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-01 20:52:06", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 10:52:27.807231", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1269, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 97.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28814, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3883, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>done</b>\n\nYes.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-11 10:11:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.626076", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28699], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10867, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4393, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>oh, yes!</b>\n\nSorry, logic +link were good, text came out wrong.

Actually there is some improvement, concerning the awareness about the situation in the government and policy makers' circle. I am happy to notice that now more and more agencies talk about the issue of Syrian refugees and the need to accommodate them and help them integate in Armenia. As for me, I gradually disengaged from the formal activities of <a href=\"http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/\">Armenian Redwood Project </a>(ARP) since it moved to a more bureaucratic and administrative sphere\u00a0that I was not very comfortable dealing with, compared to the field work I have been doing for over a year, and currently I am only writing content and helping with field work. ARP has now teamed up with other agencies to work on a project of\u00a0offering housing to the refugees with a lease, so that instead of paying rent they can pay for it monthly and own the apartment after a few years. As you know ARP has been subsidizing the rent of the refugees for the past couple of years.\u00a0\n\nNowadays I'm juggling a few projects, all of them are important causes I care for and I wrote case studies about during the Futuremakers project\u00a0- I'm managing a social enterprize <a href=\"www.set.am\">Sunchild Eco Tours\u00a0</a>\u00a0and the Eco Lodge\u00a0in the only privately owned nature reserve in the Caucasus - <a href=\"http://www.fpwc.org/caucasus-wildlife-refuge/\">the CWR</a>, organizing\u00a0events and <a href=\"http://www.ica.am/residency.php\">the AiR program</a> in <a href=\"/en/future-makers-case-studies-adventures/institute-for-contemporary-arts\">the Institute for Contemporary Arts </a>in Yerevan AND working on my own art project <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anush.babajanyan/posts/10153858970905563:0\"><strong>The Return: Environmental Portraits of the Syrian Refugees in Armenia</strong></a> together with my friend and a talanted\u00a0photographer Anush Babajanyan of <a href=\"/t/4-plus-documentary-photography-center/4548\">4Plus Photography</a>. The final product will be a photo exhibition and storytelling event that aimes to bring awareness to the issues of Syrian refugees in Armenia. \u00a0And we will definitely involve the Syrian restaurants to provide food for our opening ceremony(maybe some collective cooking eventually). People in Armenia got to like and appreciate the taste of Levantene cuisine and Syrian food is popular more than ever in Yerevan!\n\nSo yeah, I'm uberstretched and have almost no me-time considering I'm single-parenting since I moved to Armenia in summer 2015. \u00a0Luckily I have had the chance to be one of the beneficiaries of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stegamind/?fref=ts\">Stega\u00a0</a>'s 6 week yoga course for the changemakers of Armenia (just had my last class on Wednesday) and we hope to fundraise to offer yoga and meditative therapy classes for the refugees in the nearest future.\u00a0\n\nI'm also preparing another art project which is called \"Juggling Dinosaurs\" that is going to tackle the notion of single parenting in Armenia for females, who receive no support whatsoever...a woman, a mother, an activist and a professional trying to juggle it all....\n\nSo there you are, now you know why I was absent from the platform for such a long time...hope to meet you all for LOTE6(is it happening?) next year! Edgeryders(you, @Nadia, @Alberto, @Patrick_Andrews and Co) is always on my mind and I'm trying to follow all the developments on the platform.

The problem is not about needing to work, or needing to \"earn\" the right to live. The problem is \"now that we have these technologies and that there is abundance, what do we do with our free time\". \u00a0It is basically a political dimension. And if many of us currently live in monetary poverty, and if many starve to death, it is not because there is not enough (there is potentially too much) : it is because of the concept of property, its accumulation, its hoarding, and artificial scarcity in the interest of control over others.\u00a0\u00a0Hence possibly one\u00a0can adress the question of accumulation of property (and power) vs. personal property (what we use as utility ?), and our shared commons.\n\nQuestions that go well beyond \"universal income\", and well beyond \"money\": property, our own choice in using our common\u00a0heritage in shaping our realities, well beyond \"earning\" it.\n\nOur potentials to choose to use time to learn together, develop new ideas, explore various points of perspective, develop emergent forms of intelligence, and emancipate ourselves beyond the gates of\u00a0\"arbeit macht frei\".\n\nAlso see: <a href=\"http://www.pdfernhout.net/beyond-a-jobless-recovery-knol.html\">Paul D. Fernhout's <em>\"</em></a><em><a href=\"http://www.pdfernhout.net/beyond-a-jobless-recovery-knol.html\">Beyond a Jobless Recovery\"</a></em>.\n\nNote:\u00a0<span>I\u00a0also suggest as action research to deepen potentials for neo nomadic lifestyles, and new forms of organization which can re-develop an approach to using and developing infrastructure, producing, and re-distributing without depending on long term territoriality.</span>\n\n<span>Existentialism and Situationism may also have some proposals, though I personally do not know the theoretical aspects\u00a0in detail.</span>\n\nFurther personal comment:\u00a0What I suffer a lot from, is not as much financial poverty in itself, but the difficulty to keep social cohesion around shared visions, even if there are hardships. Because most of today's engagements are built around the political economy using interest bearing debt based tokens, engagements tend to be limited to our role as providing (or reducing the costs) towards such artificially scarce and centrally controlled tokens. I personally believe that our generation can use our current isolation and deconstruction of society, to re-create new models of social and environmental regeneration, which can maintain and appreciate the\u00a0uniqueness and diversity of\u00a0elements.

The repeated answer is \"not much\".\n\nI asked somebody in my twitter network who is into DIY biotechnology, with a specific question about insulin and he wrote a blogpost saying it wasn't doable right now, and there were things they could work on in the future - apparently it's not simple at all.\n\nI guess it depends. Some medications are generics (doable by several makers) and are already doable more or less in a distributed way, say a factory per 40 million people or less. (That would be a way to measure distributedness, no?) But some are really concentrated in a few working hands.\n\nPart of the trouble is that medications themselves have long and winding supply chains, which in some circumstances (a bad pandemic) are thought to be susceptible to disruption. Here, we're talking about a handful of countries being affected, with \"maker countries\" probably unaffected, or at least less affected. So the supply would be there, it's just that you can't pay for it because you're suddenly poor. If that's the case, then maybe some important medications should just be paid for with international solidarity money. How much and how that's handled, I don't know.\n\nMedications could hypothetically go into a spreadsheet, with how many are affected, how much they are affected, how much medication is needed (people x doses), etc. After appropriate sorting, the spreadsheet would give us 3 categories: \"impossible\" (impossible to do here, so we either import them, or we die), \"possible\" (we need to change how we do things, and we should start looking into \"how\" as soon as we can), and \"done\" (we already make them locally, so they are not really an issue).\n\nMy guess is most medications go into the \"impossible\", but we'd need to ask real experts (world-wide) about \"possible\" and \"done\".\n\nFor our exercise, we'd just have to consider the three categories, and asume each is dealt with differently.\n\nIf there's money or if medications are paid for, transport is not the real problem, because these things are not heavy. Let's go for (I think) high-ish figures, and say 5% of the population need 100 grams of medication a week, that's ... 50000 x 100 / 1000 ... 5000 kilograms per million people and per week. A couple of medium-sized trucks per million and per week. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_classification\n\nSo, factors are 1) production, 2) payment and 3) transport. (Maybe there are others, like quality control, local distribution, etc, but we can work from those 3 factors.)\n\nJust asking the important questions might take us somewhere - if not now, then later.\n\nJust my 2 cents!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-12 16:21:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.663280", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 507, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3783, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3750, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A meeting point where people who use encrypted communication can exchange and validate their public keys.

I have always been in the top 5% of my class, but mostly as a result of conformity and self-discipline. I always, unconsciously, knew I have to get somewhere. Which is why I tend to compare myself with who I was at a certain point in my past and with others in order to keep a record of where I am on the road to \u2026? And that precisely is my dilemma: on the road to what?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>After obtaining a BA in Communication and PR I started to analyze what I had been doing those years and what was it that I wanted to do next. \u00a0Once you graduate from university, people expect you to jump right into the market. It turned out the field simply did not suit me, for reasons it would take too long to enumerate here. \u00a0I figured a large part of my problem would be solved if I could just find what I really liked. So I decided, based on my extra-curricular activity, the fact that I was always being recruited by professors to work on projects, as well as based on the role models I have that I want to be a researcher, preferably an academic one, in political science. I learned how to analyze and integrate social data, I went to conferences, got in touch with scientific communities, wrote a nice MA thesis, but to be able to, for example, find out the calculus of voting, it takes decades and you risk of ending up being mediocre. \u00a0Anyway, embarking on that means I would have to get a PhD, start writing seriously and most importantly, publish! But like probably most things in life, I find out this is damn hard.</span><span>\u00a0Especially if your standard for achievement is so high not even your professors meet it. So go find other models and an educational system that can push you where you think you want to be pushed. But that means calculating chances of getting in a prestigious university, competing with other people who in your mind are much brighter than you, and leaving behind other intimate aspirations. That is where I am now, attempting to make a decision: either being nothing but a professional with all my engines on and what I call home \u2013 the people I love, my hobbies and a comfortable life in which I perform little less than expected.</span>\n\n<span>In the meantime, I try to get around this using intermediate channels \u2013 voluntary work, internships \u2013 and building other types of experiences and relationships with work. But none of them are long term, so it is still me who has to decide eventually.</span><span>\u00a0No matter how adulthood will turn out, I hope my transition will be a worthy one, but as seen through my own eyes and not the lens of a society based on all sorts of criteria \u2013 status, money etc. \u00a0My criteria at present is peacefulness of mind \u2013 a satisfactory balance between what I could have done and what I eventually did, with all compromises and regrets involved. Why aiming for that result? Because my mind wanders too much, I feel like I have to factor in all sorts of variables \u2013 personal aspirations, family background, societal context, opportunities, skills and experience I already accumulated and would not want to throw off the window for the UNKNOWN.. and that for me is the sweetness and sourness of transition. But at a certain point in life what I want is to only keep the sweetness and let go of sourness.</span>\n\n<span>Finally, I think this writing exercise is challenging because it requires introspection. Nonetheless, its effects can be highly rewarding because once you are done with it (the writing, that is, not the rest of it) you feel like you can officially begin to look for wonderful resources to help you learn how to make choices. I am here to do just that.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>-- UPDATE 1 year and a half\u00a0later: I'm 26 and things look a little better. I realised I want to live in Cluj and I am no longer at crossroads.. Managed to yank myself out of a lot of anxiety and smile a little more. My standards are a little more precious and I'm less competitive when it comes to meeting standards that I can't really say are brewed within.\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-16 21:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:54:53.423529", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1096, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32724, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 869, "post_number": 20, "raw": "i like this one", "created_at": "2011-10-12 12:53:09", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:40:22.198398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15006, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4090, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>That's the spirit</b>\n\nWish you all a productive (and fun) time in Matera again.

Patient get weak, lost appetite and doesn't have no much time for living, \u00a0It's a kind of catalyst inside body.\u00a0\n\nBut this dandelion's \u00a0roots hunt and kill all cancerous cells inside body. \u00a0After you recognize that patient is completely cured, all we have to do is care about wound healing leave by the cancer inside the body. We can keep doing it by natural method using garlic. \u00a0Take one glass of hot water, \u00a0scratch 3 or 4 peaces of garlic and put it inside the glass of hot water. \u00a0Leave it for one night and drink it before breakfast, \u00a0keep do it until its gone, \u00a0or you can still buy some medecines in drug store if you want to heal \u00a0wound leaved by cancer.\n\n\u00a0I hope that everyone can find a way to cure and fight cancer on his own natural or chimical.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, any suggestions or critics please don't hesitate to write bellow\u00a0\n\nDear friends Edgeryders, I wish an Happy and successful new year to each every one of you.:-)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-04 19:12:10", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:27:12.093462", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 724, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4093, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 4060, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Can thinking about markets help design systems for stewardship?</strong>\n\nThe LOTE4 conference in Matera was centered on stewardship, but often the focus was drawn towards stewardship\u2019s capitalist cousin, the \u2018sharing economy\u2019. Perhaps Zipcar founder <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/112493351\">Robin Chase</a> (@rmchase) nudged us in that direction.  \n\nShe anchored her session with a neat definition of the sharing economy as activity using \u2018excess capacity\u2019. In the hackneyed AirBnB example (apologies - I\u2019ll be using this as well understood example all the way through), the excess capacity is people\u2019s unused spare rooms, which AirBnB turns into socially beneficial resources -- but there are Silicon Valley startups trying to do the same for everything from photography equipment to dog sitting. In the same session, she also introduced the notion of market failure in the sharing economy.\n\nIn this post I want to use this idea of the market to highlight the differences between stewardship and the sharing economy, and think about how Robin\u2019s idea of market failure can help design tools for non-profit collaboration such as stewardship. \n\nThe language of markets and economies wasn\u2019t warmly received at the conference, perhaps because it recalls financial catastrophe and spiraling inequality. More of the same, not part of the hunger for something new that was imminent and immanent in the caves of the unmonastery. \n\n<a href=\"http://suitpossum.blogspot.co.uk/\">Brett Scott</a> muses on connected issues in his book \u2018Hacking the Future of Money\u2019, asking readers to \u2018put on finance goggles\u2019 to take up \u2018economic circuit bending\u2019. This captures something important, an idea, like Robin\u2019s, that you can use the tools of economics even if you want to achieve something that\u2019s radically new. \n\nI think of <strong>stewardship</strong> as a DIY bricolage of barter, altruism and tradition, perhaps with shades of a conventional business model or public funding in the mix too. It transcends public and private sectors. \n\nIt\u2019s a response to a perception that the public sector is remote, unable to adapt to local conditions, missing the cohesive effect that comes from a community doing things for itself.  A sense of an impending, epochal failure in the public sector was woven into the fabric of discussions at LOTE.\n\nThe <strong>sharing economy</strong> belongs with the \u2018smart city\u2019 - both terms do double service as marketing jargon that belie corporate interests, while also usefully denoting a real phenomena. \n\nThere is a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/92c3021c-34c2-11e3-8148-00144feab7de.html#axzz3PN9eZ4Us\">strand of thought</a>, discussed at LOTE, that connects the sharing economy with the increasingly precarious and unfair economic structure we currently endure. I can buy into the idea that the sharing economy is a consequence of a neo-liberal economic agenda, but not so much that it\u2019s a cause -- equality or job security wouldn\u2019t be improved if AirBnB shut down tomorrow. \n\nWe also thought about the sharing economy \u2018crowding out\u2019 previously altruistic acts - offering a friend a bed for the night etc. As some who let my spare room a lot through AirBnB, I could never have afforded to do that altruistically. Robin suggested that the sheer number of transactions Zipcar sees mean there must be something more than just substitution going on. \n\nWhatever your conclusions about the ethics of the sharing economy - and I realise the political debate has a lot of subtlety to it that I haven\u2019t gone into - it\u2019s interesting to think about the crossover with notions of stewardship.\n\nThat crossover is in taking fragmentary bits of excess capacity and making them socially useful. But if you look through \u2018market goggles\u2019, they are also radically different. \n\n<strong>Failure in the market for spare rooms (sharing economy)</strong> happens if someone who wanted to let a room, and someone who would have like to stayed in that room, fail to find each other. It could also fail if two people who let out rooms could swap and both be happier - this is thinking about the sharing economy in terms of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency\">Pareto efficiency</a>. \n\nWe can see how different stewardship is. Take the example of a library closing down. <strong>Market failure for stewardship</strong> happens if people in community have spare time they would like to use running the library, perhaps tailoring it to their local needs, but don\u2019t realise that they could do so, or if a number of individuals realise separately, but never meet each other. \n\nMy work, <a href=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/phd/\">looking at asset mapping of communities through social media</a>, tries to solve some of this problem: generating information about what resources there are in the community, and who is interested in supporting them. Much of the information is out there, but dissipated across many weakly interconnected networks. The problem is to liberate it.  \n\nIn the imaginary library we need to ensure fairness. Volunteers might start to feel it was unfair if someone used the library every day but never contributed. In this case they might ask them to help out. Perhaps we want to waive this rule for people who are too old to easily to volunteer, or perhaps someone wants to contribute by giving books instead of spare time. \n\nOne of the problems discussed a LOTE is that often stewardship projects are powered by one person who makes a heroic contribution and then burns out -- another issue of fairness. To be sustainable, people who make large contributions need some kind of recompense to support themselves. \n\nThis conversation about who contributes and benefits could be very difficult to settle, but this give and take is exactly the problem that market type mechanisms are designed to solve. \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s very similar to the problem that @matthias\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.makerfox.com/\">Makerfox</a> solves, by giving abstract, non-monetary value to goods and services and algorithmically solving the demand and supply problem. Maybe money is part of the mix, maybe it isn\u2019t. For example, exchanging money for human organs is illegal in most countries, but economists still like to think about a market and how to make that market work as well as it can - and <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21564836-alvin-roth-and-lloyd-shapley-have-won-year%E2%80%99s-nobel-economics\">win Nobel prizes for doing so</a>. \n\nYou could solve these market problems with vouchers or local currencies, but as AirBnB or Makerfox demonstrate, web platforms have a big part to play in reducing friction and making these markets more efficient. Stewardship is a fuzzy concept, and the many permutations of fairness norms and conceptions of value, time, money and goods mean that many implementations are possible. \n\nIn it\u2019s most philosophical sense, this is using the information processing and sharing power of the web to solve <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_knowledge_problem\">Hayek\u2019s knowledge problem</a> without resorting (exclusively) to money.  \n\n \n\nWhich brings us to what I felt was the most thoughtful objection to economic thinking - @patrick_andrews's idea that assigning abstract numerical value, the value of clean air in dollars or a volunteer\u2019s time in euros, is intrinsically immoral or amoral. Thinking through this ethical problem is clearly a part of the design process. This is not something (all) economists are oblivious to, with Edward and Robert Skidelsky making an interesting recent contribution with a <a href=\"http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/are-markets-moral-edward-skidelsky/?K=9781137472731\">book</a> and  <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/videoAndAudio/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/player.aspx?id=2814\">LSE lecture</a> considering the issue. \n\nWhether a market analysis appeals or not, it may well be an effective way to communicate with policy makers, for whom market based thinking often comes naturally. When justifying public expenditure, quantifiable benefits are very powerful, even if we know that qualitative outcome is what matters. \n\nI would prefer that letting spare rooms could have been solved in an open, not for profit way - but that hasn\u2019t happened. Even so, the fact that AirBnB works so well means that people are using the excess capacity in housing better than they were before. \n\nPlatforms will surely evolve to increase the use of stewardship (perhaps by a different name), there are already lots of promising starts in the area. But, unlike AirBnB, these systems will have a more open and participatory ethos, since that ethos lies at the core of stewardship itself. \n\nMoving beyond technology to consider the systemic issues of politics and ethics requires multiple perspectives, and \u2018market goggles\u2019 are an excellent tool for understanding systems of value exchange like stewardship.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/61823ec8fde555ccef0d297de404538c8fcc81cb.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>", "created_at": "2015-01-22 12:46:22", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 07:28:50.016911", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1478, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 61.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6585, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2210, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Short notice...</b>\n\nAw, too much of a short notice for me, unfortunately!

Most people did not anticipate their widespread adoption, and certainly did not consider their subtle social implications; but for those who did, perhaps the most haunting fear about their probable dissemination was the certainty that the social and psychological changes they engendered would quickly become the new status quo, unnoticed and unquestioned.\n\nPassing through Kobenhavn airport this morning, a digital advertising screen promoted this month\u2019s \u2018Presidents Summit\u2019 on the topic of \u2018<a href=\"http://avt.dk/en/events/presidents-summit-disruption/\">Disruption</a>\u2019: \u201cDisruption will change your job. Disruption will change your company. Disruption will change the world. Join our world leading summit and learn how to lead the change and make sure you are one of tomorrow's frontrunners.\u201d\n\nThat the idea of \u2018disruption\u2019 has moved from the radical edge of digital culture and post-2008 political insurgency to the topic of a plenary meeting of senior executives \u2013 featuring speeches by Apple\u2019s Steve Wozniak and arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage \u2013 shows the degree to which the concept has spread through society to become the \u2018new normal\u2019; a sign, perhaps, of just how much the pace of social, technological and economic change has increased since I fretted about the novel impact of moving images on the urban populace.\n\nBut it also raises the question of how much of this disruption is merely cosmetic \u2013 or, rather, how much the very genuine disruption of ordinary lives only serves to bolster the established iniquities of our current economic and political status quo. If disruption is merely another business opportunity from the playbook of \u2018creative destruction\u2019 capitalism, if the elite response to it is simply to fight harder to be one of \u2018tomorrow\u2019s frontrunners\u2019 (while those who can\u2019t keep up must, presumably, be left behind), then perhaps this is merely another case of <em>plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose</em>.\n\nIf so, what would genuine disruption look like? Is it possible that it might look like the opposite of all this? That it might look like a rejection of these kinds of disruption? The stories emerging from the OpenCare initiative suggest that this may be the case. Again and again, the tales that emerge are of a less hierarchical, more empowering approach to health and care; of individualised, human-scale responses to unique instances of wider social problems; of a movement away from the paradigm that measures \u2018efficiency\u2019 of care in terms of speed, throughput or numbers discharged \u2013 measured, in short, on how fast the system can cease to be in relationship with the citizens who have sought aid.\n\nTrue disruption, then, might not look like the world-spanning, high-octane revolutions beloved of the senior executives. It might look like slowness; like quietness; like a return to engagement at the scale of the human being. It might just turn out that old is the new new.\n\nMy own involvement with OpenCare stems from a very particular form of healthcare, based on something very old, small and quiet \u2013 the Community Multibed Acupuncture Clinic (CMAC).\n\n<a name=\"docs-internal-guid-6ddc05b4-e780-7761-4bce-3a38993987b6\"></a> Community Acupuncture is a new version of an old format of providing a very old form of medicine \u2013 using traditional East Asian methods, it eschews the one-to-one treatments most common in the West, instead adapting the traditional Chinese model of treating multiple patients at once in the same room. This enables treatment to be offered more cheaply, as well as creating a shared space of communal healing, so that healthcare becomes a site of community empowerment. There are now over 170 such clinics in the US and more than 50 in the UK (you can read about their history and ethos on the websites of <a href=\"https://www.pocacoop.com/\">POCA</a> and <a href=\"http://acmac.net/acu/pro/\">ACMAC</a>).\n\nAs I detailed in my original Opencare <a href=\"/t/community-acupuncture-an-ongoing-mutation/638\">blog post</a>, I have been slowly evolving a CMAC of my own to serve a small and somewhat dysfunctional market town in the South-West of the UK. Through this process, a number of tough lessons and intriguing insights have emerged, with broader implications for the innovative provision of care in contemporary European societies.\n\nI subtitled my initial post \u201cAn Ongoing Mutation\u201d both in reference to the <a href=\"http://www.communichi.org/a-very-brief-history-of-community-acupuncture-in-america/\">overall development of the approach in the West</a> and to my own experience of developing a clinic. This experience has been one of trial and error, of creative response to practical and bureaucratic challenges, and of constant adaptation to feedback from \u2013 and through ongoing relationship with \u2013 the community; as I learn more about their needs and perspective, I have changed the way I am treating, the way I interact with patients, the hours treatment is offered and the venue it is offered in.\n\nTo ask, as a state bureaucrat convinced of the usefulness of CMACs might, \u201chow can we replicate this so that we can roll it out across the country at an official level?\u201d rather misses the point; it is precisely by being embedded in the community that this process of creative mutation can occur, and precisely by meeting patients outside the usual structures of state-sanctioned medical authority that a more horizontal trust and respect can be created, and a more creative approach to healthcare provision enacted.\n\nLike many of the other projects featured in OpenCare, the flexibility of Community Acupuncture \u2013 light on infrastructure, expensive medical equipment or architectural requirements, reliant instead on the portable diagnostic and treatment skills of the practitioner \u2013 makes it well-suited to navigating a disrupted present and an uncertain future. Quite aside from its effectiveness at treating unexplained and chronic conditions (the kind mainstream Western medicine does not excel at curing), having the ability to treat without reliance on fragile, resource-intensive and environmentally-damaging industrial supply chains may well prove to be a great asset in the near future. Indeed, the worth of this is already being proven through the work of charitable foundations like <a href=\"http://www.worldmedicine.org.uk/\">World Medicine</a>, who have set up successful CMACs in poor, rural areas of India, Palestine, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\nProblems still remain, not least with the institutional resistance to acupuncture \u2013 often based on little more than ill-informed prejudice against \u2018alternative\u2019 medicine. There are clashes within the acupuncture community, as well, on <a href=\"http://liberationacupuncture.org/\">how best to treat</a>, and issues with providing quality-assurance and redress to patients whilst working outside the usual channels and institutions of healthcare.\n\nNevertheless, the popularity and effectiveness of CMACs speak for themselves. All too often, the state-established institutions of care remain locked into a post-imperial perspective, treating the body, the patient or the polis as the passive subject of a homogenised, top-down intervention.\n\nIt is a little like a digital advertising screen, broadcasting a single, one-way message to a public who have no choice but to receive it. Just like a digital advertising screen, this kind of healthcare can seem cutting-edge, innovative and technologically impressive, but its values do not respect the uniqueness of individual or place, nor do they promote communal solidarity and empowerment. So long as this is the case, communities will continue to vote with their feet, seeking out new forms of adaptive Open Care that address their real mental, physical and social needs.\n\n***\n\nI would love to see Community Acupuncture being integrated with some of the other projects and approaches detailed in OpenCare; to hear suggestions about how the CMAC model could be further improved and evolved; and, as ever, I am keen for people to educate themselves about acupuncture, to help fight against the misguided myths that have arisen about it, and to spread the word about this affordable, effective, environmentally-friendly and humane form of medicine!\n\nSteve Wheeler, Lic.

Inform the organisations where you volunteer that this is where your heart is, and ask them if there is a way to financially support your engagement. Offer to assist them with fundraising strategies that would raise enough money to pay you.\n\nNever stop believing in yourself. Keep your dream very close to your heart, and if this is what you love to do, you will attract the right circomstances that will help you materialize your goals. But in order to do this, you really must believe in what you want to become. It has to come from the deep deep down inside, you see, for everyone around you to feel your passion, and be absolutely convinced that you are the one they need to do the job.\n\nYou probably won't make millions, but you will lead a <span><span>satisfying life</span> <span>that will bring</span> <span>you</span> <span>closer to</span> <span>what</span> <span>you are.</span> <span>You will have the</span> opportunity <span>to</span> <span>develop yourself</span> <span>to your</span> <span>maximum capacities</span><span>,</span> <span>to find</span> <span>your</span> <span>life purpose</span> <span>and</span> <span>discover your unique</span> <span>talents</span><span>.</span> <span>You will tend </span> <span>to the</span> <span>highest vision</span> <span>of your being</span><span>.</span></span>\n\nPlease please please please please, do yourself a favor: erase this thought from your mind, '<em>I actually hate money</em>'.

This went unchallenged, with the exception of one Icelandic guy who suggested no one is really in control.\n\nHere's why I have problems with this attitude.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>It is plain wrong. Megascale phenomena (globalization, global warming, the rise of the car civilization...), to the best of my knowledge, are best explained as emergent processes: very many actors, each trying to get to their own goal within the constraints of the situation as they perceive it, recreate the situation. No one ever <em>intended</em> to heat the planet: people were just burning coal, because, you know, other people wanted to buy that energy. And those people, the buyers, they needed it to turn it into goods and servics that still <em>other </em>people wanted to buy, and so on. Global warming is quite elegantly framed as an an emergent property of the fossile-fuel economy. A similar argument can be developed for The Crisis, however defined.</li>\n\n<li>Like many conspiracy theories, it is politically so attractive that it is very hard not to suspect it to be intellectually dishonest. Hey, this is not our fault! It's the Cabal's fault! It's the Black Chamber. It's the witches in 17th century Europe. Hitler, a master political communicator, blamed hyperinflation and mass unemployment in Germany in the early 1930s on wealthy (Jewish) industrialists and bankers. This plays on very well known cognitive psychology results (check out Nobel laureates Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky): we are hardwired to react to easy, powerful narratives. The conspiracy is one such narrative. It appeals to our ape brains and absolves us on all responsibilities: politically, a killer product. Leaders (or would-be leaders) must find it very difficult to resist to the temptation to use it. And, T, don't tell me there are not people who want to be leaders of 15-M, because there clearly are... though your movement does have antibodies against leaderism.</li>\n\n<li>It leads back to the traditional political system. Ok, so it's not us, it's them, right? Nothing we can do about it, short of a dystopian mass elimination of the 1% (1% of the world population = 70 million people = 12 Holocausts). So we need to exert indirect pressure on them: change the law/the tax laws/the Constitution/whatever. All potentially good things, but they imply building political infrastructure: parties, pressure groups, media etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the idea, but most of what I heard in Barcelona pointed to an irreducible diversity of the movement with respect to traditional politics. I would contend that such a diversity is not really compatible with a \"not our fault\" kind of approach.</li>\n\n</ol>All this is exquisitely old fashioned. The environmentalist movement went that way in the 80s, and it had far better theoretical tools. I am told the same happened to the ultraleftist movement in the 70s, but I was too young for politics then. Quite unpleasantly, these movements generated small number of leaders who were coopted into the \u00e9lites, becoming members of parliament, government officials, academics. The supporters, they were, again, reduced to number, waiting for the next liberation movement.\n\nWhich brings me to direct constructive action: people trying to hack away at the problem, one facet at a time. This is where my heart is, and why I think Edgeryders is important: it exposes the tentative solutions that young people are working on.\n\nI remember that the Madrid unrest started out with a focus on the problem of housing. We have a killer piece on Edgeryders: Vinay, telling us about himself <a href=\"/t/the-subtle-art-of-precarity/1250\">working in a city he can't afford to live in</a>. Do you think you and/or somebody from the movement would be interested in participating to the discussion? Any good solutions?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-11 11:07:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.358943", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 714, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18452], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22313, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1412, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>You remembered!</b>\n\nThanks Aubrey, I'm checking that out for sure!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-26 08:26:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.257467", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4551, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4518, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In the past few weeks two interesting proposals for LOTE5 have come up:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Athens, proposed by <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>\u00a0and centered on\u00a0Social Cohesion - Survival Strategies (<a href=\"/t/living-on-the-edge-5-athens-late-september-2015/4448\">read the post</a>).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Brussels, proposed by <a href=\"/u/ireinga\">@ireinga</a>\u00a0and centered on failure (they prefer to call it \"Fuckup\", actually \u2013 <a href=\"/t/brussels-fuckupmoods-lote-5/4491\">read the post</a>)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThese are both interesting because both build on the strength of an existing community within the broader Edgeryders space. The Athens proposal is driven by a group of veterans of unMonastery Matera; the Brussels one by the Antiheroes movement. Both groups can count on a proven ability to deliver, (wo)manpower, presence on the ground and even some access to local partners and possibly sponsors. Finally, they are both definitely \"on the edge\".\n\nThey also have differences. Locations are very different; Athens is cheaper to stay in, Brussels cheaper and easier to get to, for most of us. Athens is definitely more \"at the edge of Europe\", while Brussels can offer more opportunities to partner up with local businesses and to build bridges to institutions. An Athens solution might appeal more to the hardcore Edgeryders community; a Brussels solution might attract more of the people who have been watching us with interest and are considering dipping a foot in the water. The mood also seems to be different; darker, more urgent for the unMonastery crowd, more fearless in a light-hearted kind of way for the AntiHeroes ladies (though this is just a personal impression). Finally, the Athens proposal has the advantage to be more in line with LOTE3 and LOTE4, which were both invested in the unMonastery as a flagship project; the Brussels proposal has the advantage of investing in a new initiative, that has been developing separately so far but could now seek closer ties with Edgeryders.\n\nAdditionally, we have a problem that concerns both proposals. Edgeryders LBG is, as always, committed to supporting LOTE events, but we are struggling with a lenghty handover of financial and legal records from Arthur (following his resignation as director in mid-April) to those of us who remain on the board. We had been meaning to have this conversation in February, and hire a conference coordinator right away, but we have been prevented to do so: it sounds and is really stupid, but we don't have control of our bank account. We are not even sure how much money is there. This is being solved, but it may take several weeks before we can make an informed decision as to investing in LOTE5. We may even have to reschedule, from the traditional fall to early 2016.\u00a0\n\nGiven all that, how should we (where \"we\" means \"the Edgeryders community\") move forward? Attempt to reconcile the two proposals? Make a choice among them? Skip a year? Do something else entirely?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-11 12:54:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.634661", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 522, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2201, 251, 2967], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31650, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 2512, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Error...my bad...</b>\n\nSorry...

Often all it takes is interest and a fun, supportive and socially engaging approach.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b8aff2d7c975431525e2d50f7471c7894a45093d.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<em>Instagram from OpenTechSchool workshop for kids on Arduino Day.</em>\n\nWith OpenTechSchool, I'm hosting a series of workshops on topics in which people in Matera have communicated interest. While initially taking an open, project-based approach, I've found it helps to offer concrete topics of interest and take specific project development from there.\n\nHowever, it's been difficult to get off the ground, despite hosting several workshops a week. Ultimately it takes some time to establish a school, let alone one development project, in the space of 2 months. Specific challenges have been the English-Italian language difficulty and the lack of a clear and targeted channel(s) of communication.\n\nI'm posting here a series of workshops I've planned for the next few weeks that aim to incorporate some of the interests of Materani, as well as bolster projects initiated at the unMonastery, including unMonastery Analytics and the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/mapping-the-commons\" target=\"_blank\">Mapping the Commons</a> collective effort.\n\n<strong>It would be of enormous help to have the workshop descriptions and <a href=\"/t/opentechschool-matera/569/call-for-collaborators\" target=\"_blank\">call for collaborators</a> translated into Italian so that I could make a clear communication push and share the calendar. Of course, any contributions and suggestions to the workshops would be more than welcome!</strong>\n\nThank you for your help. I greatly look forward to getting to know the Edgeryders community more and lending a hand in turn. :)\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>OpenTechSchool Matera workshop topics</strong>\n\n<strong>Open Studio</strong>\n\nCome enjoy the weekend at an OpenTechSchool Matera studio session. Bring your plans and ideas, and we\u2019ll give you the technical support to realize your projects.

Visualize it!</strong>\n\nWith terms like big data, data-driven journalism, and open data getting lots of attention these days, it\u2019s time for you to see what it\u2019s all about! If you have data of your own - whether it\u2019s accounting spreadsheets or Facebook data - bring the files, or use the unMonastery analytics to learn data visualization. Using technologies like Gephi and D3, experiment with giving your data easy-to-read meaning.\n\n<strong>Create your own website (previously translated)</strong>\n\nWant an online portfolio? A website for your project? A blog to talk with friends? In two workshops, get a website online and learn how to customize it to your needs.\u00a0Learn how to get a website up and running, and customize your site to host content like images and videos.\u00a0Workshops are free and open to anyone. While a few laptops are available for use, please try to bring your own computer. Workshops are held at the unMonastery, which is located at\n\n<strong>Learn to Geo-Map!</strong>\n\nAs part of Mapping the Commons(link) collaboration project, attend this workshop where we\u2019ll go over three different techniques of mapping, using OpenStreetMaps and applications like Ramblr. Easily add media, like video and sound, to your favorite parts of Matera, or trace your favorite walk through the city. In two weeks time, there will be a follow-up workshop to upload everyone\u2019s data to maps of the city!\n\n<strong>Collaborate\u2014the open source way!</strong>\n\nAn introductory workshop on Git and using GitHub, the destination for open source software collaboration.

It all started as a social enterprise having become one of the winners of \\#KolbaLabs (http://kolbalabs.am/en/) and now the idea goes dipper and dipper to peel all the possible layers of the bigger picture.\u00a0\n\nMy idea is to unite a community based not only on interests or needs but first of all on the social role - being a mom. As I mentioned in my presentation at the Edgeryders event n Yerevan, yes, it's a kind of MomMonastry referring to the wonderful example of unMonastry. It is now starting in Armenia but I have the vision to spread the model beyond borders via virtual tools. I'm ready to talk about it and also will be happy to see some support in the audience; we could start the global community and actions with some volunteers from \\#Lote4 :) By the time of the event, the first steps in form of actions will be on the go, so even if I don't get into the ship of participants, I'll be following online and will be more active on the net.\u00a0\n\nSome more details can be found in the Edgeryders video made several months ago, though more developed and defined now -\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/futurespotters-video-interview-seda-papoyan-in-yerevan-armenia.\n\nBtw, I'm also interested in open source software and open data, just for you to know :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-23 05:51:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.396137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 291, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23843, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 4784, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Be happy to do it</b>\n\nIf you're happy for me to represent the Edgeryders vibes!

We and the girls had a girls-night-out. Sex in the City first movies was being screened in the cinema and though I was not a big fan of Carrie Bradshaw and her gang, I gladly accepted the invitation. We had some drinks and cakes in a downtown Chisinau bakery (no doubts, some of us were visualizing themselves in a stylish Manhattan pastry shop serving elegant European desserts and best cappuccino), chatted, giggled and headed towards the cinema. The movie was quite positive and it was the girls who made it better, funnier, and sexier altogether. I exited the theater and was really in this happy, pinky mood I would say. My boyfriend (now my husband) was waiting for me so that we could continue the night out together. I kissed the girls goodbye and couldn\u2019t stop smiling. He took my hand and told me: I have some really bad news. Skakun passed away!</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Skakun was a family friend. I mean we were never friends, \u2018cause he was my parents\u2019 age and my parents\u2019 friend. But he was such a common guest in our house also because he was a neighbor. I was shocked \u2013 I am sure it was a common shock of a person learning about someone\u2019s death: you start realizing that he will never be around, no more visits, calls, laughs, fights etc. This realization of FATALITY overwhelms you.</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">This is how my obsessive fear of death was born. I realized that anytime of the day, rainy or sunny, winter or summer, good mood or bad, you can get a CALL. From that day on, I realized every time I would get a call on my cell from a family member, my heart started beating like crazy. Every time I heard a family member telling me: I\u2019ve got some bad news for you, I would start trembling epileptically and after hearing the \u201cbad\u201d news, I would usually burst into a hysterical cry. The situation got even worse after I gave birth to my son and in 3 months got back to the office. My mind was \u201ccompressed\u201d during the whole business day. After working hours I was running home to find him safe and sound and that was the happy moment of the day.</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Today I think I can control my fear and the whole situation has improved significantly. And this happened thanks to communication mostly. I have realized that my husband, my friends, my mates at work\u2026we all think about death, we all fear it, we all think of it as a nightmare\u2026sometimes we simply give up thinking, \u2018cause our brain explodes! I do not think I have yet established a clear relationship, attitude towards this black lady\u2026although I believe this is the only way to supersede this brain-eating fear!</h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Every night, before going to bed, I kiss his little feet (I am in love with his toes) and think to myself: this is <strong>NOW</strong>, this is <strong>LIFE</strong>, and this is \u201c<strong>HAPPY</strong>\u201d!</h2>", "created_at": "2012-05-10 09:14:44", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 10:39:53.825710", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 549, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20963, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1065, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Yes, but what about Cyprus itself?</b>\n\nSo,\u00a0Joel, welcome!\n\nAs Noemi says, several of us are interested in problems similar to those you list <a href=\"http://www.opencyprus.org/call-for-papers/\">here</a>.

I carry out my activities with two associations based in Venice: the free Italian language school \"Liberalaparola\" and a network of local organization called \"Tutti i diritti umani per tutti\" (All human rights for everybody). As activists and volunteers we share the same values and the belief that human rights and dignity are common goods, are the \"pillars\" of a democratic and fair society. Nowadays in Italy and in Europe we can see a continuous process of social exclusion and deprivation of rights that penalize in particular immigrants and, at the same time, we can see an increase of xenophobic and racist groups and parties. The strong and dangerous link among \"institutional\" racism, \"mass media\" racism and \"popular\" racism makes the life of many migrants an exhausting and never-ending \"high-hurdle\" in every moment of their life.\n\n<strong>Network of local organizations \"Tutti i diritti umani per tutti\": </strong>four years ago a group of local NGO's and organizations that work in Venice on the fields of human rights and migration decided to join together to carry out campaigns and activities to promote human rights for migrants and minorities and to fight against racism and human rights' violations. The first action was a campaign to support Sinti (Italian Rroma community) against racism and attacks made mainly by Lega Nord (an Italian racist political party); the following years many efforts of this network have been directed towards the topic of the violation of human rights and the deportation inside the maritime port of Venice, where many migrants (mostly youngsters) come after a terrible and highly-risky travel from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kurdistan, Turkey and Greece. The Italian border police in most cases sends these migrants back to Greece where they are tortured and detained; many youngsters\u00a0 try to hide themselves inside the cruise liners that go from Greece to Italy and some of them don't survive. These migrants should have the right to get a lawyer and a interpreter to ask for asylum or simply to get the basic information when they arrive in Italy. But most part of them don't have these rights so we inform the citizens about that situation organizing meetings and events (also inside the schools) and, at the same time, we put pressure on police insitutions and political institutions denouncing what is happening and asking for a change because the violation of human rights inside the port of Venice is going on and we think that in a (so-called) democratic country it isn't acceptable such situation. From last summer we've started also to help african migrants coming from Libya - escaped because of the war - giving them different kinds of support such Italian language courses, translations, information about the procedures to ask for asylum; in addition to it, we've collected their complaints and their requests when the host organizations haven't given them the basic services and help; for this reasons we are permanently in contact with local institutions and organizations as \"observers\" with the aim of giving voice to african migrants that are living a hard situation here in Italy.\n\n<strong>Free italian language school \"Liberalaparola\"</strong>: we think that one of the most important rights is the right to learn the language of the country where you live. The free Italian language school \"Liberalaparola\" is part of the network \"Tutti i diritti umani per tutti\". It has 30 teachers (all volunteers) and gives to more than one hundred migrants this right organizing free Italian language courses for everybody. The social and political meaning of our school is given by two facts: we don't ask for documents (and we are nearly the only ones that do it here in Venice) and we consider our students as people and friends. We teach them and at the same time we learn a lot from them. We organize events where they have the chance to teach us their languages; once a week we have a theatrical workshop where we play both some \"theatre of the oppressed\" excercise and some creative language games; we arrange public events to promote our activities and to denounce laws and facts that are unfair and discriminatory towards migrants; we organize anti-racist football tournaments and also intercultural dinner.\u00a0 The events are organized inside a social center called \"Rivolta\", a plural and free space where many activists and volunteers join together to fight against fascism and racism.\n\nThe network \"Tutti i diritti umani per tutti\" and the free Italian language school \"Liberalaparola\" (that is part of the network) share the same approach that I can define as a \"large scale project\" because our general purpose is asserting and promoting human rights for migrants and sensitizing public awareness about topic such anti-racism and anti-discrimination. The basic idea that we want to promote is that we must consider migrants as \"people\" with their dignity and their rights because for us they are not slaves, criminals, low-cost workforce, invaders or \"clandestini\" as many Italian politicians and mass media like to state and repeat.\n\nIf we are aware of it, we can build up a society without prejudices, fears and ignorance. And we can understand that human rights either are for everybody or are for nobody!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-12 11:53:59", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 04:09:28.257222", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 909, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1269, "user_id": 103, "topic_id": 1236, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nHey y'all, I was interviewed not too long ago, and the interview makes a nice \"Share my Ryde\" report. \u00a0-Neal\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Question: You have an\u00a0<a href=\"http://shareable.net/users/neal-gorenflo\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0); \" target=\"_self\">impressive bio</a>, and you mention that you\u2019re \u201cperhaps an unlikely voice for sharing.\u201d What inspired you to leave the corporate world behind?</strong>\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Answer:\u00a0</strong>Well, the short story is that I was not enjoying myself!

I went for a jog in a nearby industrial park on a sunny summer day. I stopped in the empty parking lot of a warehouse. I was totally alone at one of the most important crossroads of the global economy \u2014 Brussels, home of the European Union \u2014 and I began to cry.\n\nI realized that this was not the life I wanted, and also \u2014 and this made me really bawl \u2014 that millions of people are probably not digging it either. I had grokked the global economy, really felt it in my bones actually, and just felt a big NO. No bad relationships, overwork, purposelessness, and destruction of nature and community.\n\nWhat was weird to me \u2014 the corporate strategist \u2014 was that this was not an intellectual decision. In the back of my mind, I knew these things already. I just hadn\u2019t felt them in my bones until then. I had connected to something bigger than myself. And it became crystal clear what I had to do.\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Q: OK, you said no to the corporate life. What did you say yes to?</strong>\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">A:</strong>\u00a0I made a vow \u2014 right then and there in that parking lot \u2014 to do whatever I could to create a life of purpose, great relationships and real community. And to help others do the same.\n\nImmediately after this, I went to my office, submitted my resignation and re-booked my reservations for the next flight home. I started working on sharing projects within days of touching down. I had no plan. I had something much more powerful: total commitment. I just dove in. I had absolutely no reservations about this decision at the time or to this day. It\u2019s the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Q: What does sharing have to do with relationships?</strong>\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">A:</strong>\u00a0Everything! It\u2019s impossible to have good relationships unless you have an economic system that supports them. The economy, in fact, shapes the types of relationships we have with one another.\n\nAnd sharing creates great relationships. When you share, you simultaneously affirm a bond with another person, the larger community and with the earth. I say \u201cwith the earth\u201d because sharing is good stewardship of resources.\n\nIn contrast, a wasteful, stress-filled, work-and-spend McLifestyle works against good relationships. And you can\u2019t thrive without good relationships. Good relationships are a key ingredient to happiness. We should put them first in our lives, but also create public policy that supports healthy relationships.\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Q: What\u2019s the connection between simplicity, sharing and social change?</strong>\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">A:</strong>\u00a0Through simpler living, you can cut your costs, work less and spend your time on those things that give you the most satisfaction.

If you want to take simpler living to the next level, you have to work with others.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_25721\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; padding-top: 4px; border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); border-right-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); border-bottom-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); border-left-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 3px 3px; border-top-right-radius: 3px 3px; border-bottom-right-radius: 3px 3px; border-bottom-left-radius: 3px 3px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; width: 510px; \">\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.timesunion.com/simplerliving/files/2010/10/Abundance-League-November-2007.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: 700; \"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25721 \" height=\"281\" src=\"http://blog.timesunion.com/simplerliving/files/2010/10/Abundance-League-November-2007.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-color: initial; \" title=\"Photo by Neal Gorenflo\" width=\"500\"></a>One of the many social innovation salons I organized in San Francisco after I returned home.\n\n</div><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Q: Can you give some examples?</strong>\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">A:</strong>\u00a0There\u2019s two related paths. First, you can simplify your life even more by sharing. For instance, you can dramatically reduce the number of things you need to own by sharing. Shared housing, transportation, workspace, meals and food production can dramatically lower your costs while building community \u2014 the ultimate form of social security.\n\nAnd it\u2019s possible to create a whole lifestyle based on sharing without joining a commune. Car sharing, co-housing, co-working, yard sharing, bike sharing, tool sharing and other innovations are growing in popularity. And they do not require you to give up your privacy, individuality or even ownership of your stuff. New websites like\u00a0<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \"><a href=\"http://neighborgoods.net/\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0); \" target=\"_self\">NeighborGoods</a></strong>\u00a0can help you and your neighbors share in a way that protects your privacy and stuff.\n\nAnd second, the time you free up by sharing and living more simply can be used to get engaged in issues that affect your lifestyle. For instance, going car-free is a lot easier if there\u2019s plenty of bike lanes and good public transportation. These are community issues that you can\u2019t work toward alone. You have to get involved in your community to make sure your tax dollars are spent in ways that make simpler living possible.\n\n<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Neal Gorenflo is the publisher of\u00a0<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \"><a href=\"http://shareable.net/\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0); \" target=\"_self\">Shareable</a></strong>, an online magazine that promotes sharing as an empowering lifestyle choice and offers how-to tips.

Let\u2019s not fool ourselves here: this is a journey that never really ends, there is always that extra mile to go, that extra goal to reach, even for the older among us. And it is by no means easy: you\u2019ll have to ride a lot of edges. The good news is, you are not alone. We are all taking risks and, occasionally, ending up with bruises. Hopefully we can learn from each other, and in this way help each other a bit.\n\nThe is the first leg of the Edgeryders journey, and in many ways the most important. At whichever point in time you start Edgeryding we recommend you do Arrivals first.\u00a0\n\nIn Arrivals you do two things. First, you let your fellow Edgeryders know a little about yourself. If we are to learn from each other it is critical that we share our stories in a format that others can learn from \u2013 and perhaps help us as we move along. Second, you get to know them, or at least some of them; and, if you can, you offer them some useful advice or help. Often just having somebody who listens and asks the right questions can unlock new, interesting thoughts that help us to move forward!

It can be the story of your life\u2019s journey, or the story of a day when you discovered something important about yourself or the world. It can be about achieving something or about coming up against an obstacle that prevented you from achieving something. We are especially interested in how you are shaping your own life, making the transition from childhood/adolescence to adult life. The purpose of this mission is to enable Edgeryders to learn from each other\u2019s strategies, successes and mistakes, so don\u2019t be shy!\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a few tips to write an engaging story that other Edgeryders will be grateful for:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>tell us the facts, then your reflections upon the facts.</strong> \u201cI had a lucky break by stumbling on an interesting course while in high school\u201d is not so informative: \u201cMy technology professor in high school led a workshop in which we learned how to build a solar panel, and I discovered I was very interested in working with clean energy\u201d is better.</li>\n\n<li><strong>name one or a few goals that you feel you have achieved and that you are most proud of.</strong> This should tell us in which direction you have been moving as you navigate your life.</li>\n\n<li><strong>name one or a few goals you are currently trying to achieve now. </strong>Where are the difficulties in doing so? What would you need in order to resolve them?</li>\n\n<li><strong>provide information which would make it easier for the audience to map your story.</strong> Your age, education and social background are very useful pieces of contextual information.</li>\n\n<li><strong>you can make the story as long as you want. </strong>We recommend you make it as short as possible to make it easier for your fellow Edgeryders to read it, but not so short that you have to take out interesting parts! So far, \u00a0stories have been around 800 to 1100 words.</li>\n\n<li><strong>If you need to take inspiration you can do so from Edgeryders who have already written theirs</strong>, like [], [], [] and [].\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>as always in Edgeryders, you can write in any language you want</strong>, and readers can have it machine-translated at a click. But we recommend you write in English: most Edgeryders understand at least some English, and you will make it easier for them to learn from you and be inspired by your story. <strong>Don\u2019t worry about making mistakes: for most of us English is a foreign language, and we will make just as many mistakes as you.</strong> It\u2019s ok, the important thing is to understand each other.

On the web, where you can\u2019t very well hang out in a physical sense, that comes down to curating your profile so that it conveys a sense of who you are and what you are trying to do. Without this information, other Edgeryders will find it difficult to interact with you. You you can\u2019t get help if you don\u2019t ask for it; you can\u2019t forge an alliance if people don\u2019t know that you want to. Here's how:\n\nTo create or edit a user profile, click on your user name at the very top right of your window. You will be transported to this page (only if logged in).

As much as we\u2019d like to believe we are prepared, we discover things we were not taught in the classroom, such as dealing with work relations (often hierarchical); managing conflicts or competition; group dynamics that not only differ from our previous experience, but differ from one work place to another.\n\nThis is a mission touching upon the learning challenges and lessons of the first work, and asks that you describe an experience where you made the first step into any new work, learning for the first time \u2018on the job\u2019. You may have been employed, or an intern, or being mentored, or trying to develop a project of your own, or made a transition from studying a profession to practicing it.\n\nHow were you guided by others more experienced than yourself? How did you feel about the challenge? Was it challenging enough? Did anything go wrong and did you learn anything from it? What might have helped you learn more quickly? You can describe your own experience, or someone else\u2019s, or both. More stories will earn you more points!\n\nGood for you: Take this mission to reflect on what you have learned and how you grew outside of school, and feel good about yourself. It\u2019s something that\u2019s far from being easy! \u00a0\u00a0\n\nGood for everyone: Your reflection can help those that are younger to know what to expect and better prepare for their first work experience, lower or increase expectations accordingly; plus, you may just become a mentor for one of us Edgeryders!\n\n<h4>Count me in! how do I participate?</h4>\n\nIf you\u2019d like to share your insights as part of a conversation with people from all over the world, \u00a0please sign in to the platform here.

id=\"connectthedots\" name=\"connectthedots\">Connect the dots*</a></h2>\n\nOne the more difficult challenges in trying to collaborate with others around addressing a problem is finding where interests converge, or diverse. Often we know, and are a lot more interested in, shared themes and finding them can be all it takes to get a sense of \"we're in this together\". Sometimes we start initiatives knowing intuitively that they make sense, but have a hard time finding the right context where we can interact with others who also care about the issues they address...or find the right words to describe why they are contributing to solving bigger challenges. A lot of the times it is hard for others to know how to find our participate in our projects, let along back them....\n\nSo we thought it would be helpful to look at individual projects with a bit of distance, relating them to bigger issues or goals that are relevant to many people. Last year, \u00a0In the context of a post 2015 Development agenda, also known as what comes after the Millenium Goals, UNDP held a global online consultation called World We Want. They asked citizens \u201cWhat would make your future better?\u201d and engaged almost two million worldwide. A number of priority themes were identified, and we think it would be helpful to explore what our experiemces and initiatives tell us about those themes.\n\nHow to do this? 1) Pick a country and \u00a0share your thoughts around the connections between you and your work...and the different themes. How do they affect you? How do you, and what you work on affect them?\n\n<strong>Armenia focus areas</strong>:<strong>\u00a0<a href=\"#accesstowealth\">Access to wealth in a monopolistic economy</a></strong>\u00a0|\u00a0<a

If certain people want to tell certain stories as well/instead of a community video, that's great too. I thought perhaps we could all put our footage under a libre license and exchange footage at the end, so that if people want to do their own separate videos, they at least have extra footage to help illustrate their work. And they might be shooting for their own specific purpose but it could provide something of use to a general LOTE video as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Alberto], I very much like the idea of using Virtualbox - there were a couple of people using VMware at the workshop on the weekend, it seemed to work pretty well. But I did have a number of Linux gurus to help on that side - I have no experience with virtual machines and kdenlive requires various dependencies, codecs and plugins, so it is a little above my abilities. Perhaps someone more software savvy could help out?\n\nI think your video tells the story well and really gets across the spirit of the people involved. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to include some images or video of the kind of projects edgerdyers are involved in - even though the theme of the video is about the people and their interaction, a few more visual clues would help. If you don't have a chance to film anything, then this can be creative commons footage from the web, screenshots from websites, photos etc. Something which tells a curious viewer a little more about the direction edgeryders is going. It also gives you a little 'breathing room' when you need it - there are a couple of tight cuts from one person's sentence to another - having something else to cut away to for a few beats of the music allows the viewer to take in the information, and then bringing in the audio of the next speaker a few seconds before we see them could help to tie the shots together. (this is called an <a href=\"http://https://vimeo.com/videoschool/lesson/239/j-cuts-and-l-cuts\">L-cut or J-cut</a>).\n\nAlso in this case, rather than using your video editor's titling capabilities to write 'Edgeryders' it is a better idea to layer over a .png file (with transparency) of the edgeryders logo instead, which looks professional and ties it in visually with the existing website/branding.\n\nOh, one last thing - from a legal point of view, rather than writing\n\n'Frame, The Last One, CC from Free Music Archive' at the end of your video, you need to properly state the license and follow its terms. That means at the end of the video you need:\n\n'<strong>Music:\n\nThe Last One - CC-BY-NC-SA Frame</strong>'\n\nand also\n\n'<strong>Video:\n\nCC-BY-NC-SA Alberto Cottica</strong>'\n\nIn the video description on Youtube, you should include a link to the track on the FMA and also a link to the CC-BY-NC-SA license text.\n\nBut as a true free culture activist I should probably tell you to <a href=\"http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC\">use CC-BY-SA music instead</a> :)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-23 17:20:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.993735", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 576, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18055, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 4746, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>update (LEAR upgrade accunt)</b>\n\nHi,\u00a0\n\na little update from our side about platforms&amp;co.\u00a0\n\nI'm the LEAR for WeMake and my account is being upgraded.

In gaelic this means 'the one in the middle' and this is true of me in a lot of cases. I am between the many worlds without belonging solely to any one or other of them The benefit of this is that I can hear the harmonics between different communities, methodologies and paradigms. I was born to Irish parents in the heart of the Irish midlands, was 'educated' locally before leaving to the city of Galway to finish school and begin university. I took a BA in philosophy and english literature while learning bits and pieces of circus skills, druidic lore and eastern philosophy. In between studies I took time to travel around Europe and start a small circus company in Ireland. I was a very unconscious youth dealing for some time with the after effects of a chaotic upbringing.\n\nHaving graduated from university I left for circus school in the Netherlands. 8 months in I fell ill and spent the majority of the next three years between hospital and the sickbed. This experience was more educative than anything I have ever experienced in my life. I understood through these experiences a lot about a huge variety of things, the nature of life and death, the many flaws of the western health system, truths about time and perception, the many aspects of our being and how (like the EU;) they interrelate and interweave creating all of our perceived successes and failures. It became clear that treating one aspect in isolation would be a futile excercise and so after too long in hospital I decided to give up the surgery and medication and head for the East. I moved to India to find a doctor I had been told about in a town called Pushkar. I found him and after two months he had me fit and happy again and I found a determination to help people.\n\nAfter travelling India for some months I came back to Europe and after a brief period in Ireland I moved to Berlin, a Yogi I had met had told me many things about my life he had no way of knowing other than some kind of clairvoyance, he also told me that I would be thinking of a move when I returned home and he urged me to make this move, \"it will be good for you\" he said. Berlin has a youthful energy that moves and shakes according to the interactions of its people, compared with the stagnation I felt in Ireland, Berlin was the place to be. In Berlin I learned to use twitter and began following people who seemed to share in the world view I found in myself, I was amazed, here was a whole community of people conversing and sharing the many thoughts and feelings I had in isolation over the past years. I always had an inkling that ideas were impersonal and that creativity was based on exergy and the arrangement of present-state conditions. Now, reading all of these mirror-images to what I had thought were 'my' thoughts I knew that impersonality to be true.\n\nWe are EdgeRyders because we are situated on the crest of the wave of the present, we let go easily because we realize the cost of attachment, and we have faith in our position and its power to steer us out of precarious situations. Whether we consciously know it or not, the universe tends toward dissipation which is increased, as is complexity, in the evolution of order. The will we share we can often confuse as being our own, but it is a collective will born in a collective unconscious and our ability to stay connected to that rests in our faithfulness to this edge. If we want a new world to come of the crumbling of the old then we are going to have to build it from the bottom up. All the cultural and supra-cultural communities of the world passing the bricks of their experience and action to form one home to house them all.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-23 23:19:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 10:52:11.712494", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 689, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19202, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5217, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Updated the wiki</b>\n\nIndeed @melancon.

If you end up contributing more than one ticket, you can safely transfer your \u201ccompleted tasks\u201d to another participant.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Trial and error: adjusting ticket policy as we go</strong>\n\nWe are offering the first 50 tickets based on following the instructions on the event <a href=\"/t/welcome-to-lote5/4849\">minisite</a>.\n\nThe organisers reserve the right to adjust the ticket policy once the first 50 spots are taken or alternatively, in early 2016, mainly because:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>every year we experiment new formats with our event, and we don\u2019t know what works and what doesn\u2019t until we try something. Brussels is a new site for our events, and depending on how effective our outreach efforts will be, we may realise this is too expensive or too cheap for a Brussels event.</li>\n\n<li>we may need to leave a number of last minute spots open to participants whose ways of contributing fall outside the Edgeryders online infrastructure. We are aware that people are unequally digitally savvy and may prefer to get to know Edgeryders onsite before committing time to it.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>the maximum number of participants will be based on the venue capacity which at the time of launching registration (in November 2016) is not known. Should there be a higher demand than number of places, we can choose to either close the ticket distribution to fit the venue or leave it to the community to find new venues and grow the total number of participants.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFinally, LOTE5 is organised by a lot of volunteering work and much dedication by a number of community members whose efforts amount to more than tickets. We\u2019re trying to make it worthwhile your time and a lot of fun, both at the event and through the connections and community you will find there. Advice, patience and forgiveness will be much appreciated, send them over to\u00a0noemi@edgeryders.eu.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-10 13:58:53", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:28.717053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 731, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9043, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 3260, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>from @immaginoteca</b>\n\nvia francesco\u00a0 @immaginoteca\n\nknew him in 2011 through <a href=\"http://www.dreamhamar.org/category/blog/\">dreamhamar </a>project he was coordinating, through the online <a href=\"http://www.dreamhamar.org/category/tactical-urbanism/\">tactical urbanism</a> workshop .\n\nhe sent me the link of futurespotters as it includes Egypt\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-08 11:14:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.120494", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5127, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5094, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In a recent call, <a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>\u00a0and I realized we had lost the overview on the discussion about building a visualization of self-diagnosis based on Wikipedia data. This is because this discussion was held in more threads than one.\u00a0\n\nI fished out a comment that recaps most of what we know on available data and methods. I copy it below for retrievability (see\u00a0<a href=\"/t/lets-launch-making-decisions-on-the-opencare-kickoff-meeting/4980/13\">here</a> if you want to read it on context).\u00a0\n\nPage view stats are easy. Wikipedia maintains hourly dumps of all page views stats (<a href=\"https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data/Pagecounts-all-sites\">documentation</a>). Notice that IPs are\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0included in the stats.\n\nThe difficult part is disentangling the pages about care from the pages about everything else. This cannot be done directly (it is not a field of the dataset); it has to be done by association. There are two ways to do that:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>by ontology. There is a Wikiproject Medicine:\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine which even maintains its own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Stats\">statistics page</a>. It follows that there is somewhere a piece of code that knows how to tell pages which are part of this project from pages which are not (\"Medical articles are determined to be those NS0 articles tagged within the scope of WP:MED according to a category dump at the time of report generation\"). Somewhere, someone has that code and could give it to us.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>by emergence, based (you guessed it) on \u00a0the network of links connecting different entries to each other. Within Wikipedia, you can expect to see pages about medicine to cluster into a community of pages more closely connected to each other than to the rest of the encyclopedia. Something like this seems to be done by tools like WikiLoopr (try it: for example\u00a0http://www.wikiloopr.com/diabetes)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere are at least three interesting questions concerning OpenCare that you could address by looking at Wikipedia data:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Which entries are people looking up (hint: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:West.andrew.g/Popular_medical_pages\">not necessarily the ones you would think</a>)? Is that indication of self-diagnosis going on? What can we learn about that (example: are some countries more inclined to do that than other countries?). This is a non-network question.</li>\n\n<li>How does collective intelligence in Wikipedia relate pages about care to each other? How does this compare to a similar web of relationship, but derived from academic datasets? This question pertains to networks of documents (Wikipedia entries) connected by hyperlinks (<a href=\"http://chrisharrison.net/projects/clusterball/v2high/Medicinev2.jpg\">somebody did it in 2007</a>).</li>\n\n<li>How does collective intelligence proceed in building that content? This question pertains to a network of Wikipedians connected by affiliation (having edited the same page).\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThere are many <a href=\"http://infodisiac.com/Wikimedia/Visualizations/\">visualizations</a> to look up for inspiration.\u00a0\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page/it\">MediaWiki API documentation</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SoNetFBK/wiki-network\">Python code</a> to extract a social network of edits from a MediaWiki dump</li>\n\n<li>Wikisearch, a tool that computes networks of documents centered on a give article.

A veces, un producto pierde ventas por reducir precios, y al rev\u00e9s puede pasar lo mismo. Y un producto de alto valor tiene un margen mayor sobre el coste que un producto de menor valor.

Y, adem\u00e1s, intu\u00edmos que gran parte de \"lo mejor\" puede estar viviendo al filo... pero al filo del fracaso o incluso m\u00e1s all\u00e1.

The video is only one part and we'll be getting lots of nice footage anyway.\n\nAfter a few days of discussion and workshops we will have a clearer idea of the current state of Edgeryders and UnMonastery, and a better idea of what we want/need, and how to frame it, meaning we can focus the session on the process of and plan for crowdfunding rather than just debating what we are crowdfunding in the first place.\n\nSo I would propose:\n\ninitial Video Documentation discussion -Oct 29th\n\nCrowdfunding session -Nov 2nd?\n\nPost Production workshop -Nov 3rd.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-11 16:03:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.635739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 198, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29897, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4443, "post_number": 45, "raw": "<b>Many problems remain...</b>\n\n... but one is solved.

When they do, they tend to involve a limited number of credentialed experts who are already part of the establishment, and can only go so far in providing truly innovative insights. The most relevant expertise for enacting change lies in the citizenry and makes the traditional </span><a href=\"https://egov20.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/6-things-only-citizens-can-offer-to-government/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>expert role outdated</span></a><span>.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>How does one begin to tap into this expertise which, especially in the Internet era, is dispersed across many individuals and their preferred channels of expression? Part of the answer is building more agile tools to capture network intelligence and make better sense of it, tools that can scale easily to incorporate new demands. The other part is creating generative social contexts where these tools can live on, and for this to happen they should be and perceived to be open and non-exploitative by users and communities at large.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>In its current form </span><a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>under development</span></a><span> at Edgeryders, OpenEthnographer is one such innovative tool because it aggregates large numbers of first hand citizen experiences, enriching the collective knowledge (</span><span>the sum is greater than the parts</span><span>). By promoting openness of both the software itself and the end research result, it is not just useful for the client, but remains committed to the studied objects and subjects. It is, after all, a free resource which everyone can use to make sense of diverse inputs and advance collaborative work. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Through the network values underpinning its design, OpenEthnographer is intended to produce novel results. Established contributors and newcomers can interact with the stories at any point, making sense of their own and each other\u2019s input, providing more fine grained information about the contexts in which they live and work, and avoiding the risk of self referentiality. Whenever new insights become part of the conversation, it is possible to resume the research. The integrity of the conversations stem from how both Open Ethnographer and Edgeryders as its test bed environment are designed: they are open (everyone </span><span>can</span><span> participate on the subject matter) and enable participants\u2019 self selection (everyone who is willing </span><span>will</span><span> participate). Moreover, because all the content and results are freely available, everyone can become a researcher with a little training. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>In essence, like any open software tool, the OE is an equalizer, contributing to democratizing knowledge production and building legitimacy of all the actors involved. It makes it possible for anyone to double check claims about a particular group of people, while providing a flexible, ever growing conversation in which one can choose to be a contributor, a researcher or a policy maker, without skewing the results. \u00a0\u00a0</span></span>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>Outcomes, learnings and impacts so far</strong></h3>\n\n[Add here: Summary of what we have done so far and what have we learned about leveraging the power of networks in more deliberate, effective and thoughtful ways to affect change that helps poor and vulnerable people.]\n\n<span><a href=\"/en/lote4/welcome-to-lote4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Living on the Edge: The Stewardship</span></a><span> (LOTE4) was Edgeryders fourth annual community event in Matera, Italy during 26-29 October.

Three areas were identified based on the locus of projects: physical stewardship (primarily public assets like buildings, water, transport infrastructure), digital stewardship (online surveillance and data protection, the open software movement, the Internet of things), community stewardship (sharing economy, peer to peer services, unMonastery international residency hosting Lote4). The process of </span><a href=\"/t/fully-unpacking-lote4-organisation-processes-key-roles-budget-and-outcomes/3982\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>organising Lote4 </span></a><span>was in itself a meta project of community stewardship, mobilizing talent and skill in a loosely coordinated process to build a setting where people would come together and engage with each other beyond professional fields and the biases that come with those. By the time of the conference, everyone participating was equipped with expert knowledge on how taking care of common assets, digital/ physical spaces or communities can contribute to bettering lives around them.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Community members contributing on their own terms </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>One of the advantages of operating under a</span><span> </span><span>decentralized architecture is that literally any one individual can choose what to contribute and do it on their own terms. The most adventurous Edgeryders launched themselves into a so called </span><a href=\"/t/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/418\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Case Study Adventure</span></a><span> to meet their peers across the world working passionately to make a difference. The rationale was: \u201cWe want to engage projects that we think exemplify notions of Stewardship, whether they be concerned with stewarding physical, immaterial, digital assets or building new infrastructure. We\u2019d like to find the initiatives that are confronting the difficult questions head on, both newly started and those with a long history. Despite our work over the last couple of years within EdgeRyders and the unMonastery project we recognise that our perspectives are still limited by the networks we\u2019re most familiar with, we\u2019d like to take this opportunity to broaden our horizons\u201d. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>A lot of exploratory work was done in the region of Basilicata and largely across Italy, where a community member travelled to meet people doing meaningful work and ask them what stewardship meant to them. A series of video interviews posted online provided the opportunity to understand both citizen and policy makers approaches. For example, the following makes for a more legitimate argument when made by someone in the Italian ministry of finance: \"Community stewardship is a reaction to a double failure. The failure of the state to provide services tailored to places; and the failure of the private sector when privatization became the new game in town, but turned out to be ineffective and unjust\" (</span><a href=\"/en/lote4/interview-with-fabrizio-barca?lang=en\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>F. Barca)</span></a></span>\n\n<span><span>These efforts were entirely voluntary, and it made sense that the broader community would back them up with outreach support, helping host events in cities like Berlin, Athens, Amsterdam, Stockholm, or London. The others were happy to exchange notes when documentation was posted online, as per a strong agreement and long time nurtured practice in Edgeryders (see below).</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Mixing the online channels with field work, and many to many conversations with more private meetups turned out to be very successful in terms of approaching a topic from various angles. As someone noticed, \u201cif you're asking the right questions with just one or two people it can still be hugely productive - perhaps more so than a big group speaking together.\u201d</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Making global knowledge relevant locally, and viceversa</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Almost all of the projects mentioned before and during The Stewardship live deeply in local contexts. An international event and global storytelling culture slightly remove them from those contexts in order to emphasize relevance, but only to examine them closer when people come together in a room. In one of Lote plenaries focusing on learning from the Case Study Adventure, it became clear that acting as stewards in highly regulated environments requires self sacrifice and sometimes even transgressing rules (eg: occupying or repurposing public spaces to meet community needs). Some countries are more sensitive to this than others, depending on legislation or simply degree of conservativeness in those cultures etc. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Another example is the unMonastery, a project birthed internationally whose work was focused on local challenges. Bringing to Matera the world's first </span><a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>unMonastery</span></a><span> and an event like LOTE4 in its aftermath put the city on the map of many of the continent's hackers, activists and radical social innovators. unMonastery has a high international visibility, both on big media (from The Guardian to The Nation) and on the alternative circuits (</span><a href=\"http://www.baumhausberlin.de/events/emergent-berlin/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Emergent Berlin,</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality-2014-visibility-is-a-trap\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Improving Reality.</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.transmediale.de/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Transmediale,</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/22717/1/the-unmonastery-a-commune-for-the-internet-age\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Dazed</span></a><span>...); above all, it supplied a sandbox for the local community to learn how to interact with global innovators.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Building collaboration </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Coming from a natively European environment, Edgeryders (the organisation is a spin off from a Council of Europe - European Commission project) has a history of interacting with policy makers and interfacing between formal structures and citizens at the edge. We think some of the most relevant and impactful work can happen at the intersection of these two, and this is why we insisted on having a former member of the European Parliament as an event curator and willing to offer advice:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>\u201cI tried to make my experiences of the European Parliament useful for other visitors at \\#LOTE4 by encouraging more interaction with political institutions. Especially in a community which so often restricts its interaction with policy to interaction with governments and civil servants, my hope is that some people now feel more encouraged to speak with directly elected individuals.\u201c </span><a href=\"/t/stewardship-and-policy-lote4-post-reflection/3837\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>(A. Andersdotter</span></a><span>) </span></span>\n\n<span><span>This aspect is also at the core of our collaboration with Matera - learning how to activate and involve the citizenry, and give them space once they got involved. Community members and former unMonastery residents have recently entered an open data contest held by the municipality of Matera, </span><a href=\"/t/hacking-public-transport-matera-and-beyond/3984\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>winning</span></a><span> two out of the four prizes with an open app mapping the public transport infrastructure. Instead of taking the prize and walk away, they are now re-investing it in another collaborative event where they can continue developing the project, all in an attempt to leave something behind that the local community will benefit from.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The topic of stewardship and what Edgeryders are learning collectively is paving the </span><a href=\"/t/life-after-lote4-were-dreaming-of-new-unmonasteries-more-harmonious-hackathons/3962\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>way forward</span></a><span> in terms of where this grassroots community decides to put its skills and energy in 2015. As part of a social contract that empowers the doers, it is up to individual members to step forward and take ideas wherever they see fit. We expect new event formats this year, where starting from specific knowledge we can focus on building actual prototypes. \u00a0</span></span>\n\n<strong>A few numbers</strong>\n\n[Add here: some numbers indicating effectiveness of our way of going about network engagement, the knowledge built and how it's finding its way to others. If we can get an idea about the number of new relationship/collaborations/activities that it seems to have inspired that would be good too. Maybe also a few individual quotes from participants re: value (if any) coming out of having engaged in the process for them personally.]\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\n\n<table style=\"border:none;border-collapse:collapse;width:624px\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr style=\"height:0px\">\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>Network engagement metric*</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>What does it mean?</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>How is this important?

The latter acts as a seed for ongoing conversations and inspires even more people to join the conversation. In building The Stewardship, the engagement efforts were shouldered by the community at large and in completely voluntary fashion. This is only feasible is everyone does it, as it lowers the individual cost of participation. For future efforts, the recommendation is that more resources are found to support the considerable large effort of producing knowledge at these parameters (global, distributed, grassroots). \u00a0\u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>The Edgeryders online platform has all content licensed under </span><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</span></a><span>., which makes it ok for anyone, including third parties, to run analyses on it or summarize content. Despite this, not all users fully understand it in practice. Open Ethnographer is one such case, where community members had contributed content before the project was announced and in one particular case, decided they do not want it as part of the research body.

Georgiadis has been involved with his company \"We Deliver Taste\" (http://wedelivertaste.com) in consulting the place, crafting the menu, making it local, affordable, Mediterranean. Their consultancy for food businesses connects small producers from all over Greece, trying to change the hospitality landscape in the country. Part of the idea is to tell people about the ingredients, the element of storytelling, which changes customers' relations to the product, and the gastro-landscape of the country.\n\nPavlos is an ethnobotanist and for 12 years he devoted his career to science, researching for his Ph.D. in Thailand and China. He left this path four years ago to invest time and energy in agrifood and environment - the brainchild of this transition is We Deliver Taste, a company that investigates the food system, from seed to stomach, in which he was joined by two Italians and a Czech. They are not only interested in the processes that bring the food to our tables, but also in the cultures surrounding it, especially the Mediterranean dining customs and love for good food. In one of the side projects, funded by Horizon 2020, they're also concentrating on reforming the digital aspect of the food business by\u00a0preparing pilot, open data systems, tools and applications that will make the path from the farmer to the customer/industry (hospitals, hotels) more clear, while at the same time keeping people informed and educated about the content of their plate.\u00a0\n\nBy this multilayered, multifaceted enterprise Pavlos wants to change the paradigm. He believes that if the way we think about the time and space of food, meaning the time spent on preparation, growth, the human experience of food, it will have an impact on climate resilience, climate justice, biodiversity, water and soil conservation and will boost regenerative economies in rural areas.\u00a0\n\nPavlos targets people in their 50-ties and 60-ties, those who have access to power and money, and believes that educating and informing them is crucial to driving the change. He consciously chose to become part of the market, be open for collaboration with government, and get involved with huge public procurement systems because he thinks demonizing the market is wrong. And\u00a0because there is a dire need for change there. After years of scaling and working for their position, We Deliver Taste are\u00a0now in serious talks with important actors.\u00a0\n\nOn a smaller scale, there is an idea of creating an edible dish which could be used in the refugee camps. It's not that the idea is brand new, there are some Indian startups that have crowdfunded and done it already - but it's that importing such a product would be counterproductive. Instead, Pavlos\u00a0wants to recreate the whole system necessary for producing such a dish - an industrial designer who'd made the moulds, a baker, ideally struggling to survive in the market, a flour producer, etc.\u00a0\n\nHe also dreams of a website that would accompany this project. One could see there how much profit it created for the parties involved, work saved on waste management and how many refugees it catered. Besides,\u00a0he wants to create a crowdfunding campaign to donate money to biodegradable plastic producers in Italy, who'd, later on, provide their product to the refugee camps in Greece. The stake is huge - 60.000 refugees, 2 meals a day, which makes a 100.000 dishes a day, and it will happen for years as maybe even a half of them\u00a0will stay in Greece for longer. That would fix the existing problem of waste and even produce compost in large communal digestors to feed the organic agriculture and parks.\u00a0\n\n\"We have to enter this market fast and with confidence right now. There is not much time for discussions - it's somehow already too late\".\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe second part of the discussion coming briefly.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-01 12:20:54", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:18:32.168924", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 726, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 110.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25393, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3884, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>How's it coming along?</b>\n\nHi <a href=\"/u/ireinga\">@ireinga</a>, hope you are well and your project is moving forward.\n\nIn case you missed it, I just wanted to point out that <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographers-initial-release/4073\">Open Ethnographer is now live</a>, and if you want to test it or start using it we are happy to show you around.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-10 13:28:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.341682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 76, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25078], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15952, "user_id": 3520, "topic_id": 6166, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Agreed on organization + Further evaluation on timing</b>\n\nNoemi, @Rossana_Torri and I have discussed your proposal also with CoM officers and it makes a lot of sense to split the event into A and B.

Matthias sees it like this:\n\n<em>Edgeryders channels the emergent response to the impending crisis. It takes a form that we call Open Village: a set of documented tools, norms and templates for small-scale, semi-independent societies. I have in mind Nepalese villages, and how dramatically better life there could get if we deployed some of appropriate tech (think blimp cargo drones) and some appropriate economics (think network barter).\u00a0But open villages do not need to be actual villages, they could also be city blocks, for example. The Reef is one of the labs where we invent and test new ways to live in an open village.</em>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Inventing ways to live (and the artifacts to it with)</h3>\n\nThe Reef will be more interesting if it is not afraid to rething and re-invent everyday life. This will probably translate into its own aesthetics. For example, you could do a lot of furnishing using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container\">Euroboxes</a>. They stack precisely on\u00a0Europallets, which means The Reef is easy and cheap to reconfigure or even move from one location to another. The underlying concept is similar to open source software projects: developer build a\u00a0applications which can be proprietary or bespoke, but almost always they use open source components like libraries and standards. Similarly, The Reef can be low-lovel standardised, so that it is easier to copy, fork and expand.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Economics</h3>\n\nWe ran some back-of-the-envelope numbers on two realistic scenarios: the current pre-Reef space in Rue Pierre Decoster (200 square meters, 4 bedrooms, in Forest. Estimated rent: 2.4K per month including building charges and expenses) and FOAM, on the Canal and close to Sainte-Catherine (600 square meters, hypothesis of 5 bedrooms. Estimated rent: 3.3K per month including building charges).\n\nOur goals were: affordable, high quality communal housing; pleasant office space at good value-for-money for the ER company; possibility of using the office for extra networking and relationship building (co-working, small events); one extra room available to ER for residencies (to be rented out on Airbnb when not in use either for ER or as a guest room).\n\nOut method was to allocate 700-1K EUR per month to the company;\u00a0charge about 450-550 EUR for a single room (including charges; so about 4-500); charge slightly less than double that for a larger double room (700-850). If it adds up, it is sustainable. We would have a minimum of three Edgeryders permanent residents (Nadia, Noemi and Alberto) occupying three rooms. Ideally we would have one more, or one couple. This would be probably a possible next hire, since the two remaining partners do not seem inclined to move to Brussels. One room is needed as a spare (guest toom, residencies etc.).

It is a space that sort of extends your juvenility - following those who thinker, improve on, and manifest endless curiosity and passion for knowledge has this incredible effect. It also preserves the naive, since one preserves the optimism of those who try not to give up and keep on imagining, designing, and building the better future in one way or another.\u00a0\n\nYouth Global Forum, like other events dedicated to creating a platform for these relentless types, sparks exactly the same feeling of excitement and empowerment. The organisation Youth Tim,\u00a0which has organised similar meetings for 7 years now in Europe, for the first time invited dozens of changemakers to meet outside of it. The idea was brilliant, as we ended up exploring the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, a place of incredible potential and quite visibly heading towards technological growth and sophistication. Indonesia is a place where high quality, cheap 4g is ubiquitous and its main cities have clean, fast Japanese trains and incredible high rises. At the same time just from a very superficial investigation one can see how it struggles with cleanness, traffic, air pollution, poverty and poor living conditions. Writing these words, i sit in a packed minibus to a mountainous village not far from Bogor, yet the views outside are precarious.\u00a0\n\nThe forum is one of two annual events that cater the growing talents. They organise a summer school, where youngsters equip themselves with knowledge and skills for their future social businesses, and it happens every year in a new location (the upcoming one in Austria), and then there is a forum - an offline platform with funding opportunities. During the forum youth meets with experts and networks, and those with projects have a chance to pitch their ideas to a group of panelists, get their feedback, and based on a popular vote - win grants to make their plans come true, or fast forward the implementation. The budgets varied drastically - from 30.000 euros to 700. Everyone had an equal shot here. There are also a couple of scholarships to business schools in Barcelona, Zagreb and Jakarta awarded to the finalists.\u00a0\n\nMy focus was on female entrepreneurs who took part in the competition or came to the forum. I ended up including also projects led by men. So what do these changemakers do?\u00a0\n\nOlga is an illuminating person - before she went off to become the winner of the competition, we spent a lot of time discussing everything from war in Ukraine to our love for Indian food. Her project came about as a result of observation and personal experiences - she felt disconnected from her own grandparents, and so did many of her friends. But a few years ago she met her German teacher, now 86, who became a surrogate of an emotionally connected grandmother to her. This is when she started thinking of opening a place that would connect young people from disenfrenchised families primarly with lonely elderly who need affection and seek for things to do. After trying out different ways to make it happen, including an obviosuly rigged state organised comoetition which she won not to ever see the money, she went on with her life and started working for a marketing agency, until the youth forum idea came up and it made sense to give it a try again.\u00a0\n\nOlga talks passionatelly about Russia and problems of uniformity, high expectations about the youth (especially women, who have to be stunning physically and make great careers), isolation and alientation of the eldrely and lack of strong social bonds. She says that the trust and warmth that used to be a Russian characteristic vanished with the transfirmation and it gets worse. People don\u2019t smile, the family values fall far behind everything else, and very few peope have means, courage and energy to fight with the system. Olga already tried once running a social project and after teo years she was exhausted and empty.\n\nFrom old to young is an idea that resonates very well with what my network does - bridging idle resources with needs, especially in cases when there is so much potential for exchange: lonely, still fit and not too old people want to remain active, while many of these youngsters whose parents could not afford extra curricular activities or just cannot give the emotional support to their kids. We have a match here - and there is a vast range of ways in which these two groups will interact. Olga with her 6000 euros of grant from the Youth Time International Movement will now start scouting for space, equipment and start building in offline platform in Moscow. Let\u2019s see where it takes her. I keep my fingers crossed for her project, as it addresses issues that are increasingly pressing in the modern world, yet the governments mostly seem to busy to engage in imagining alternative modes of dealing with aging, or with underprivledged youth. It might start as simple as it is, by inviting elderly to hang out with the kids, and it might organically grow into a model case. Time will tell.\u00a0\n\nNext profile: meet Sri, a young Indonesian researcher who came up with an idea for an organic fertilizer.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-09 08:05:21", "updated_at": "2018-01-11 13:42:09.487846", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 940, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 80.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10484, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 6122, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Sober, to-the-point and concise.

I don't think people would have watched a 1.5 hour interview. I perhaps should have been more strict and just asked the questions, and posted unedited videos which would have taken much less time. I feel the editing and transcribing was important to make the material accessible and the long interviews enabled me to dig deeper into the concept/philosophy of stewardship rather than merely report back on the project structure and implementation. A few posts were based on people answering questions via email so those posts took very little time.\n\nThe Ruddymoor Allotment video is one end of the spectrum with several interviews - lots of b-roll and 2 visits to the place which I estimate came in at about 15 hours of work. The other end is Art and the Commons which I just posted answers as they were written to me in an email, which I estimated was 30 minutes work in total as it took several emails and reminders to get answers and pictures together.\n\nTime estimates do not include travel time so in some cases I spent 2 hours or so on a bus getting to and from the interviews.The costs I incurred were mostly for travel-- which would be my flight to Newcastle from Rome- bus and train to Newcastle and Scotland from Crook( little town where I was based near Durham.) I was staying with friends so housing was free but it should be a consideration for any budget.\n\nI agree with Lauren that in order to do a successful series of case studies it is important to have enough time in the area, probably 2 weeks, and at least one strong contact on the ground to make the initial connections. I hope this is the information is helpful as we move forward.\n\nIt is also important to think about how we describe what will happen to the information we collect. The people I interviewed were open to speaking with me about stewardship for the purposes of elevating the level of conversation at the conference but I am not sure if this would change if they were informed about using the posts on the platform as data, or if I was a paid researcher rather than a volunteer as it begins to make their participation more of a commodity.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n\n<div class=\"ajR\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\" id=\":18g\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\"></div>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2014-10-30 13:42:00", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 09:59:31.598643", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 537, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24930, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5785, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Super useful feedback.  </b>\n\nComing from a comms expert it means a lot!

The role of Edgeryders in it was to convene a large-scale\u00a0online conversation on community-delivered care services. In the proposal, we defined\u00a0\"large-scale\": users in the low hundreds, contributions in the low thousands.\u00a0\n\nIt is going well.\u00a0You can always do better, sure, but we can be proud of our results. As I write this, we already achieved our quantitative goal, one year ahead of schedule. At the time of writing, the opencare conversation consists of 318\u00a0posts (mostly long-form), with 1,365\u00a0comments, authored by 199 users. It adds up to over 350,000 words, almost all in English.\u00a0Its diversity is impressive: people chip in from all over the world, and native speakers of English are a minority.\u00a0\n\nWhat I like best is the quality of the stories that people are sharing around. They are stories of practical knowledge and lived-out experiences, of ingenuity and struggle. The need to care for one's loved ones is a great motivator. To do justice to such quality, we built a <a href=\"/t/hacking-health-in-bordeaux-episode-1-a-first-peek-at-the-semantic-social-graph/5939\">cutting edge methodology</a>, based on ethnography and network science, to summarize a large-scale conversation.\u00a0\n\nIt comes down to this: Edgeryders is good at building smart, generous,\u00a0online communities. Part of this is a long experience. Another part is that we\u00a0do our best not to be exploitative of participants. We did it at all scales, from town to planet,\u00a0and in many different contexts. We love doing it, because of the incredible people that we get to meet. \u00a0But it's hard: we are one of few organizations that can do it reliably. \"If we build it, they will come\" no longer works.\n\nSo, here's the deal. The European Commission's DG CNECT is posting opportunities for funded research projects and/or contracts that involve online consultations. Two examples are\u00a0<a href=\"https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=1793.\">this</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-leit-ict_en.pdf#page=101\">this</a>\u00a0(letter b). I\u00a0suppose other organizations, too, will have the same needs. We would like to take part\u00a0in high-quality proposals. This means joining a partnership; one of our roles on the partnership would be that of leading in the online consultation itself. My guess is that this is an especially difficult box to tick. I am confident we can tick it, if anyone can.\n\nIf you are interested, get in touch: alberto [at] edgeryders [dot] eu.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-31 09:38:56", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 11:47:44.954245", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 3325], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21296, "user_id": 514, "topic_id": 4158, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>A1. There is lack of cooperation between different people ... </b>\n\nTo the first approximation, we can say that this is always the case. But in reality the level of coordination changes with circumstances over time. We can't speak in general because we are talking about a vast development site. But I can mention something about my domain, the narrow area in which I am most active, which might give you an idea about the dynamics in other areas. \u00a0\n\nIn commons-based peer production we are transitioning from a network/community development phase to a network of networks phase. Until now, different groups were formed to experiment with peer production. The focus was at the group level. Some exchange and crosspollination happened through social media, but\u00a0most of the activity was enclosed within these networks/communities. This is very normal during the phase of emergence, where there is a proliferation of models, people try different things, there is no recipe, no blueprint, it's trial and error, mostly error and learning... This was the time when we built fablabs, makerspaces, co-working spaces, local agriculture, open source hardware communities, DIY communities, etc.\u00a0\n\nWe are not out of this phase of emergence. We can't say that we now have a few stable models. But in parallel with this development I am observing something new. These networks/communities are realizing that in order to\u00a0increase\u00a0their economic\u00a0strength, in order to\u00a0become resilient, they need to interface more strongly with each other. A new economy is precipitating, different and complementary peer production networks/communities are coming together into an ecosystem. The attention starts to shift to the network of networks level. With this movement we see the need for collaboration at the infrastructure level, in order to make these networks interoperable at the network of networks level. So there is an intensification in collaboration and coordination among different groups involved in infrastructure development.\u00a0\n\n\u200bMore\u00a0concretely, we have SENSORICA, Valeureux/Wezer, Enspiral and others sharing mailing lists and meeting and\u00a0coordinating\u00a0their work. This is real.\n\nNOTE: I am using the network/community dual concept because there are two schools of thought that don't always agree. Some peer production projects are set up as communities, which are heavier on culture, identity, rituals, sense of belonging, etc. Others are set up as loosely affiliated networks with less pressure to conform or identify with something. I think that there is a need for both, in different contexts. For example, open source hardware development happens within loosely affiliated networks. Local agriculture initiatives tend to be more community oriented. A fablab is also seen and run as a community. These two peer production settings are very different, require different tools, different governance, etc. But people don't always make the distinction and often call online open source hardware projects, communities.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-04 08:26:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.428548", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 498, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12667, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3781, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>hmm</b>\n\nI didn't know.

I doubt we will be able to collect new data points\u00a0just for the purpose of this paper.\n\nI'm lacking expertise on how to superimpose a typology for conversations - in the\u00a0first steps you mention. I will leave this to you and Federico to lead.. and I could try to support it by detailing my observations on the actions emerging as we speak (Point 1).\u00a0\n\n<em>Ezio: My question is: I imagine you mean examples of \u201cactions\u201d that happened/are happening thanks to the existence of Opencare: correct?\u00a0 How many of these actions do we have until now? (what Pop-up villages are?).</em> Correct! I don't know how many actions we have because I don't know what constitutes action - clearly the strongest is OpenandChange, the collective application. The Pop Up Care Village is a concept for the opencare final project event and many conversations these months will be encouraging community members and openandchange partners to co-create it, so this is something we can expect to grow.\u00a0I will give you more examples on ongoing community collaborations:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tBelgian traumatologist goes on a tour in refugee camps in Greece to offer free treatment to anyone who needs them.</li>\n\n<li>\tBritish volunteer in refugee camps takes on artistic residency at an Armenian cultural center, as facilitated by another opencare member in Armenia.</li>\n\n<li>\tCommunity members at a bioengineering lab in Ghent, Belgium connect with OpenInsulin to share the work of developing an open source method for producing proinsulin.</li>\n\n<li>\tAmerican intentional community with a health care program offers to host the developer of a peer-to-peer emergency response service.</li>\n\n<li>Italian community member considers setting up an opencare spinoff.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere might be more,\u00a0I would need to look deeper. What do you think? We have more or less detailed threads for each. But anyhow they are early in their lives, many might not lead to concrete collective actions. Which is why typologies might not make a whole lot of sense. What does make more sense, in my opinion,\u00a0is looking at their quality.\n\nWhich brings me to Objective 2) - why this is collaborative culture and how it manifests itself:\u00a0\u00a0I imagined we would rely on ethnographic codes\u00a0to describe in detail the participants and how those conversations unfold. The data we have about specific projects\u00a0shows collaborative culture is (to some extent, or we can hypothhesize this) ingrained in the participants values or worldviews\u00a0- even before they engage in opencare, someone solving a health problem in\u00a0community already has some experience of collaboration, connecting with others. So self-selection to participate in a project that is about sharing and collaboration is part of what makes possible action. Also, shared interests is another - we see this in the network of\u00a0<a href=\"http://164.132.58.138:9000/#/dashboard/tagView\">co-occurences</a>, how new meanings are discovered together, much more so than individually. This can go on, but I have a feeling it's too early.\n\nMy point is: keep in mind that we have more data on the conditions\u00a0for collaboration and creating opportunities than about the actual life of the collaborations (with the exception of openandchange!).\u00a0\n\nIn short, yes to the structure, in so far as we keep certain flexibility with regard to points 1-4?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-09 11:41:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.417986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 667, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31636], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23479, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 3697, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>@natalia</b>\n\ndo what ramona says\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-26 19:30:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.360987", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25830, "user_id": 1818, "topic_id": 2434, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Some clarifying info</b>\n\nDear Lucas -\n\nIndeed, under current circumstances this is not a project to be \"enthusiastic\" over. I am, however, very inspired that my sisters at Life in Africa have come up with a plan that seems to fall within the realm of what feels possible to them.\u00a0<span>I've seen Peter's response to your questions but worry that the numbers-related questions you posed remain fuzzy. I hope the following context will help to make things clearer.</span>\n\n<span>Approximately 1.2 million Acholi people were displaced by the Kony war, which meant that the entire rural population of Northern Uganda was cleared from the land and put into IDP camps for 15-20 years. About 5 years ago, the government began closing the camps (in some cases rather abruptly, with unannounced bulldozers), leaving families to return \"home\" with very little in the way of assistance in finding their ancestral land, rebuilding their homes, or clearing the land to plant food. Approximately 5,000 families made their way to the capital, where they were invited by the local tribal king to take refuge on Kireka hill, near the rock quarry. Over 2+ decades, this evolved into the peri-urban slum that is now called the Acholi Quarter. </span>\n\nThere are many organizations working to help families in the Acholi Quarter, especially with income generation opportunities and health issues. Life in Africa is a community based organization there, with/run by 30-35 women who love and trust each other, and who have been convening at least weekly for the past several years to support each other in their daily lives and to prepare together for going home. They have learned many skills together which they feel can be useful in restarting their lives at home, however, raising enough money to do so, and figuring out how to make things work logistically are challenges that every family faces. \u00a0 First and foremost, this plan they have been developing is designed to help navigate the logistical challenges inherent in managing their family's ongoing lives in Kampala (earning income, keeping children in school, etc), while simultaneously getting enough food and lodging prepared 400+km away to be able to move their families home to. At the $1-2 per day that they earn in the quarry, it is difficult to save much (though they have been saving) and moving their families into the wilderness to camp for 6 months or more just isn't a viable option.\u00a0\n\nThe majority of these 30+ women have land available to them through their husbands' families upon which to build new homes and plant food to sell or sustain on, but in most cases there is <em>nothing</em> there now. Before they can move their families they need to begin with clearing, building and planting food - all of this takes time, effort and money. The Family Transition Center would initially offer them a free place to sleep and eat while they work as a team to prepare the minimum that each of their families will need to survive. Unfortunately, none can afford to go for very long without also earning income to feed their families back in Kampala. The 60 trips estimated indeed refers to 2 trips each for the 30 women, which will help them to each schedule blocks of their time for this teamwork between July when the next planting season begins, and December when the current school term will end. During this start-up phase this scheduling will be arranged to provide a constant presence at the new Center, with teams of women overlapping and traveling out by day from there (30 min - 1 hour from the Center) to the 22 nearby family homesteads to work.\u00a0\n\n<div>Some of the women (especially the single, divorced and widowed mothers in the group) do not have land available for them to go home to. They would ideally like to resettle near each other, on land at or near the Family Transition Center. \u00a0Based on a recent phone call I had with Grace, I would assume that the 8-12 families Peter mentioned is that minority who will stay there more or less permanently. Given that number (which has emerged as a new factor now that \"the plan\" is closer to becoming real) Grace also suggests that they plan to buy an additional 2 acres with the Center start-up budget we raise.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>The specific land has not yet been identified, but land is readily available in the region as people are cash poor and willing to downsize some of the larger farms that existed before the war. I love the <a href=\"http://resiliencemaps.org\">ResilienceMaps.org</a>\u00a0resource you've pointed to, and would love for Grace to understand how she can use that as a tool for selecting the land to invest in, from what I assume will be a number of choices. The way things work, however, no decision can really be made on land until the money is in hand. With cash available, however, things can move very quickly. \u00a0My understanding is that the ladies would like to look in the area outside of Kitgum town, as the schools there tend to be better than elsewhere, and basic infrastructure like roads and water points would be more readily available. Electricity is unlikely to be there without significant investment. Cellphone coverage is spotty, and could play a role in deciding on the final location. Connectivity most often routes through the cellphone coverage in Uganda these days (and is almost always quite slow)</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>With regard to starting a piggery, there is at least one member who has been successfully breeding and raising pigs for the past several years, so that knowhow exists within the community.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>With regard to agriculture, Peter forgot to mention that our mutual friend <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/biplab-paul\">Biplab Paul</a> has already committed to joining in this effort, as part of his current drive to globalize an innovative irrigation technique he's been using with farmers in arid regions of India. There is unfortunately very little local knowledge about permaculture principles, but an avid desire and need to rebuild a local agricultural knowledge base.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Peter and Grace are currently reaching out to Life in Africa's allies around the world with the news that we're moving ahead with this and an invitation to become involved, so we will see in the coming days what else emerges.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>This is all I have time for just now.

We called them ecotopia and had them in Germany (1989), Hungary (1990), Estonia (1991) and Bulgaria (1992) during my time there (EYFA continued and had the last ecotopia 2008 in Turkey. Actually some former ecotopians picked up the idea again and organised the last ecotopia for now in Germany in 2010. I did the website, internet cafe and helped in the kitchen). I worked from 1990-92 in the international co-ordination office helping to prepare those and other activities.

We also gave English classes in the secondary school, where we used \"Email as a tool for re-conciliation\" which became ZaMir Pakrac. I was working in the office, teaching email, running ZaMir Pakrac and eventually found myself as member of the project management.\n\nBelziger Forum: founded in 1998 to fight right extremism and violence in Belzig. Basic focus is to run the \"Infocafe 'Der Winkel'\" as a save meeting place for migrants, esp. refugees, and locals. We offer coffee, tea, internet-access and wireless LAN to prices affordable for refugees. We also do inter-cultural projects in schools, refugee camps and alike. My main job is to do a <a href=\"http://www.aussenlager-roederhof.de\">website on a former outpost of a concentration camp in Belzig</a> as part of memorial, I also make photos of our projects, maintain the PC's, do some fund-raising and the <a href=\"http://www.dewinkel.de\">website of the cafe</a>.\n\nThe links might give you a better picture of the projects.\n\nWhat I am good at: hard for me to tell, but I heard that I am good at teaching computer skills.\n\nWhat I would like to do with edgeryders: I believe I am able to help with contacts and eventually I might have an idea for one or the other project.\n\nWriting all this, I realize that I spent too much time behind computer screens....\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-22 14:13:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.312598", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20360], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1016, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 983, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div><span>Hallo,</span></div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div><span>Mag ik je storen met een niet-alledaagse vraag?</span></div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div><span>Edgeryders is een groep activisten en denkers vanuit heel Europa die vorig jaar in juni voor de eerste keer samen zijn gekomen.

As you picked up on I think my working practice shares many of the common values of EdgeRyders and is similar in its patterns or rythmn.\u00a0\n\nCase in point, I'm currently subletting my room in London, staying with family in Prague, whilst I do two things, the first is to rejuvenate my bank balance through freelance webdesign sourced within my personal network. The second thing i'm focused on is producing a book for an exhibition in London, the book functions as an art work; the funds I make here will be used to produce the work, which has no hope of financial renumeration. And so the cycle continues.\u00a0\n\nThe point Alberto makes about autonomy; the fox and the chicken. Is one i've come to recognise within my own network and within my own work only recently - this is seriously unsustainable. Add to the mix that I recently turned down a high status, full time job (essentially because I wasn't prepared to build what they wanted because I felt it was misguided) - \u00a0this has provoked the question though: What now?\u00a0\n\nI'm not sure a highly distributed career path, living hand to mouth is the best option for attaining autonomy, particularly in a world that appears to be getting poorer.\n\nMyself and peers are under no allusion about the impact a contracting economy is likely to have on our daily lives, in London at least I sense a stark correlation between this and a contraction in imagination which by proxy is reducing optimism for the future. But how can the transparency of this situation begin to aid policy makers? Or even begin to address your question on how we draw conclusions 1. and 2. closer together?\u00a0\n\nFor me, in a moment of transition I recognise the need for compromise, inorder to break the deadlock - my route up until now has been radically outside the mainstream, however for me the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations\">diffusion of innovation\u00a0</a>has held true and much of the work I've been involved in is beginning to occupy a Mainstream space. Therefore I'd ask what casestudies exist in the 'career history' of other EdgeRyders that illustrate a transition for a culture, practice or thing to something a Mainstream audience can assert value in? \u00a0\n\nProjects like the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/few-us-living-together-somewhere-and-changing-things-unmonastery\">UnMonastary</a> i think go some way to elucidating this further, I think actually it is for us to devise the metrics by which this value can be read and translated. In an ideal world the policy implementation would be to give us space to use on our own terms and trust our intentions - so pretty unrealistic.\u00a0\n\nBut to return to the innovation point and for the sake of argument, lets say EdgeRyders are squarely in the 'innovator' bracket, should the focus then be that as precarity increases, the ability to incubate new innovative ideas is decreased - which is bad for everyone because our propensity to solve problems dissolves. So why do people 'innovate'? I think we can safely say that it's not to retain the status quo, it's probably to change things, do the jobs currently available offer the opportunity to change things? In most instances, no.\n\nSo in policy terms what can we derive from this? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxLXfRAcbP8\">That google have got it right? </a>\u00a0I'm not sure this is the right outcome but I know a greater number of individuals would take job security over precarity if that were ensured a reduction in the working week and recognition that not all work should be made accountable.\n\nHopefully this helps, if you'd like to narrow the question, I'm happy to continue the conversation and hopefully this reply wasn't to freewheeling!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-15 16:11:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.955451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 710, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9500, "user_id": 2554, "topic_id": 4490, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>by the way \"ahile nagare kahile?\"</b>\n\nmeans \"If not now, when?\" And I think it is followed by \"If not us, then who?\" - I find this saying such a compelling one.

Chiar daca comunitatile si sistemele de tip network au fost niste subiecte recurente in curriculumul scolar pe toata durata facultatii, experienta acestui internship la Artconnect Berlin mi-a oferit o perspectiva mai clara si mai practica asupra diferitelor procese din viata reala, in sensul ca am putut vedea cum, oferind o platforma unde oamenii se pot intalni si cunoaste unul pe celalalt, se pot forma comunitati puternice care sa conduca la schimbare. </span>\n\n<span>Anul viitor va fi ultimul meu an de facultate, in care am optat catre o specializare in industrii creative, pentru ca mi se pare un domeniu foarte interesant si provocator, care se leaga foarte bine cu personalitatea mea, deoarece am fost dintotdeauna o persoana foarte creativa si perspicace, dar foarte structurata si analitica in acelasi timp. Specializarea aceasta va fi bazata pe modurile in care industriile creative pot actiona ca vectori de schimbare pentru inovatie sociala. Dupa specializare imi voi scrie teza de licenta (unde una dintre temele posibile este chiar participarea Bucurestiului in cursa pentru capitala culturala europeana in 2021), iar apoi as vrea sa mai lucrez timp de un an sau doi ca sa castig mai multa experienta profesionala, dupa care as vrea sa ma intorc in Bucuresti si sa incerc sa aduc toate cunostintele pe care le-am dobandit in strainatate si entuziasmul meu inapoi acolo. </span>\n\n<span>Cred foarte mult in crearea de platforme sociale unde indivizii pot gasi sprijin si idei similare spre a co-crea si a face posibile obiective comune. Cred ca, cu ajutorul unei comunitati puternice, ideile bune pot gasi mai mult suport si expunere pentru a putea fi puse in aplicare si pentru a dezvolta societatea viitorului. Cu toate acestea, bazandu-ma pe experienta internshipului meu, cred ca cea mai mare provocare in domeniul crearii unei comunitati online este de a le ajuta sa devina independente. Altfel spus, de a ajunge in punctul in care utilizatorii folosesc platforma ca un mediu care vine in ajutorul idelor lor si care ii ajuta sa se dezvolte, fara a mai necesita stimuli externi. </span>\n\n<span>Mi-ar placea sa continui sa lucrez cu comunitati de acest fel ca sa invat mai multe despre metode de stimulare a caracterului independent in retele, dar si ca sa incerc sa ajut idei in care cred sa creasca. De asemenea, mi-as dori foarte mult sa raman conectata cu Bucuresti, deoarece obiectivul meu a fost dintotdeauna sa imi termin studiile si sa ma intorc sa contribui la transformarea acestui oras intr-un loc destept si inovator. </span>\n\n<span>Pe langa obiectivele profesionale, sunt foarte pasionata in timpul liber de tehnologie de varf si de felul in care afecteaza societatea in care traim. Sunt un utilizator avid de social media si folosesc mediul online pentru a aduna diverse informatii din diferite medii, dar si pentru a provoca discutii vis-a-vis de diferite domenii de interes personal. In medie, folosesc de la 1 pana la 5 ore pe zi pentru a citi diverse articole sau forumuri, ceea ce inseamna ca intru in contact cu foarte mult continut in fiecare zi, pe care il folosesc pentru a lansa discutii sau pentru a ma dezvolta personal. Sunt o persoana foarte deschisa, si imi place sa cunosc si sa interactionez cu multe tipuri de oameni cu diverse interese si domenii de activitate. </span>\n\n<span>Acestea fiind spuse, am gasit acest anunt prin recomandarea unui prieten, in timp ce cautam un job pentru la vara. Luand in considerare tot ce am mentionat mai sus, cred ca este o oprtunitate ideala pentru mine ca sa invat tot ce mi-am propus si chiar mai mult, deoarece mi-as dori sa ma implic de asemenea in organizarea unui eveniment pentru a experimenta cu acest domeniu de activitate. Sunt extrem de interesata de tot conceptul din spatele EdgeRyders si sunt foarte motivata sa aduc tot ce imi sta in putere pentru a ajuta acest proiect sa se dezvolte in Bucuresti. </span>\n\n<span>Daca ar trebui sa numesc niste proiecte care s-ar potivi cu conceptul EdgeRyders, as alege Carusel (o organizatie bazate pe harm reduction care lucreaza cu comunitati defavorizate din Romania), Centrul National al Dansului Bucuresti (un centru cu o viziune inovatoare care se lupta de ani de zile sa creeze un spatiu dedicat experimentarii si dansului, dar cu putin sprijin sau fonduri), MIRA Rehab (o initiativa romaneasca de a transforma terapia fizica intr-o activitate distrativa cu ajutorul jocurilor video) si Funky Citizens (o organizatie bazata pe activism social cu foarte multe initiative interesante). As putea obtine contact direct cu primele doua organizatii prin contacte personale, iar pentru celelalte as incepe prin a scrie un mail informativ dar atractiv, si as continua printr-o convorbire telefonica si un contact personal. Cred ca toate aceste organizatii mentionate mai sus au identitati si viziuni foarte similare cu cele ale EdgeRyder, iar de aceea cred ca nu ar fi foarte greu sa fie aduse impreuna. Deoarece cred in valorile promovate de EdgeRyder si de acest proiect, as fi extrem de pasionata si de entuziasmata sa fac parte din acest concept si sa ajut la formarea si conectarea acestor parti. </span>\n\n<span>Mi-ar placea foarte mult sa ajut aceasta organizatie si sa lucrez pe durata verii cu acest concept. Momentan ma aflu inca in Olanda, unde trebuie sa imi termin cel de-al doilea an de facultate. Desi voi veni in Bucuresti abia la sfarsitul lui Iunie, mi-ar face placere sa sa ajut oricand este nevoie. </span>\n\n<span>Va multumesc, </span>\n\n<span>Alina Tomescu</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-22 19:31:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.286722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1252, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9089, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1281, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Empowerment</b>\n\n\u00a0If you want something done right, do it yourself. [proverb]\n\nI am an avid follower of this proverb. But often, it plays tricks on me. And I regret it.\n\nThe first time I heard about Spaghetti open data, I was seduced by its name. This is probably the most original name of all open data bases in the world! All the better, if in this case, Spaghetti open data found its way in the Italian government. \u00a0\n\nI would not mind having a 'Maple syrup open data' in my area. But it takes geeky people to do this, which is not unfortunately really my case. But even if I were a virtuoso geeky <em>extraordinaire</em>, I would not do this, for the following reasons:\n\nI often blow out the answers and provide information to policy makers (or to collaborators) in order to help them solve problems. But hacking in not in my lobbying bible. Why? Because I would be afraid to break the government's... karma! (Yeah, please don't laugh...!)\n\nWe cannot take the karma or destiny of someone else. No one can take the weight of another person. Therefore, I wouldn't want to take the weight of the government (which is not a real entity, it is composed of a gathering of human beings).\n\nIf the government does not do its job well, or if it is not responsible enough, this should not be the burden of citizens. I consider, however, that this is part of my responsibility, as a citizen, to make sure that the community is well managed. I am responsible for my thoughts, for my life, for my health, for my family, for my neighborhood, for my government, and even for the planet. (Because we are all connected... the oneness concept.) I also consider that it should go without saying, for citizens to co-manage the affairs of the state, in collaboration with the government. This is why I firmly believe in the open government philosophy.\n\nThe only thing that we can do, in terms of karma, is to assist another person to overcome his/her own karma by making he/she evolve on a different plane of consciousness, out of a lot of love, selflessness and understanding.\n\nFor example, humanitarian aid works better (lasts longer) when, instead of throwing money on a problem, it is taught to local people how to cope by themselves.\n\nI have learned over the years to bite my lips and say 'no'. With my big heart, not so long ago, I too would have been very tempted to do it myself. But now, I prefer to try to see the degree of awareness of people, and help them by showing them how to generate individual, community and organizational empowerment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-12 21:05:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.354562", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 498, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27752, "user_id": 292, "topic_id": 1316, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Yes!</b>\n\nOra ti rispondo :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-08 10:08:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.110824", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27032], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20739, "user_id": 2554, "topic_id": 4620, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>ideal types</b>\n\nReading this piece reminded me of the classes on Weber that I have had the opportunity to attend (with different professors) and like every one of those classes, your piece has definitely added another layer of interpretation into that understanding <a href=\"/u/meenabhatta\">@meenabhatta</a>.\u00a0\n\nThe thing about Weber's types of leadership, in a way, are based on this idea of \"ideal types\" - and ideals tend to not exist in reality?

The chaos of the world seems to grow larger, pushing us to further investigate the materiality of autonomy. The growing migrant crisis in Europe, the rise of proto-fascist forces across the world, the election of Trump here in the US. The continual melting of glaciers. The mundanities of crushing debt, the anxiety of our culture, and the everyday loneliness of the city. And for us here at Woodbine, the loss of a dear friend and comrade who was traveling to support the indigenous resistance at Standing Rock.\n\nWe don\u2019t bring these up to merely add to the general devastation. But because they are our reality. They exist and to not acknowledge that is to cover ourselves with superficial banalities. The crises that continue to arise are merely symptoms of the disintegration of a way of being in the world that is becoming rapidly untenable. So when we think of care, we must take on the task of being a bridge to a new way of being. \u00a0\n\nAt Woodbine, we are continuing to develop a path toward health autonomy. We are looking to meld many different modalities of health. \u00a0We have been experimenting with different projects and finding ways to build community. We\u2019ve had a garage gym with weekly fitness classes, open hours in our Resource Center, and ongoing public workshops. Our series of \u201cskill shares\u201d, has included subjects from acupuncture to foraging urban medicinal plants, to workshops on first aid and large discussions questioning what communal health really requires. Autonomous mental health infrastructure seems to be the most pressing immediate need of our community. This is a key place we are focusing our energies at the moment. We find that the act of sharing responsibilities, allowing for new innovation, and practicing vulnerability with our comrades are the first steps to addressing these larger questions of health and care.\n\nWith the proposed health care cuts as well as the general trend our government is taking, we fear that some heightened level of austerity will be upon us. As resources to critical health infrastructure are being threatened, as evidenced by Planned Parenthood cuts, the war on women\u2019s health, and the potentials for immigration officials to use health institutions as a screening tool, we are increasingly seeing a need to provide clinical as well as educational resources. Because of the immense cost and regulatory difficulty of providing clinical care in NYC, we need to seek and develop work-arounds. As we see the needs increasing, cuts being made and draconian measures to make non-violent actions to protect water punishable with prison sentences, we can only imagine a future where care for ourselves and our fellows will become increasingly criminalized. Therefore the steps we make to gain and share skills and develop subterranean practices of care can return some of the agency we\u2019ve lost to the professionalization of medicine and the profitable mystery that is our bodies. As we think about expanding our capacity, we don\u2019t want to just \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d of public health infrastructure. We need to slowly break our dependence on these institutions in all the ways that we can and also look for ways to use them to our advantage. We think this happens through sharing knowledge and skills, an emphasis on preventative care, and finding ways to manipulate existing structures to allow us to move forward on this path of autonomy. \u00a0\n\nWe believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power. Questions of care and health autonomy are pivotal to that progression. \u00a0From the Greek solidarity clinics to the Zapatistas \u201chealthcare from below\u201d to Black Panther Clinics and GynPunks, there is inspiration for this path all around us. \u00a0We begin by finding each other. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/introducing-openvillage-festival/36\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"85\">\n\n</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-02 14:06:13", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 11:54:42.391574", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 755, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 97.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3804], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5879, "user_id": 2374, "topic_id": 5846, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bb5223515648a1a3e074b2b3d3e9da2caa6479e6.png\" width=\"424\" height=\"500\">\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"> </h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">In 1995 two events happen that will forever transform Sweden.</h2>\n\nSweden joins the EU and the commercial Internet is born.\n\nThe free movement of people and goods within the EU has brought us much good as well has the free movement of information online. Both the multinational collaboration of the EU and the ever expanding digital infrastructure has created favourable conditions for people and business to grow. But at the same time the new structures creates new type of obstacles for the weakest groups in society. To become an included part of \"society\" today is harder than ever.

Specifically, the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">title</code> attribute is just a human-readable short description of the tag and encodes no additional information (so, nothing that you need to care about in network analysis). I'll copy in here the current attribute field help text from the <a href=\"/admin/config/content/ckeditor_styles/add\">CKEditor styles creation form</a> so you better see the make-up / syntax of the different fields:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Element:</strong> For ethnographic tags, enter \"span\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>Title:</strong> HTML title attribute to apply to the element; will appear as tooltip when mousing over markup in the editor and in the page on the frontend.\n\nFor ethnographic tags, put in tag type, a colon, and the full tag name so you can recognize it later. For example, \"Topic: International labor migration\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>Property:</strong> RDFa property attribute. For ethnographic tags, (1) let it contain the tag type, (2) use the \"eoe:\" prefix, (3) else use only lowercase characters and \"-\", for example: \"eoe:topic\" or \"eoe:place\"</li>\n\n<li><strong>Resource:</strong> RDFa resource attribute. For ethnographic tags, (1) let it contain a short / abbreviated name of a specific tag of the type you put in \"property\", (2) use the \"eoe:\" prefix, (3) use square brackets, (4) else use only lowercase characters and \"-\", for example: \"[eoe:intl-labor-migration]\" for a topic tag.\"</li>\n\n<li><strong>Class:</strong> [...] For ethnographic tags, you can leave this empty. Your tags will still be colored for you.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>\"The main question is nothing else is stored behind this \"eoe\" thing?\"</em>: Not sure I get this question. eoe is just a namespace I invented because it's a technical requirement in RDFa attributes. It is just meant to be memorizable and means \"Edgeryders Online Ethnography\".\n\n<em>\"Now, is it possible for me to create a \"view\" in which I can associate \"resource\", \"property\", as I do with comments and posts, or should I recreate it on the fly from what I\u00a0obtain?\"</em>: The <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">resource</code> attribute is the actual tag, meaning that the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">property</code> attribute's tag type information is not needed to identify a tag. Having both attributes in place is again just a technical detail to match the RDFa standard, which is IMHO a nice way for embedding the tagging in a web standards compliant way (making it safe to serve it as part of the regular content, as we do now).\n\nSo I understand your question as \"Can I create a view that lists me all nodes where tag eoe:some-tag-name appears in?\". Unfortunately that seems not possible in Drupal without developing a custom module; Drupal is not well-suited to search based on DOM content, and the only thing coming close to what we need here (<a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/index_htmlattr\">index_htmlattr</a>) is only for Drupal 6. What seems potentially possible however (using <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/views_xml_backend\">views_xml_backend</a>) is views like \"list me all ethnographic tags appearing in node with ID &lt;parameter here&gt;\". I assume that this is not really helpful, since analyzing which tags appear in a certain XML piece is just a simple task (using XPath or whatever you like for that) in your script as well. But in case you want to experiment with <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/views_xml_backend\">views_xml_backend</a> features, I'll gladly install it for you here.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-02 22:59:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:50.976461", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 621, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28391], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13883, "user_id": 2437, "topic_id": 3597, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>:)</b>\n\nMarkerfox seems super cool.

Introduction</h2>\n\n**Community management in Edgeryders.** As of 2020, the Edgeryders community spans over 40 countries and keeps on growing in numbers and diversity: We are at 5600+ members. Most of our interaction happens here, on the edgeryders.eu platform, and collaboration is our engine. That\u2019s how we get things done, and to be able to do that effectively there\u2019s a need to constantly inspire, help each other and acknowledge our peers\u2019 efforts. \nWe call it community management, although we don\u2019t get to \u201cmanage\u201d anyone, but we do take responsibility for some processes which I outline below. This is a manual which I hope is useful for any of you thinking of learning key, hands on tools in community building.  \n\n**Required skills.** A genuinely friendly attitude and [b]empathy[/b] (see above): that\u2019s pretty much all you need to get started in community management. The rest can be learned and you\u2019d be surprised of how intuitive it all is. We're all social beings after all.\n\n**What you get out of it.** Some of the perks of volunteering to do Edgeryders community management are the following:\n\n* You become an expert in online communities and really understand the social dynamics behind them: put that on your resume or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3045281). Plus, Edgeryders the social enterprise or fellow community members can give you a recommendation!\n\n* By developing interpersonal relationships with others and evolving into a highly respected member in the community you get to grow your own social capital and a global network\n\n* You get to be an empowered online platform user &amp; learn basic Drupal tweaks (beginner level, yet it feels empowering!), but most importantly, you become proficient in [online collaboration](/t/making-lote3/360/documentation-online-collaboration): a much needed skill in the times we're living.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Onboarding</h2>\n\nNew Edgeryders sign up and step into the space all the time and risk getting lost unless there\u2019s someone to show them the way! Automated confirmation and welcoming messages rarely do the job for us, so we very much foster a human approach.\n\nHow can you as community manager get in touch with new Edgeryders? You go to their user profile, look for the <kbd>Message</kbd> button and [write them a direct message](/t/-/6463#heading--2-9) which also goes into their email box. Simply say hi and introduce yourself, or tell them about the latest that\u2019s happening; it also helps if you make a connection with a topic they seem to be interested in based on their user profile. This is probably the most routine work in the community management, but highly rewarding when it pays off - people stay involved and enjoy being part of a community of like minded peers.\n\nLearn more:\n\n* Start by reading our [Discourse User Manual](/t/6463).\n* Read our [instructions how to welcome new members](/t/8305).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Nurture conversations</h2>\n\nWhat this means in a gist is:\n* Oversupply understanding\n* Keep a human face and tone\n* Stay empathetic\n* Assume the best\n\nPay attention to what others are saying. This tells the most about who the community members are and what they are interested in. A big part of community management is to read and comment what people are saying, encourage a diversity of voices, and foster a culture of respectful, meaningful interaction. \n\nWe don't need to become an automatic voice. Being a community manager doesn't make us robots or call center operators, we're humans with biases and opinions, and different interest levels in different topics and people. You will at some point choose to comment or highlight certain efforts more than others. Same with trolls, you can feed them or not. \n\nOn empathy: This gives relationships more chances from the get go. We want to cultivate generous behaviors through listening before making assumptions about why people say certain things ([read more](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.5869&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)). If in doubt, ask for clarifications.\n\nMany community members share common interests and although the platform is designed to increase serendipitous encounters, they can still miss each other. The good thing to do is, whenever you know people are doing similar things, invite them into conversations [using @mentions](/t/6463#heading--2-6) whenever key content could be interesting for them, or directly introduce them to each other on Twitter, Facebook etc.. As a community manager, you'll get to know most of people's social handles, so this will come easy to you.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Synthesize, curate, engage</h3>\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is part of the professional community manager\u2019s job, but Edgeryders is entirely volunteer driven and the more we teach ourselves to work with content aka communicate properly, community managers and not only, the better! Sharing information and latest about what Edgeryders are doing is key, and it can be done mostly through periodic blog posts or platform posts in various relevant [projects](/t/all-our-projects/40), and through our mailing list and social media. Communicating and articulating thoughts in writing and also in public/for larger audiences is key to: \n\n1. Conveying our values, our work, our successes: eg through [b]curation[/b] \u201ca form of pattern recognition \u2013 pieces of information or insight which over time amount to an implicit point of view\u201d \u2013 says one of my favourite writers [Maria Popova](http://www.fastcompany.com/3018236/most-creative-people-2012/51-maria-popova)\n\n    **Tip:** never assume everybody follows what\u2019s happening in the community. We need to re-package &amp; summarize content all the time, even if it may seem obsolete.\n\n2. Gathering and making use of relevant resources online: an additional challenge is to communicate in an [b]engaging style[/b], one that prompts responses and enthusiasm among fellow Edgeryders and triggers collaboration.\n\n    **Tip:** the simplest structure when writing for engagement can be this:\n\n    * What is the context or perspective from which you are writing the post?\n\n    * What challenge are you trying to solve/ what do you intend to achieve with the post?\n\n    * What are the steps to get started?\n\n    * Call to action: what do you want those reading the post to do? What action should they take in order to support you?\n\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Organise community calls</h3>\n\nCommunity calls are online gatherings:\n\n* facilitated by a host or the community manager. \n* rigorously documented (preferably this role is extended from community managers to participants).\n* multiple formats: sometimes they are an introduction to the project, or present opportunity for participants to find out more about the ongoing calls for participation; other times they focus on discussing a good community story and will have as guests the community members who can interact live with others; and other times they will be open work sessions where participants build local events \n* an opportunity for sourcing new stories, people and projects! if participants are not yet registered on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/), community managers invite them for a one-on-one chat later which will be meant as an informal interview where (a) community managers ask questions and take notes (or record it); (b) help write the story in 1st person; check with participants if it is accurate and can be posted under their name; if needed, we create accounts for them, and they can log in after and change their password; That way, we support people who are just coming into contact with the project to share their story on the platform and answer questions to their story in the comments.\n\nSteps to run a call:\n1) Launch an invitation to join the call in a +New Topic on edgeryders.eu in any of the subforums (Wellbeing in Europe, Internet of Humans, Campfire etc.)\nMake sure to include a topic of the call + date + time + place with link where the call is happening (choose a channel like Zoom or other - see below). If there is a registration form, add it.\n2) Send everyone who registers a reminder 1 day before the call.\n3) Facilitate the call - present the agenda; do a round of introductions so that each participant can tell why they are there; moderate a conversation where everyone shares their input with the group\n4) Record the call/ Take notes during the call\n5) End the call with a list of what each person is going to do after - small tasks of 30mins are OK.\n6) Publish the summary of the call and reminder of the tasks agreed\n7) Circulate the summary to get new input into the topic discussed\n8) If needed, rinse and repeat - organise the next call to continue the conversation!\n\nThe calls are hosted: \n\n**1) on Zoom.**\nZoom is an easy to use communication platform and suited to our needs because:\n* It allows people to respond to our invitation ahead of time, by leaving an email address and name and making it possible to stay in touch before and after the meeting\n* Requires minimal installation effort: when people click the meeting link to join, it prompts them to install Zoom video meetings on their computer\n* It hosts more than the maximum 10 people allowed on google hangouts or skype (thanks to our edgeryders annual subscription)\n* It allows audio, video, chat, screen sharing and moderator options\n\nReferences:\n * Learn how to work with Zoom in the [Zoom manual here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/zoom-video-conferencing-manual/8872).\n\n**2) on Edgeryders live room:** http://now.edgeryders.eu\n\n* Pro tips for hosting healthy conference calls are described in our Distributed collaboration manual - see section [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--5-6).\n* To get help with organising a call, contact @Noemi.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Support for outreach </h3>\n\nThis is not entirely relevant to community management, but it is useful to learn especially when working with limited resources and when almost everyone involved in maintaining the ER infrastructure needs to step in and help cover the need. \nIt means we:\n\n* share updates through our personal social media accounts. In most active and financially supoorted projects, the updates are provided by the communications team directly to you in a visually friendly format. \n* for core collaborators: you can get access to [official ER social media channels]((/t/social-media-team/444/thoughts-on-managing-edgeryders-twitter-handle)): facebook, twitter and other social media to post relevant updates about what\u2019s happening with the community and latest posts. You can also shed a spotlight on something great someone has achieved. Highlighting members' efforts is an advice I've been given a lot (thanks Dorotea!) and we need to get ever better at acknowledging individual efforts. Luckily, a [Social Media team](/t/social-media-team/444) is here to help, but not surprisingly, this too needs (re)activation and constant inspiration :)\n\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Platform admin</h2>\n\nTo be more effective as an online community managers we all need to use our web platform as efficient as possible, meaning we can learn to make use of functionalities which ease the process of getting in touch with others and getting information or updates across.\n\nThis goes beyond becoming a proficient platform user (by pinging Edgeryders, creating tasks and other things in our [Discourse User Manual](/t/6463)), and also involves content editing and content clean-up when needed. Make sure to read our [Discourse Admin Manual](/t/6647) and the official [Discourse Moderation Guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/63116).\n\nIf you become an Edgeryders community manager, we\u2019ll get you admin powers and make sure someone in the developers\u2019 team can give you a crash course in using Discourse platform features.\n\n#### SPOTLIGHT: Edgesense - a tool for monitoring and intervening\n\n[Edgesense](http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com/) is our own tool for social network analysis helping detect emergence. The dashboard allows community managers and anyone interested to monitor network growth in terms of number of users (nodes), relationships (edges) and specialized subcommunities (modularity) over time. You can start by testing it with the interactive tutorial.\n\nEdgesense has been initiated by @Alberto &amp; the Wikitalia team under [CATALYST](http://catalyst-fp7.eu/). Read more about it in its own [platform group here](/t/edgesense/317) and about the techs behind it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wikitalia/edgesense)\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58150eeea94d017659357edc03587384fd71c679.PNG)<br> <em>The Edgeryders network on the 8th of July, 2014</em>\n\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5.

Edgeryders course materials</h3>\n\n#### The Edgeryders Academy\n\nStarting May 2018, a detailed course on community management is available on the **[EDGERYDERS ACADEMY](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/)**. It consists of written lessons and practical exercises for you to become acquainted with what an online community is and how you can immerse yourself in it, as well as community manage it.\n\nWe recommend taking on a webinar with Edgeryders lead community managers before taking the course. It will give you a better understanding of what is available and help you make the most out of the online lessons.\nGet in touch with noemi at noemi@edgeryders.eu!\n\n\n#### Course materials\n\nHere is the full training content (presentations and toolkit) of the Edgeryders course in online community management held by @johncoate and @noemi:\n\n1.

Others about online community management</h3>\n\n#### Principles of Cyberspace Innkeeping\n\nA book (full text [here](http://www.johncoate.com/innkeeping.html)) written by the legendary [John Coate](/u/johncoate) (a member of Edgeryders too!). Core principles:\n\n> * The currency is human attention. Work with it. Discourage abuse of it.\n> * You are in the relationship business.\n> * Welcome newcomers. Help them find their place.\n> * Show by example.\n> * Strive to influence and persuade.\n> * Have a big fuse. Never let the bottom drop out.\n> * Use a light touch. Don't be authoritarian.\n> * Affirm people. Encourage them to open up.\n> * Expect ferment. Allow some tumbling.\n> * Don't give in to tyranny by individual or group.\n> * Leave room in the rules for judgment calls.\n> * Encourage personal and professional overlap.\n> *  Think \"tolerance.\"\n\n\n#### The art of hosting good online conversations\n\nOriginally published, 1998, by Howard Rheingold. The article in full can be read [here](https://medium.com/@hrheingold/the-art-of-hosting-good-online-conversations-38c6d06642d0#.ohklbnbgl).\n\n> A Host is \u2026\n> \n> * A host is like a host at a party. You don\u2019t automatically throw a great party by hiring a room and buying some beer. Someone needs to invite an interesting mix of people, greet people at the door, make introductions, start conversations, avert fisticuffs, encourage people to let their hair down and entertain each other.\n> * A host is also an authority. The host is the person who enforces whatever rules there may be, and will therefore be seen by many as a species of law enforcement officer.\n> * A host is also an exemplar. Good hosts model the behavior they want others to emulate: read carefully and post entertainingly, informatively, and economically, acknowledge other people by name, assume good will, assert trust until convinced otherwise , add knowledge, offer help , be slow to anger, apologize when wrong, politely ask for clarification, exercise patience when your temper flares.\n> * A host is also a cybrarian. Good hosts nurture the community memory, pointing newcomers to archives, providing links to related conversations, past and present, hunting down resources to add to the collective pool of knowledge \u2014 and teaching others to do it. Well performed voluntary cybrarianship is contagious.\n> * A host can be a character in the show, but the show is collaborative improvisation, with the audience onstage.\n> * All hosts are members of a community of hosts. You can\u2019t host communities without communities of hosts.\n\n\n#### An Abecedarium For Community Management\n\nBy Meg Pickard.

Your future \"job\"?</h3>\n\nCommunity management is definitely among the buzz words in the labour market today, alongside other interesting and similar \"jobs\" (should we still be interested to think in terms of jobs):\n\n* **Network weaver:** is someone who is aware of the networks around them and explicitly works to make them healthier. They do this by helping people identify their interests and challenges, connecting people strategically where there\u2019s potential for mutual benefit, and serving as a catalyst for self-organizing groups. ([source](http://www.bethkanter.org/network-weaver-handbook/))\n\n* **Catalyst:** nurture and care for the company's inner spirit, provoke new ways of thinking, and motivate and inspire\n\n* **VP of Happiness:** keep the people happy, sing to them when they\u2019re down (for more funny names [see Job Titles of the Future](http://hellogiggles.com/job-titles-of-the-future-chief-detonators-wanted))\n\n* **Cybrarian:** nurture the community memory, pointing newcomers to archives, providing links to related conversations\u200b (by [Howard Rheinghold](https://medium.com/@hrheingold/the-art-of-hosting-good-online-conversations-38c6d06642d0#.ohklbnbgl))\n\nThe detailed roles of what you really do on a daily basis are best described by @johncoate in the Edgeryders Academy (see below).\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5.

Both are meant as ways to make efforts easier by pooling manpower and agreeing to \"sync\" to each other. Without syncing, there is no commonality. One cannot be a nonpracticising Benedictine monk! You know this better than anyone, as your main contribution was on the rituals side.\n\nBut, I would argue, this is very much <em>not</em>\u00a0\"repelling\". Because:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Protocol \u2013 like the Rule itself \u2013 allows you to do almost anything, from herbal gardens to slower-than-light interstellar travel to meditation.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Forms of cooperation with people and orgs who do not follow Protocol are possible, necessary and welcome. It will simply be less tight. A historical example: Benedictines cooperated closely with Charlemagne towards the vision a Holy Roman Empire: a single Europe-wide, Christian, pacified political entity. The Emperor and his collaborators were obviously never monks, and were not subject to the Rule. I imagine this collaboration required some kind of interface: one or more senior monks with a special dispensation to live <em>extra moenia</em>, dispatched to court to participate in that effort, and reconvening frequently in the \u00a0monastery closest to the capital in Aachen. On a much less grand level,\u00a0both Edgeryders and the (still mysterious) unMonastery corporation partner up with orgs like companies and universities, and work together with them without demanding they use their same methods.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI do agree with the principle of treasuring diversity. It's in Protocol too: algorithm 01, \"be open\". No argument.\n\nIf anything, I would argue the <em>unMonastery</em> is exclusionary. Remember <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>'s words: \"to become part of the group, or to leave\" (<a href=\"/t/politics-at-the-unmonastery-a-meditation-and-an-exhortation/3027/13\">source</a>). At the time we were discussing the case of David: he had been living in the House, selected in the same way as the others, yet, it was claimed, \"he has never part of the group\" (<a href=\"/t/politics-at-the-unmonastery-a-meditation-and-an-exhortation/3027/15\">source</a>). Why? \"arriving at the unMonastery with his partner, his son, a project that consisted of managing others', and independent funding\", in other words, doing things differently. Who decides whether one is part of the group? The incumbents. So much for treasuring diversity, huh?\n\nAt the same time, for all its many faults, Edgeryders is up and running. Early participants have dropped out, some even starting their own spinoffs (an impressive achievement in itself!); and new people have gravitated to it, without much drama or witch hunts, and that, my friend, I interpret as a sign of health. And here's another one: fairness. Some financial benefits have been derived, and they have been spread out reasonably well, with (I may be off by one or two, our accounts are being processed) 28 non-directors including yourself receiving cash (53,454.64\u00a0 EUR, of which 42,528.98 in fees and 10,925.66 in travel grants)\u00a0in financial year 2014-2015 \u2013 this does not include unMonastery stipends and other unMonastery related expenses, which sum up to another 32K EUR for a grand total of about 85K EUR handed over in cash to the community. <strong>Practically all of these paid assignments were allocated via open calls, as opposed to directed to the inner circle</strong>.\u00a0Directors have received 53,151.43.\u00a0Ben has received more than I have, for example. I would say the economics of diversity are there!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-09-26 09:35:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.497250", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 615, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18793], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23069, "user_id": 89, "topic_id": 1661, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Actionable idea. </b>\n\nIndeed it is a very actionable idea!!

Since we started running late for a meeting with the owners of the Casa where we stay now, he generously offered us getting his car from garage and giving us lift to the other part of town!\n\nOnce arrived at <a href=\"http://www.homelidays.it/casa-vacanze/p6698340\">Casa Vacanze</a>, we received another warm meeting from its owners. After short tour around the house and discussing all we needed to know, I started cooking a simple lunch from minimalistic package of ingredients, which they have brought for our landing. They didn't stay for lunch so we ate quickly, feeling very hungry after 24h (me) and 16h (<a href=\"/u/mstn\">@mstn</a>) travel. Monday 1PM and both of us ready to rock!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Re-Exploring</h3>\n\nTraditionally we landed in a place with no internet connection. Knowing that beforehand we already arranged with another good old unMonasterians friend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nico.squalo\">Squalo</a>, that we will pick a 3G router from him. We walked through Sassi in surprisingly strong wind and little snow. A rather big film crew had their trucks all over and group of actors wearing costumes wondered around. Of course it made us think of our dear brother <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>\u00a0right away. Also on that trip we <a href=\"/t/the-unmonastery-rides-again-untransit-development-sprint-in-matera/4090/4\">a took photo with two camels</a>, which became popular online very quickly ;)\n\nWhen we arrived to place where Squalo lives, we didn't find him here, but our dear friend <a href=\"/u/ritao\">@RitaO</a>\u00a0happened to pass by and we enjoyed yet another round of warm welcoming :D During our short chat we discussed picking up wireless antennas, which I brought as gift from Freifunk Berlin and tried in last few weeks pass it to emerging <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ninux.basilicata/\">Ninux Basilicata community</a>\u00a0also active in Matera. I guess because of lunch time, we spotted <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/raffaella.pontrandolfi\">Raffaella</a> passing by and had very quick chat with her, while she waited for a bas on Linea Sassi.\n\nWe decided to visit friends from <a href=\"http://www.benetural.com/en/\">Casa Netural</a> next, where we received another warm greeting and had chance to to catch up with surfing online. Luckily Squalo have send us a message with details of where and when we can meet him. It turned out that he stayed at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OpenLabMatera\">Open Lab Matera</a>. We rushed there to meet him and to our great joy, we also got to see <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mimi.coviello\">Mimi</a> and our beloved unBrother <a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>. Guess what... another round of very warm greetings &lt;3 To make it even more funny, when we went online there, I had online chat with <a href=\"/u/julianavanh\">@julianavanh</a>, who I've just met in Berlin during <a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/transmediale/\">unMonastery Summit @Transmediale</a>\u00a0and who mentioned plans of visiting Matera very soon, some more proxying of (e-)greetings happened.\n\nMarc reminded us that shops close in the afternoon so we better wait till 5PM before going to get very needed SIM card from Tre.it . We enjoyed stay at Open Lab Matera for little longer, drinking tea, eating sweets and having playful conversations. We also already started looking at travel arrangements to leave Matera after Open Data Day on 21st. Once near the time we expected shop to open, we borrowed 3G router and a power extension, then left saying \"See you tomorrow!\". Today we most likely will visit this great space once again!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Coliving &amp; Coworking Space(s)</h3>\n\nAfter getting minimal food supply on our way, we returned to Casa Vacanze with 3G router and SIM card, something crucial for our work! Since we have available a space relatively big for two people. We arranged clear <strong>working</strong> space, <strong>sleeping</strong> space and <strong>cooking &amp; dining</strong> space and of course <strong>Zero Waste</strong> station! Having that ready, we prepared simple buy yummy dinner and dove into cyberspace once again.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Planning and Tracking</h3>\n\nAs we dedicated this day to bootstrapping, I went ahead and created a <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/Y9GabYtD/untransit-dev-sprint-matera\">Trello board</a> to keep track of all the relevant tasks. As well as <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6gVU-928vbCfjFSczN4MVJ6aFgtdk1lNXQ3V2FrNWYxaU5NcHNHNl9RbjZqenlCMy1RUE0\">Google Drive folder</a> for tracking spreadsheets and relevant digital artifacts, both with public read access so please check them out! As part of our presentation for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1563343753952133/\">Open Data Day in Matera on Feb 21st</a>, we plan to give short overview of how me made this dev sprint happen, including all the data we track as open data! You can already find some new uploads in <a href=\"http://dati.comune.matera.it/en/organization/unmonastery\">unMonastery organization on Open Data Matera CKAN</a>.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Next Steps</h3>\n\nToday we start first steps on polishing Matera GTFS feed, you can follow our work on mentioned trello board! We will also go over relevant github repositories and issues to create clearer roadmap for next two weeks. In the evening possibly <a href=\"/u/piersoft\">@piersoft</a>\u00a0will visit us which should come of great help to clarify eventual mapping party with hands on skillsharing next weekend on 14th. Myself I will need to dedicate some time for obligations related to my participation in various <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a> Groups, today two of them have weekly teleconf in our timezone evening. Please stay tuned for next update tomorrow, hopefully earlier in the morning!

I know that there's a lot of interest in urban environments and living in the city, re-appropriating public spaces and really use them as commons, but that;s not environment per se, is it?\u00a0\n\nAnd what about language on commons? It keeps coming up but I have a hard time fully understanding what it means.. maybe if we could explain this it would make it easier for people to come up with insights?\n\nit seems weird because we've been talking about commons for some time now, and when we're supposed to go deeper in the subject I find some basics are missing.
