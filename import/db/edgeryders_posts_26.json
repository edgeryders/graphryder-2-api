To be honest, I don't see myself as an expert yet, but I am utterly in love with how miss Raworth is expressing her view and inspires others - so, maybe a bit biassed. Buuuut I can tell for sure, upon reading her book and having met her, that she is quite modest and really interested in facilitating real change. She does say in her book that she bases her theories on existing works of other economists and thinkers, giving them full credit and admitting she drew her views from their books. I find that in general, there are very few innovative and new ideas in this world - it's kinna the same content we have available, but we tell different stories about the same truths. Stories to ourselves and to each other. \n\nWhat Kate did differently was to imagine an easier expression of an old notion: the limits to growth and ecological economy. And she's actually using that for concrete projects. 2 years ago in Amsterdam, I was there for the first discussions between her and Circle Economy to discuss the city doughnout and in one year they actually came up with it and mapped 17 urban policies for the city. Yes, I do admit they are quite specific to Amsterdam, but the creators-the team at City of Amsterdam, Circle Economy, together with Kate are people I trust and that could spark changes in how other cities build their strategies. \n\nI plan on following them as closely as possible to understand how easily applicable the plan is. But for now, I am quite optimistic. And, again: it is incredibly important how we express our creeds and our plans for creating a better future. To me and to the people around me that has been proven multiple times. This woman found a great recipe for the time being, let's hope it will produce significant impact. So let's just appreciate that and at least study the doughnout as a useful tool for communicating how our society and its economy needs to change.", "created_at": "2020-07-08 15:21:04.686319", "updated_at": "2020-07-08 15:21:04.686319", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 352, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 57.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79754], "is_liked_by": [3, 428, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4399, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4366, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey, I set up a soundcloud account that we can use to host 180 minutes\u00a0 discussion on (more with monthly cost of 4, unlimited with 9\u20ac).

Once we have it approved by the rest of the team, there will be some recoding to be done.\n\nHere are the main ideas.\n\n1.\tWe need to reduce the number of general categories and make sure that they help us address the central concern of POPREBEL: what are the cultural/cognitive maps people carry in their heads that are providing a \u201cbackground\u201d for their choices, also political? Such maps (a component of \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d) can be reconstructed \u2013 we are assuming \u2013 via a disciplined analysis of the conversations recorded on the platform.\n2.\tThe hierarchy will have three levels (see examples below)\n3.\tWe propose that we create the following system of categories, some of which will become parental codes, but all will belong to the highest level of our three-level hierarchy:\n\n3.1.\tType of action or inaction (Examples from \u201cold\u201d typology: engagement tactics\n3.2.\tActor (types)\n3.3.\tIssue (Example: \u201ceducation\u201d [level 2] --> \u201cright to education\u201d [level 3]\n3.4.\tIdeology\n3.5.\tEmotions\n3.6.\tValue(s)\n3.7.\tPlaces/locations/scale\n3.8.\tInstitutions\n3.9.\tTime:\n3.9.1.\tHistory/past\n3.9.2.\tDiagnosis of the present\n3.9.3.\tPrognosis\n4.\tWhat emerges is the project\u2019s \u201cgrammar.\u201d For example, we can construct the following sentence: John, who is a teacher [actor type] writes about a lack of clean water in his appartment complex [situation] and decided to form a group [type of action] and follow his belief in the need to help people [ideology], particularly in his town [place/location]. He is intimates that he is very angry [emotion] and compares the present crisis to a much better situation before the fall of communism [history].\n5.\tQuestion: Is it possible to see a map of \u201cmothers\u201d only? For example, we will code Hannah\u2019s statement (she is a teacher): \u201cI am angry that many people around here have no access to good education,\u201d as \u201canger\u201d <----> \u201cright to education\u201d \u2013 both codes at Level 3, but would like to see also \u201cemotion\u201d <---->\u201cissue\u201d at Level 1, so we can see how many issues are approached in an emotional manner.", "created_at": "2020-09-12 16:44:49.432858", "updated_at": "2020-09-12 16:47:31.582895", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 419, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 32.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6339], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15751, "user_id": 3143, "topic_id": 804, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks Deborah + some considerations</b>\n\nThanks @deborah_ligorio for your application!\n\nI agree with @Alberto that the approach is in line with the OpenCare ethos and practice, cool :)\n\nI have some questions but I will try to first off reply to Alberto by interpreting the text above: to my understanding the idea behind the digital service is one where in a first phase the experience is initially one-to-many and the users are receiving feedback,\u00a0but what they are actually mostly doing is feeding some kind of artificial intelligence that will generate the knowledge about the specific intolerance. the many-to-many kind of interactions will come at later stage as a consequence of the first phase.\n\n- - - I'm not 100% sure about my interpretation and would love Deborah to give us more hints about it.\n\nOn a side note, I would be interested to know if you (Deborah) have already thought about the interaction of the main task: adding the data\u00a0tailored to your specific situation.\n\nIn my experience, even when the committment is pretty high (meaning the tool can for instance improve the quality of your life), a system that involves a lot of data entry tends to have a short life cycle, (unless the feedback is clear and constant and meaningful).\n\nI'm very interested in approaches where for instance the system knows when is the right time to ask you for the data, or in general where the data entry becomes organic, integrated in your routine, almost happening in the background.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI will check the apps that you have linked, lately I have been looking at \"Headspace\", it's a different field but there can be some interesting insights there.\n\nLast, I would suggest you to check\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/allergoki#comment-27544, there could be an interesting bond between the two concepts.\n\nciao :)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-29 15:21:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.494724", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 333, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38896, "user_id": 2105, "topic_id": 7587, "post_number": 2, "raw": "the project of Ain Elbee'ah , was a tank to collect the water of Wudu' and purify it to be used in planting and irrigating the street trees <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/523e681a2a8889da7353b0db42ee4b2853716ac2.jpg\" width=\"579\" height=\"523\">\nsorry for bad resolution .\nP.s @hazem I'm not working with Ain Elbee'ah any more, and I don't have any updated information about their work.

I was thinking of an Issue tracking app / platform to coordinate the helpers in Nepal or any other region.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>People can set an gps?!-based issue point which is collected by a platform. This issue point could have different \"labels\" e.g. health, energy, technology or contruction. - Or an issue point cloud be set up with \"fire point\" in different colours. The colours stand for the labels. e.g. red stands for health, green for energy, which are mentioned before. These firepoints could be collected by a drone with an appropriate app qutomatically or by satellite pictures.</li>\n\n<li>or an issue point could be set by a special hashtag on twitter or facebook and the geolocation is sended automatically to the issue tracking platform, e.g.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/geocare?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1060600173969666\">\u202a#\u200egeocare\u202c</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/health?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1060600173969666\">\u202a#\u200ehealth\u202c</a>.</li>\n\n<li>The Hub-platform collects all the issuepoints and visualizes them on a map.</li>\n\n<li>Helpers could take an issue point to \"work\" on it.</li>\n\n<li>Each issue point has a status like \"Open\", \"In progress\" or \"Closed\". Helper could comment or chat on each issue to communicate or specify the issue or order more helpers.</li>\n\n<li>I also was thinking of some devices for regions with a higher risk rate. For example some kind of blackbox which is sending signals and infos automatically in case of an issue. Or some kind of smartwatches with a little app. This app contains the different issue labels an an geo-location functionality. First helpers or scouts could use this device to set issues fast.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo long for the moment. I know, that this is nothing final but i want to share my thoughts and ask for your feedback.

The intent is for the participants to have access to these great influential people and to learn from them, their experiences and life stories.\n\nI guess the main common thread I found with EdgeRyders (as I understand the community through what I read) is the desire to expose the people I work with, wether they are clients, suppliers, partners etc to valuable &amp; interesting experiences and people through which they can grow as people and professionals.\n\nI do this by organising outdoor experiences in the <a href=\"http://www.wild-thing.ro\">Wild Thing</a> project, in house happenings <a href=\"http://www.12connections.com\">12connections</a>\u00a0or personal challenge to prove that the once perceived impossible deed is possible <a href=\"http://www.thechallenge.ro\">The Challenge</a>.\n\nOne of the challenges is the people's skepticism in getting involved in something different compared to what they are used to but also the flood of \"average\" projects that bombard you from all directions. I learned that if you wait for everything to be perfect before you start doing something, you'll never start. Getting your hands dirty, finding ways to better target your audience and above all do quality work that recommends you ... are the main levers I use in passing those challenges.\n\nSome really cool projects / people that are trying to make a change in the communities around them are: <a href=\"http://teachforromania.org\">Teach For Romania</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adventurediplomacy.org\">Adventure Diplomacy</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.impacthub.ro\">Impact HUB Bucharest</a>.

It's because, like you said, it will probably never be perfect because people take it in different directions.\n\nThere's really no audience for this project. This is what I think is most challenging when it comes to the different projects people are flooded with, like you rightfully say - making a case that engaging with each other is meaningful in itself because it leads to bigger things that they get to do together in their own fields.\u00a0\n\nI have a very good friend teaching in Teach for Romania, and the story that is interesting for me, for example, is not so much about the initiative itself - which seems already on a great path, quite resourceful and drawing media attention (maybe I'm wrong) - but her story of being young and ambitious, and making a HUGE compromise to go into teaching in one of the poorest communities in Romania. That is a personal project, one could say, and deserves more credibility than it's receiving because it tells us something about the new generation of teachers needing so much more support.\n\n\u00a0Anyway, can't go into too much right now, but if you're interested to know Edgeryders better there's a <a href=\"/en/agora/weekly-community-call-thursday-at-1100-cest-on-skype-0\">community call </a>tomorrow at 11 (12 Ro time).

Because Edgeryders was always a community about <em>doing stuff</em>. This tribe does not gather around a topic (like \"climate action\", \"anti corruption\" etc.) but around a method (doing something successfully, being heard, having ones share of influence). Naturally, everyone in such a tribe comes with their own projects: the things where they practice self-directed action and success. This does not mean Edgeryders is about meta-networking, instead people simply belong to multiple tribes and communities at once, which is perfectly fine.\n\nSo: Edgeryders is a community of its own, <em>not</em> a community of communities. <em>But</em>. We must not make the mistake to assume Edgeryders are members of exclusively this community. 99% of them are not, and we should not treat them that way. Edgeryders will be that community to which you come back to, not the one where you hang out all the time.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-14 18:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.394043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 246, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36695, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6279, "post_number": 4, "raw": "hello Nabeel, you're welcome to come by - there is a very good train connection between London and Brussels, we're starting on 19 of October and finish at night on the 21 of October. did you see the program already?

Maybe you did not realise, but for three days we lived in openvillage. In a series of posts, I will present the fundamentals of Openvillage, in terms of lessons I learned from this wonderful experience.\n\n----------\n## Lesson I : The Feeling of Belonging to a Community\n\nFrom virtual exchanges to physical presence, some core values have been set up during our various interactions; allowing everyone to feel as a family regardless of its particularity. Thus, on the basis of transparency, inclusiveness and devotion to the community, we co-construct our sense of belonging to the Edgeryders community.\n\n**-\tTransparency**  \n\nBefore the festival, as an external observer, the first trace of transparency that I noticed in Edgeryders community was his discussion forum. This one is open to everyone, without barriers and all topics are debated in public. The summit of this transparency was manifested in the documentation of the festival. Thanks to the USB keys on the table, each participant had access to all the documents of the festival and had the opportunity to intervene in the Google doc. This opportunity to participate and give your opinion like ancient members, facilitates integration and allows everybody to feel a full member of the Edgeryders community.\n\n**-\tInclusion**\nIn terms of inclusion, the festival has been successful; starting with the different spaces chosen for the meetings (La serre & Quai du Hainaut). Whoever we are, no matter where we come from, these spaces were open to all cultures and everyone recognised himself in these places. Human interactions were very warm, never saw an isolated participant unless it was voluntary. We also note the efforts that have been made to avoid the exclusion due to language. Thus, the participants repeated their sentences each time they were not understood, they spoke softly to allow non-English speakers to better understand them, and we even had translation from English to French during the festival. I cannot avoid mentioning the Code of Conduct, Consensus (on Diet, Dish washing, toilets...)which ensure a mutual respect among all participants.\n\n**-\tDevotion to the community**\n\nThe fact that there was no designated a specific officer at the festival, allowed everyone to be involved in different activities. From the first day, everyone has found a way to make themselves useful, either by arranging the room, by welcoming the newcomers, or by cooking for the others (special mention). This is a proof of humility and  guarantee of equality between the different participants.\n\n**- Generosity (by @alberto)**\nBeing immersed in a generous community feels great. But we have an ulterior motive for pushing this ethic: a group that practices generosity is better at collaborating, because people relax and do not have to spend time and energy watching their backs, making sure that they do not get exploited etc. This way, people can focus on doing real work. A group that works like that is more efficient. We need that, because we do not have the traditional attributes of efficiency (scale, scientific management etc.).\nOn the other hand, generosity and collaboration are super easy to break down. As @johncoate said during his presentation \"there is no community if the toilets don't flush\". This means that all of us have to stay close to practical work (cooking, cleaning, taking notes...), and celebrate it.\n\nIt emerges from this beautiful experience that the feeling of belonging is the first care that can be given to the individual. Feeling surrounded, understood and considered is the basis of a sincere and strong commitment within the community. This is the first foundation of openvillage. However, given the current ill of our society, we would be tempted to say that it is almost impossible to recover and find this kind of feeling. But no, the festival has given us another very big lesson that will be the subject of **my next post entitled: Resilience: tribute to Zyara.**\n\n_In the meantime, I invite you to improve this text on the way you lived and perceived your belonging to the group Edgeryders._.", "created_at": "2017-10-31 14:01:13.244132", "updated_at": "2017-11-27 17:51:37.246317", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 677, "wiki": true, "reads": 22, "score": 319.4, "like_count": 11, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3704, 3067, 3362, 4034, 3, 2915, 1935, 4, 3904, 2569, 3311], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14867, "user_id": 2598, "topic_id": 4400, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>INTRODUCTION FROM COMMUNITY SERVICE OF NEPAL</b>\n\nHello there and THANK YOU for noticing our work and inviting us to join you on this site.

How can we avoid being tracked?\u201d** **Are there concrete examples from other countries we should involve in the conversation?**:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/germany-introduces-corona-virus-tracing-app-why-arent-people-more-sceptical/13906\n\nFinally, we would like to draw you attention again to this ongoing conversation about a whole system approach for the developing internet which is on the core of the NGI interest and relevant for our path into the future:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766\n\nThank you very much for being a great community!\n\n*If you have any questions on how to orient yourself or how to contribute feel free to ask me (@mariaeuler)*", "created_at": "2020-07-08 15:48:15.996230", "updated_at": "2020-07-08 15:52:36.093291", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 639, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [79674, 80100, 79670, 74176, 79137, 52655], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38917, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 7167, "post_number": 2, "raw": "", "created_at": "2017-10-31 14:33:55.640137", "updated_at": "2017-10-31 14:33:55.640137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86287, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 14646, "post_number": 43, "raw": "Have a look at these Matt: \n\n**Area 3: Industry for a clean and circular economy**\nTopic 1: [Closing the industrial carbon cycle to combat climate change](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-3-1-2020;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=green%20deal;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=31087050;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=Thu%20Nov%2005%202020%2009:55:27%20GMT%2B0100%20%28heure%20normale%20d%E2%80%99Europe%20centrale%29;startDateGte=Thu%20Nov%2005%202020%2009:55:27%20GMT%2B0100%20%28heure%20normale%20d%E2%80%99Europe%20centrale%29;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState)\n\n**Area 4: Energy and resource efficient buildings**\n[Building and renovating in an energy and resource efficient way](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-4-1-2020;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,2;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=31045243;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState)\n\n**Area 7: Biodiversity and ecosystems**\n[Restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-7-1-2020;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,2;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=31045243;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState)\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_at": "2020-11-05 09:08:39.498553", "updated_at": "2020-11-05 09:08:39.498553", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 275, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 47.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86281], "is_liked_by": [5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79795, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 29, "raw": "\n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:27, topic:13988\"]\ny, we have a code stigmatisation, an example of which may be labelling, and we encounter a text where a set of labels is listed. So a person mentions that people call her a feminazi, a dike, etc. Is it ok to code every label? I know we should rather avoid coding word-for-word, but some of them, like Polish \u201cpisior\u201d (a Law and Justice hardcore supportrer) wil keep popping up and we think are worth coding.\n[/quote]\n\nI would code this, yes, and code it with double quotations to indicate that it is an invivo code (as is the convention we have agreed upon, see the wiki). I would assume this occurs in a sentence, so attach the code to the sentence and not just the word. \n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:27, topic:13988\"]\nJan came up with the idea to introduce the code constructing_common_identity with children such as: nation, religious community, Europeans, etc. I have already noticed the issues of common identity being raised here and there, people speaking of the need for finding, (re) building it, complaining of it being dismantled, so I think it might be worthwhile to have it.\n[/quote]\n\nUse the code \"constructing common identity\" --  that is an excellent code. But it is not a parent code. Just code it along with the other codes, and it will appear as a co-occurrence in the graph. \n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:27, topic:13988\"]\nMatters related to inclusion/exclusion dychotomy seem to play a central role in our investigations. Have you guys come across any mentions of these two? How do you code them?\n[/quote]\n\nIf you look at my codebook, I have quite a few codes around this concept. Take a look in the \"hierarchies\" tab and see if any work for you. And please leave a note if they are closely connected to any of yours. \n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:27, topic:13988\"]\nWe have a story about living libraries, and we\u2019d like to code them under countering_exclusion -> learning/teaching pluralism -> living libraries. Does that sound ok?\n[/quote]\n\nYour codes shouldn't have these underscores -- just use a space. Also, are the arrows supposed to be designating hierarchies? Don't use hierarchies, just code the content with each of those codes. Then you will get a co-occurrence emerging in the graph. And feel free to then use them as categories in your own codebook, which we can then discuss later (see the wiki on hierarchies). \n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:27, topic:13988\"]\n* Jan and I think that having two codes positive_sentiment and negative_sentiment to code for positive feelings/attitude and negative feelings/attitude towards something respectively might be of use. Do you code for emotions? Does it make sense at all to put these into backend (I have my doubts since their proliferation may distort the SSNA graphical output, yet they seem to be ethnographically valuable). Please advise.\n[/quote]\n\nIf you look at my codebook, you can see that I have an entire category of codes with different emotions in them. If you are coding particular emotions that informants are expressing, feel free to use that emotion as a code. But \"positive\" and \"negative\" are too vague / non-semantic and don't belong in the SSNA. @hugi has a way of designating \"non-SSNA\" codes, but I'm not sure yet if we can implement it in POPREBEL. \n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:27, topic:13988\"]\nPolishness is described using various labels (provincial, religious, tolerant, etc.). How can we code a phenomenon that is being defined by means of listing its characteristics.\n[/quote]\nThat's an analytical/interpretive question that you and Jan need to try to approach using the codes! I personally would create a code `'Polishness'` (using the single quotes to denote an informant concept, see the wiki) and then co-code with the other concept labels that appear (so, `provincial` or `religious` ). Then you'll end up with a nice co-occurrence network of all the concepts that your informants associate with `'Polishness'` \n\nI'm happy to meet with you and @Jan, but you need to first engage properly with my codes and @Jirka_Kocian's codes (by using the comment function, as described in the wiki), and read the wiki in detail, because this will answer a lot of your questions and give us more specifics to talk about. So if you can commit to doing this before Thursday, we can talk then.

Though there weren't any human casualties, they've lost basic agricultural requirements, especially stored seeds. They have to start working from clearing the fields, making it reading for crops and then finding the seeds, all before monsoon. Your idea of involving the students sounds good.

Plus you're right in time for the July event - we're thinking sometime before mid month.\n\nRe: Urboteca, how do you see that you failed at your initial goals? From where I'm looking at, it seems you managed to get funding to map citizens' views on their neighborhoods in terms of access to and quality of green spaces, leisure spots etc and have built good collaborations. Great use of OSM by the way, I know a lot of Edgeryders folks use that too, for example to organise <a href=\"/t/openstreetmap-georgia/2989\">mapping parties</a>. Are there signs that people are using your maps or other eMedia tools?\n\nI know some people in Arcub are doing neighborhood or sectorial workshops too, as a way to consult citizens. But this goes nowhere near building empowerment, which unless it's a sustained effort feels like the hardest thing to do. What does it take for people at that scale to work together? With online networks for example, being awfully passionate matters A LOT, sometimes it simply does the trick because people come on board based on stuff they already care about. \u00a0Of course, you design with more things in mind, but curious what is the glue which can tie together people living on the same streets?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-18 12:16:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.380798", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 308, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4439, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4406, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi everyone, I have read some of the posts about the situation on the ground and calls for help.

Build an Edgeryders program to drive monetary and non-monetary resources to grassroots initiatives in Nepal</strong>. The initiative should strive to set the foundations for sustainable, long term collaborations beyond immediate Earthquake relief efforts. To do this we need a process by which new members from Nepal can present themselves, their work and what they need help with to the rest of the community in engaging ways that foster collaboration and mutual support (and skill development). Start with: Online Hangout.\n\n<strong>2. Communication and outreach.</strong> Developing creative ways to use our collective online presence to support the new program. Twitterstorms, daily count on me emails, and other formats we have developed over the years driven by a core team of people who each volunteer a bit of time to coordinate the work and help community members to know how they can help at any given time. Start: Online Hangout (do some homework e.g <a href=\"http://www.classy.org/blog/best-practices/resource-guides/\">Classy guidelines</a>)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-16 12:10:05", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 15:16:24.069521", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30951, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>tickets support ... </b>\n\n... yes the ticket situation is always challenging at the congress ...\n\nI've heard that also Maxime's friend got ill and did not come, but she has sold her ticket already...\n\nI was going to get one from someone at the venue, but I said that as I'm not arriving the first day he can offer it to someone else who needs it, but I mentioned I know of others who are still looking, so he might still get back to me.

From my perspective getting the raw-on-the-ground-info+emotion accessible is the main thing. I would also let them record in Nepali if that is significantly easier for them.\n\nYou could also use the soundcloud account I made (is good for 180 minutes). I'll send you the access info. It should be possible to link to a specific time from the ER platform.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-18 12:37:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.315118", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 211, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6258, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6225, "post_number": 1, "raw": "These are some notes of the call we have <strong>every two weeks</strong> with CCL (Oakland) and BioFoundry (Sydney) on <strong>Monday at 9am CET. Anyone is welcome to join in, just drop a line in this thread.</strong>\n\nCCL has done the last round of lab work for a while, due to holidays.\n\nThey have a mixture of protein attached to insulin &amp; gfp. When testing the mixture with gelelectrophoresis, they have one band (indication of the presence of a protein) that is the right size (40kDA) for the desired insulin-gfp-protein molecule, which is encouraging. However, they also have a band that is a bit shorter (30kDA).\n\nThey've been troubleshooting issues with the purification column. They want to research better ways for production now, so they will revise the construct for a better production process and higher yield. There are two new phd'ers on board who bring some fresh talent.\n\nWe (Belgium group) should get good yields of the gfp-insulin molecule a few days after we receive the shipment. The protocols have been thoroughly tested. CCL is\u00a0preparing for shipping &amp; sending over the protocols.\n\nRemark on the IP: as far as Anthony knows, it's more the formulation that's patented (eg. how they make long acting insulin), rather than the production method. They are using a vector\u00a0which might be protected (unsure) and the gfp might be as well. It's worth checking out, especially for the next steps.\n\nAnthony asked us to write a blog post to tell our story of why we participate, what we plan to do etc.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-17 20:40:03", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 14:19:35.462032", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40872, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 6856, "post_number": 29, "raw": "[quote=\"johncoate, post:8, topic:6856\"]\nnever mistake a clear vision for a short path\n[/quote]\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d805c5567488b94828ff74a529293d93b252371f.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">", "created_at": "2018-01-01 15:25:18.502062", "updated_at": "2018-01-01 15:25:18.502062", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [35111], "is_reply_to": [35111], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38933, "user_id": 4034, "topic_id": 7585, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Thx!", "created_at": "2017-10-31 21:15:29.843336", "updated_at": "2017-10-31 21:15:29.843336", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38847], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35015, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6808, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Ahlan Ahmed :slight_smile:\n\nWelcome to Edgeryders.

This is very close to my take. I think the most interesting avenue of inquiry here is going to be the anti-populist one: how do people cope with growing populist sentiments?

I'm interested in how people cope -- do they opt-out and create bubbles (therefore sheltering themselves from encountering difference, good or bad) or do they try and engage? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each? \n\nPersonally, I am more interested (because of the results so far) in exploring how people who are anti-populist are creating strategies to cope, fight, or deal with the rise of populism than understanding how populists think --  this is the way that the community is talking, at least, and I think it'll be interesting to follow their struggles. Though, of course, both are important, and other languages might yield the latter (understanding populist sentiment itself)-- I know @Jan is of course interested in this.

From what i encountered in Brussels, I would say there is a big difference between communities from different countries. For example, Moroccan and Turkish communities formed bubbles, then slowly opened up by the 2nd generation born here. Specifically in those communities there is a lot of friction between those who came here and 1st or 2nd generation born here. On one side you have their tradition (reinforced even after they came here as they maybe felt endangered and in culture chock) and on the other side you have the new generation, being torn between traditional upbringing and European culture and influence they naturally fall under.\nI feel like European immigrants more fall into the rich Brussels common melting pot of cultures :slight_smile: , expand views through exchange of ideas and experiences much faster. \n\nCould be wrong though, it's just how I see it, after 19 years in Brussels.", "created_at": "2020-02-13 16:37:00.002907", "updated_at": "2020-02-13 16:37:00.002907", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 229, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [70205], "is_reply_to": [70205], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29332, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>non-procedural question</b>\n\nIndependent of how the (admittedly rather embarrassing) discussion of how to appoint a director correctly will be solved, here's what I have to say about Patrick as part of Edgeryders LbG.\n\nBefore agreeing with Patrick to become a new director, I wanted an \"interview\" with him to see if he fits in.

It comes down to this: if you don't have a company but there is a project you want to do that requires an address, a VAT number, a bank account etc. talk to us, chances are you can do it using Edgeryders LBG (<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it/1044\">more details here</a>).\n\nSad to miss the chamber music, but I am <em>way</em> too far...\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 08:22:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.157469", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 320, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38949, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7602, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa0975ddf3f2f315ae7933de329fc56de422eeb9.png\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/51661da7c89807d191f536c7d966e69b0be738ef.png\" width=\"496\" height=\"556\">\n\n_Anique Yael Vered is Edgeryders's new research coordinator. Photo credit:_ @unknown_author\n\nOne thing we do at Edgeryders is research. We have to: we are trying to live by a book that no one has written, so we have to come up with it ourselves. People in the community are doing [biohacking](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hacking-and-making-care-whats-happening-with-openwetware-biohacking-and-diy-science-in-general/5616), [autonomous health care](https://edgeryders.eu/t/health-autonomy-at-the-end-of-the-world/6343), [network bartering](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-breakthrough-in-algorithm-development-for-network-barter/2160), [co-living](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spawning-the-reef-brussels-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239), [open source disaster response](https://edgeryders.eu/t/connecting-disaster-response-volunteers/7005), [permaculture](https://edgeryders.eu/t/crisis-what-crisis-the-journey-back-to-my-eco-roots/526), participatory and [citizen science](https://edgeryders.eu/t/citizen-science-water-microbial-analyses-personal-testing-for-dna-damage-and-art-for-public-understanding/830), civic hacking with [open data](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spaghetti-open-data-a-little-thing-that-feels-right/1281), [digital ethnography](https://edgeryders.eu/t/scaling-digital-ethnography-the-paper-is-out/6508), my own obsession [network science](https://edgeryders.eu/t/navigating-the-opencare-datascape-between-ethnography-and-network-science/7458), and much more. We do so often adopting [wildly interdisciplinary stances](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-counts-as-evidence-in-interdisciplinary-research-combining-anthropology-and-network-science-long/7160/3) \u2013  difficult, but potentially rewarding. Our dedication to [documentation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how/5222) of everything we do and commitment to openness and sharing knowledge makes it quite natural for us to be part of research efforts. We are just now concluding a large [EU-funded research project](https://opencare.cc), which was a very positive experience for all of us. It is clear that this community has incredible potential for research. At the same time, our efforts are often disorganised, disconnected, and they operate at too small a scale. Some of the potential gets lost.\n\nSo, here's the deal. We are setting up a business unit to develop research activities based on the community's skills and projects. Our vision is to connect the Edgeryders community's skills, activities and projects with the research community; to design together ambitious, high-impact research projects, fundraise around them, and execute them with the highest ethical standards. \n\nAs everything in Edgeryders, this \"business unit\" will actually be a network, and it will be led from the margins, not from the center. We invite those of you that feel close to the world of research to be nodes of that network. You may have projects, ideas, opportunities; we can bring to the table the Edgeryders corporate infrastructure and track record, and some proposal writing- and project management muscle. We also have ongoing deep collaboration with some of the best universities in the world.\n\nAs a first investment in the Edgeryders Research Network, we have hired someone. She will take the lead in mapping the community's strengths and interests to funding opportunities, and driving forward our effort to become a bottom-up research powerhouse. I am honoured to introduce you to **Anique Yael Vered, Edgeryders research coordinator.** \n\nAnique's background is diverse, like that of so many of us. But, in essence, she is a strategist. We believe she can lend coherence, vision and intelligence to our work, and are looking forward to working with her. Also, she has taken to Edgeryders with great enthusiasm: those of you that were at the Open Village Festival have already appreciated her team spirit and generosity.  The rest of you will no doubt have plenty of opportunities to get to know her.\n\nSo: if you have great ideas for research, you now have a natural ally in Anique. You can contact her [through the Edgeryders platform](https://edgeryders.eu/u/anique.yael) or by writing to anique [dot] yael [at] edgeryders [dot] eu. We set up [a workspace for the Edgeryders Research Network](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/edgeryders-research-network) on this platform, that you should also join if you want to be involved. That is where you are welcome to upload links, proposal, start discussions or whatever. It may look messy initially, but trust us \u2013 decentralised groups work, and we have many years of experience in building them and participating in them.

Join out get-together this afternoon?</b>\n\n<span>Hi </span><a href=\"/u/iuliansirbu\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">@IulianSirbu</a><span>,\u00a0</span>\n\nI really enjoyed your post and resonate with many of your views, especially with change coming from dissatisfaction.\u00a0\n\n<em><span>That is why EdgeRyders should know that this initiative to Spot The Future is really beneficial and there was a real need for it in Romania. I know there are more people of the sorts you are looking for but have not been brought together under the same entity in order to have a specific voice, to follow certain objectives to bring about genuine change.\u00a0</span></em>\n\n<span>I also believe that there's quite a few people in Romania working for change that do not know of each other nor of a platform that helps them connect to people doing the same in other parts of the world. Knowing that you're part of an international community of people building a different future can be incredibly motivating, plus concretely helpful - since sharing knowledge, practices and resources is what Edgeryders is about. From what you write, you seem to be quite a connector - I'm really curious about the people you'll bring onboard.</span>\n\n<em><span>It is challenging to be able to pay the bills and at the same time to show interest into creating a good habitat for future generations. The most important challenge I seem to face at the moment is a lack of call to action. A lot of talking, complaining, being disappointed in certain aspects of one`s life without taking matters into one`s hands. There is little protesting attitude, little self-development mood and energy and a high a sense of ridicule that seems to fade away as one heads west.\u00a0</span></em>\n\n<span>So, so true! When making end's meet takes up all of your time and energy and you sense no solidarity in your life/work, it might feel ridiculous to be called upon to have an impact on your community and to consider a greater, collective good. That's why the people &amp; initiatives that are working for change must connect, from a survival and snowball logic.\u00a0</span>\n\nI know it's short notice, but maybe you can join us this afternoon, <a href=\"/t/socializare-activa/4420\">here</a>?

I'd be uncomfortable with being unconsciously influenced for some \"higher purpose\" of emergence to happen.) It's also not an issue with all the special purpose communities out there from forums to crowdmapping to online dating, which all have very obvious means to guide behavior. So we know it influences our interactions, and we agree because we share the site's goal ...\n\nHowever if Alberto's idea of emergence design works, resulting in subtle influences that go unnoticed: Does it enable to design results-of-emergence that no single participant wanted to happen?

I would like to see a space that could support the exploration of non-rational (and yet physical) forms of problem solving. A here and now, somatic based platform as opposed to the globally distributed, electronic platform a lot of you are spending time to code. I want to get back to some basics in how we relate and potentially co-create or co-design amongst ourselves. I am interested in the wisdom our bodies and souls have to offer us, creating safe space for some vulnerability or accidental wisdom to appear. We're coming from so many different tangents, not to mention languages, that a space dedicated to researching and exploring what we have in common as human beings on our various learning journeys will be essential in getting a better 'sense' of who, we as 'edgeryders', are and then what we might be able to do with, or for, one other.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 It is so far a little overwhelming for me to try and grasp or meaningfully place myself within any one theme or track within this organisation.

The summary flyer btw is available already in 10 languages, but I would love to make more translations, and would also love more 'flags' to show up the site's counter...  I also want to point out to all the artistic people out there that the AGiR! Art Call is still open!!) \nOutside of these reflections, concretely, one project I hope to collaborate more upon in the future is to join in somehow for the open insulin project, most likely via Hackuarium and its newly inaugurated P1 lab.  \nI would also like to help find funding for us all to keep learning more and ultimately help make the world better...  (I finally filled in the form this morning...) \nTwo more things: I didn't see whether the info I sent before got linked into your list, but probably 1) including the prezi link (https://prezi.com/fbdthanaocd2/citizen-science/) would be good, as it includes the protocol for the quantitative micronucleus assays and microbio of envtal water samples, origami microscope, etc. at the end.  Also, 2) I encourage everyone who did bring home a foldscope to explore more via this site (https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/) especially checking out their 'usage tutorials' and trying to make more paper slides with tape and items of interest (insect wings etc)!

En effet, une\u00a0image va souvent plus loin que son seul aspect esth\u00e9tique, elle sert \u00e0 v\u00e9hiculer un message. A communiquer.\n\nThe Noun project est donc une grande biblioth\u00e8que de signes, pictogrammes, symboles, icones... en open data. La plateforme qui regroupe environ 500 symboles ou \"nouns\" permet en effet, en fonction de differentes licences, de r\u00e9utiliser et transformer des icones.\u00a0\n\nAu del\u00e0 de leur curation de pictogrammes, un autre aspects int\u00e9ressant du projet est que ces fondateurs organisent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des hackathons pour cr\u00e9er sur un th\u00e8me de nouvelles ic\u00f4nes et ainsi d\u00e9velopper et compl\u00e9ter leur base de donn\u00e9es. The noun project a r\u00e9cemment accueillit un \"Iconathon\" pour cr\u00e9er de nouveaux signes autour de la notion d'efficacit\u00e9 energ\u00e9tique, et de lumi\u00e8re LED.

But that guilt does not amount to thinking of one's own faults, rather a profound sense of loss. There have been reports of some Christian evangelists blaming gay people and other \"immoral\" activities for the earthquake, but these are rare and have slowed down after the backlash against the evangelists' initial position. Some Hindu activists also blamed all the animal sacrifice, some blamed the dearth of animal sacrifice. These, however, were positions too rare to find any traction among mainstream media or the general population. I haven't heard anything as ridiculous as Maulana Fazlur Rehman claiming women wearing jeans caused these earthquakes; I am glad he is not a Nepali citizen and influences almost none here.

The founders each pitch in with advice and revising the mission from time to time.\nIn its hardest period when people were considering whether or not to close it due to the risks involved, many supporters stepped forward and made contributions to keep the space running - because it was deemed as a valuable meeting point.\n\nThey do not want to receive any kind of funding in order to prove that an independent, fully community driven space can exist in Egypt.\n\nKudos @dina and others who were involved!

We decided not to pursue anything on our own, rather to \"hunt\" for the already forming consortia.\n\n**The approach we took:** \n\n1) **Linkedin campaign and 1:1 meetings**. @bojanbobic sent a large number of messages via @alberto's linkedin (the statistics coming up). To those than answered with interest to know more, he would send an e-mail putting me in cc and giving more info. I think there were more than 100. To those that replied and understood we are not building the proposal on our own, we proposed a meeting. Finally, I had around 8 meetings out of which 1 resulted in joining the consortium (IEECP) and another is likely (Emilia Romagna region) - the only ones who were actually coordinators of the proposal.\n\n2) we attended two **networking events** (one organized by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey and another by Climate KIC). During the first event I had seven 1:1 meetings, 1 resulted in joining the consortium (Sabanci University), two discussions are still ongoing but not putting a lot of faith into that considering it's quite late. After the C-KIC event I had 2 follow up meetings, contacts made by @amelia during the event (organizations also looking for consortia but valuable connections for future). @alberto from his side made a good contact with the Trinity College Dublin and this might result in joining the consortium. \n\n3) **responding to invitations**. We received a couple of invitations from our existing contacts, in this way we joined two consortia (C-KIC and Politecnico di Milano). This category also includes responding to the invitations via participants portal. Last month I registered our interest there and we received dozens of e-mails but from people looking for a consortium to join. Last year, this approach resulted in joining consortium for 2 projects (TREASURE and VOICE). This year no luck with that.\n\n4) **reaching out to personal contacts**. I reached out to a couple of my contacts (mostly in Croatia), had some meetings but no one is coordinating anything. To my knowledge, we didn't invest a lost of energy into this approach.\n\n**Conclusions from this experience:**\n\n- some negotiations are still ongoing, so don't want to jump into conclusions early, however I do want to share these reflections while the experience is still fresh. Statistically, this is not bad, we have a chance to conclude partnerships for **6 consortia in total**. But generally I think we can be smarter. \n\n- most of the people we reached out to through linkedin were in the exact same position as we were - looking for a consortium to join. as much as I don't mind meeting new people and making connections that might be useful for future, I felt I was wasting a lot of time in the moment we didn't have time to waste. Also I'm not sure it's good to have three persons involved in this. The people we contact see Alberto's message on Linkedin, then Bojan's e-mail then myself during the call. Finally they don't know who they are talking to and who is responsible for what + it's very difficult to follow all the e-mail flows and understand who has to respond. All in all, my view is: **I don't think we can \"dig\" the consortium leaders on linkedin.** \n\n- once we are in the call with the consortium leader, we get in. pitching our methodology is not that difficult, it's attractive and everyone wants it. So more 1:1 meetings with actual leaders are what we need.\n\n- networking events worked well. we should invest in those more. it allows us to actually identify the leaders and connect with them directly. \n\n- participants portal method can be kept (low effort) because we never know who can spot us there. \n\n- we should be reaching out more to personal contacts and partners in previous proposals. \n\n**What else can be done:** \n\n- [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/en). it's a valuable resource and previously we have been using it to find projects funded under similar calls. We would then reach out directly to the leaders asking if they are preparing anything new. Especially Universities are interesting here. It requires a bit more time, but compared to time used for Linkedin campaign I think it could be more valuable. \n\n- joining international networks. We have seen how the C-KIC platform can be helpful to connect with others. We should make us more visible and try finding and joining similar networks, such as [EBN](https://ebn.eu/).

If you would - it is likely you run into all sorts of negative unintended consequences. There's enough of those in the plain relief work already I'm afraid. I just wonder if this did receive much thought yet, and where I could read up on this.

Unfortunately some of us are brought up with the exact opposed mindsets. I believe in determinism, so that up to a certain point our actions are pre-determined by how we were socialized +brought up and our choices are restricted to a previously set array, give or take an amount of free will.\n\nAnd so my struggle is somehow the opposite of yours: I struggle to really find 1 passion, and to achieve stability (and a certain amount of money is a measure of that, but <em>not the driver</em>); to actually narrow down a multitude of potentially superficial interests for the sake of one true passion, something that I can really be good at and feel secure about. I'm not saying this is better or worse, I even find myself wanting to just be open and embrace every opportunity, but I easily get frustrated to start things that won't really get me anywhere, or just do them for the sake of novelty.\n\nHowever, I believe there can be a balance and that routine/stability/income generation don't always hinder us from keeping interests alive and being genuinely curious about life, and taking up hobbies etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you, particularly for reiterating what Edgeryders in the community have been saying so far: that PASSION really tops MONEY/JOB or whatever source of income.

This is understandable: coming up with a vision is hard enough without having to figure out the path to get there. However, it can trigger in the reader a sense of \"nah, that's not going to happen\". This is true especially for positive utopias: probably if we lived in one we would not be incentivized to break it, but we cannot see how to get from here to there. The utopia is a Nash equilibrium, but so is the world we live in. The utopia is a superior equilibrium, but we are stuck in this one. \n\n_Walkaway_ is an exception. A near future SF novel, it starts in a society we can completely recognize, give or take the robustness and commodification of some existing technologies (renewable energy production, self driving vehicles, 3D printing). We see the walkaway economy emerging in the course of the novel. Another exception is Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy; making a note of that here for future work in the reading group. \n\nThere are two steps to morphing a mainly default economy into a mainly walkaway economy: achieving critical mass and what happens at the tipping point. \n\n\n#### 1. Achieving critical mass in the walkaway economy\n\nThe walkaway economy would be a privately optimal choice (at least for some of us) if it were already there and we could just join it. When Iceweasel, Etcetera and Seth walk away, they find the Belt & Braces up and running and ready to take them in. Their necessities are met, and they can afford the luxury of figuring out where to go next. This is great, but how did it happen? The clearest explanation, I propose, is Jimmy's story in Chapter 4. I recommend reading it all, it is also moving from a literary point of view (you'll find it in section XVII, location 6055 on Kindle).\n\n>\"What made you walk away, Jimmy?\"\n\n>\"It was debt at first.\" [...]  \u201cMom and Dad were all over the idea of me going to uni. They\u2019d both gotten degrees and swore it had been worth it, though they would owe money until they died, and neither one had ever held a job for more than a couple years. I once overheard them talking about how fucked it would be if I didn\u2019t get a good job because neither of them had a pension and they\u2019d need me to feed them once they were too old to get another job after the next layoff. \n\u201cThe pressure was crazy. On the boards, people were saying, hey you assholes, you keep bitching about how everything is fucked up and shit, and there you are, getting ready to play along with it like good debt-slaves. Everyone knows there\u2019s an alternative.\u201d \n\n>\u201cThat\u2019d be us,\u201d Etcetera said. \n\n>\u201cThat\u2019d be you.\"\n\nA particularly sinister thing is that Jimmy's school is pushing student's hard to choose expensive education options that push you into debt. The school has an app, supposed to give advice to students about their optimal choice of career, and:\n\n> They could only keep their charter if they ran a certain percentage of students through it and they followed its advice. So once you got your career picked by the thing, that was it. Every teacher and administrator knew their paychecks depended on you doing what it told you.\n\nI can totally see this. A consortium of powerful private universities providing funding for schools, then threatening to withdraw it if they don't send paying customers their way. Or, even better, lobbying for regulation that requires schools to provide a certain number of students to the \"universities of excellence\". Apps like the one described [already exist](https://appolicious.com/these-mobile-apps-help-students-pick-colleges-and-majors/). \n\nDebt has been the main mechanism pushing people out of society for five thousand years. In [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) David Graeber describes the macrocycle that underpinned the societies of Babylonian city-states: people would get in debt in years of bad crop. So they would borrow money, putting up as collateral their fields, then their houses, then their children, then their wives, then themselves. And then many would flee before the creditor could claim them as property, joining gangs of armed nomadic pastoralists that threatened society. At this point, the king would declare all private debt null and void (\"blank slates\"), debtors would be reunited with their families and return to their homes, and a new cycle would start. \n\n\n#### 2. Going mainstream: the tipping point in the walkaway economy\n\nThe process of growth of the walkaway society is nonlinear. Like most diffusion processes, it seems roughly logistic: a long period of slow growth, then a dramatic acceleration when almost everyone adopts it, then a slow process of decay of the last remaining default strongholds. The period of dramatic acceleration seems to be pushed by three factors.\n\n* The walkaway society (with its underpinning economy) has reached an attractive scale. This is shown in Chapter 6. Walkaways are reclaiming cities drowned by climate change or extreme pollution, turning them into viable habitats for people \"for whom society has no use\". They are very well organized: they have solarpunk transport systems like slow trains, zeppelins, and ultra-ultralight bicycles. They have house AIs and consciousness upload. \n* Default society is becoming ever more harsh, with more extreme inequality and fewer opportunities for the rest of us. Nadie:\n\n> \"There isn\u2019t going to be default world and walkaway world trading people forever. When you have big rich people, and everyone else poor as poor, the result is \u2026 unstable.\"\n\n* Slow growth has reached the point where almost everyone has close friends or relatives in walkaway. At this point, network effects kick in, making it much easier for people to walk away than it had been for Jimmy. We see this happening in real time at the confrontation between default security and the freed inmates at Kingston prison, in Chapter 6:\n\n> It turned on graph theory: once you hit a critical mass of walkaways, the six-degrees thing meant every single rent-a-cop on the line was no more than two handshakes\u2014or family Christmas dinners\u2014away from a walkaway who would shame and sweet-talk them into putting down their weapons.\n\n\"The six-degrees thing\" refers to [Stanley Milgram's small world experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment), a landmark result in network science. Political scientist Michael Chwe has a more formal treatment of how social network structure influences the possibility of successful collective action in [this paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/210269) (recommended).", "created_at": "2018-07-19 08:53:24.770474", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 01:10:45.046145", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1157, "wiki": false, "reads": 42, "score": 1583.4, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 1935, 3067, 2095, 4196], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79393, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13448, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Natalia hi, sorry to have missed this post - so much going on here.

Issue raised by Alberto, following [this event ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414): how does \u201cthe POPREBEL community\u201d learn about stuff that lives in Campfire? How do we get it to reconnect the issue back to populism, or at least populist governments?\n[/quote]\n\n- Noemi pointed out that the POPREBEL community is fragmented, because of the topics but also the languages. \n- we could do some narrative spinning such as use blogging (to get different points of view) or have a more active group of community managers working across projects and making posts in different languages. For now this can be done in English and Czech.\n- the issue raised by Maria is that when posting topics in different categories, for example Campfire, the traffic is different and people interact more or less depending on the category in which the post is. We don't have the data for this.\n- the upcoming events such as the one about [the future of coworking](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-support-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-an-online-summit-bringing-together-key-industry-figures-and-wider-sector-participants/13987) will be used to create links to what people really care about and initiate conversations about the role of governments and the policies.

In that case, when the width setting exceeds the visible width, the image width alone will be scaled down and it will appear stretched. To fix it, just double-click the photo in the editor, set \"width\" to \"100%\" (or another percentage value of you like) and \"height\" to nothing. Just do it for every photo you insert and you'll be fine. The other two in your article had the right settings already \u2026\n\nOn another note, I tried to harmonize typography in the interviews we do for our Future Makers Nepal project.

They would mess up how your text appears later, even though you don't see all of them in the editor.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-18 17:54:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.548009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 256, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10579], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13719, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4548, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks @Matthias, I noticed</b>\n\nThanks @Matthias and sorry for disturbing, I noticed you were online and that's why I asked you about the photo as both me and @AnushBabajanyan were trying to fix it in vain for some time already and I did not know who else could help.\n\nI will adhere to the typography rules you have for Future Makers Nepal.

The idea came in winter, mid February. The improuvement of park has been chosen for it's apolitical content, for the sake of uniting citizens under good social cause and for renovation/restoration of the relax zone of the park. The problem was that the city of the several dozen citizens didn't have a park and were needed to drive to a nearby city - Kramatorsk. In Slaviyansk the park was flooded by bad drainage system, and this problem created big corruptive schemes, since every next deputy to the city council was promising to restore it and there were couple of million given for it's restoration, but after 15 years the situation hasn't changed.\u00a0\n\nProject included 8 \"Subbotniki\" - clean-up events with ordinary people helping restore roads, planting flowers etc. The largest amount of comers were\u00a0360 people. Organizers were successful in inviting also representatives of the executive power and some entrepreneurs for potential creation of the free economic zone (renting space for looking after it's small piece of land).\u00a0\n\nThe first big result was celebration of the victory day not on the main street but in the restored central alleys of the park. \u00a0The biggest problem of flooding will be eliminated after the conclusion of the special commission on all of the damages and needed equipment. The project will continue up until all problems will be solved. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-16 22:25:15", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 16:03:19.307397", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 419, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84773, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 147, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:139, topic:13292\"]\nI\u2019ve started reading Imperium, a historical fiction biography of Cicero.\n[/quote]\n\nThis looks really nice!

The best part is the motivation of the Finnish government decades ago to move towards establishing teaching as highly-skilled and well-paid job: they knew they are far behind other thriving economies, as a rural country, and they knew that educating on the highest possible level every single kid will create essential assets to become what Finland is now. Known for its innovative and progressive society.\n\nI have observed a couple of extreme flaws and issues in the educational system in Nepal. You know of them even better - terrible conditions in which children are learning, poorly paid and ill-prepared teachers, and this incredible competition between public and private sector, which only strengthens social divisions and creates revenue that goes straight to the pockets of rich foreigners. Lack of a curriculum is yet another one.\n\nNow, as the country will be soon going through major changes in terms of political situation (if we are to believe the promises of the 4 major parties - and if we take into account strange but interesting reasons for their fast-track constitution procedure, it seems to be really happening), is there a group of people who could organise and influence the shape of educational system? Are teachers unionized, or - if not - mobilised and aware enough to take a lead?

We have utilized your proposals as detailed below, and a new version (let's say a first beta release) is available now ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHIHs6QL9ZLh3cV0k6etmf9PDmaZZKvx9Y9Z_B7yZFQ/edit#gid=784954257)).\n\nI have a few \"internal standards\" when I develop spreadsheet templates (or templates in general), and you seem to have different ones, but that's fine. For clarification, mine include: (1) A template should rather include too much than too little functionality, as long as it's simple to remove what is not needed in each application case, (2) it's _almost_ never a good idea to mix records of different types in one table (\"budget items and expenses\", \"config variables and revenues\"), sheets should be treated like SQL tables with a well-defined record structure, (3) data should be structured in such a way that formulas can apply to it with as few exceptions needed as possible, (4) formulas have to be understandable without much work (esp. difficult as no comments are possible), so if needed use intermediate columns and tables.\n\nSo in effect, what we did with your proposals:\n\n1. Yes, subtotals based on budget item number was a bad idea, not implemented (formulas get too complex). Current simple `SUM(\u2026)` mechanism has to be improved as well though, as it easily breaks when adding rows at the edges of the formula's range and forgetting to adapt the formula. We kept the budget item number column and unit / unit cost columns though, as they can be easily removed when not needed.\n\n2. We kept the Cash Journal sheet (now \"Expenses\"), but yes, three dates were overkill. One date now.\n\n3. Predicted money in got now its own sheet. Seemed the cleanest solution.\n\n4. \"Paid\" checkbox is still there, but not used yet. The idea is that for projects we don't have a bank account balance from which to start a cash flow prediction, so instead everything \"paid\" would be summed up to make that balance. Maybe there is a better idea to the same effect.\n\n5. The form filling is mostly because (as discussed with @noemi) we're also trying to replace the project journals with these spreadsheets, aggregated together in a sheet of the company-wide Magic Spreadsheet. Replaced \"description\" with a field to enter a URL with a platform reference, though.\n\n6.

You aren't 'thick' in my opinion, and obviously I should be able to make a more coherent story for you (all). Indeed with the microbio 'plating' methods, we only can count the bugs that grow under the given conditions of nutrients and temperature and oxygen and pH etc...  This is why we try to talk about 'colony forming units' in the stricter analyses. Never are we able to get a number of everything that was in our original water sample...  Another project from Hackuarium, the Water Drop DNA project (that has the 'explorer' Mike Horn as a sponsor!) does try to find out all the things in a water sample -through DNA analyses - but that method doesn't give a real number of how many of each bug is represented in the sample (and can also include things that aren't even alive!) ! \nI don't think, however, that there are any p-value probabilities on the sheet. Just the counts (usually gross estimates) and one average and standard deviation (that shows the variance) for the one sampling site for which we had 3 plates...  \nHowever, I will try attach a graph that shows 95%-iles for some similar analyses...  \nIt is very worth talking about this though, because what the probability shows is only valid in comparison to the controls.  You start out with the so called 'null hypothesis' (i.e. there is no difference in bacterial abundance between sampling sites and tap water) and if the P value when you compare the averages is very low, that means you can reject this null hypothesis, and say there is indeed a significant difference in bacterial abundance between sampling sites from these data.\nSo from the example graph, that I need to upload next, where these 95%iles all overlap, there is no significant difference in bacterial abundance, but (usually the rule of thumb is that significant diffs should be at least 2standard deviations away from each other - we can talk about normal error bars another time, if you want! :wink: ) the parts with a big peak not overlapping with others does differ significantly - at least statistically.\nWhich leads me to the next point:\nThe really crazy thing that is hard for people to grasp is that, even if your p<<0.01, there would still be a 1% chance that the difference you observed with your data *is* simply due to chance.  \nyep.\nThis is why there is a re-thinking of many old data based only on p=0.05 with low n numbers (this is why using 5 plates would be better than 3 plates, too, if you can manage it, to provide a concrete example of how to try to get around these problems).  \nThis is also why really using the 'control data' is important! \nIn our case, we can ask, for instance, how many times does the tap water give no bacteria? In fact, we were basically really screwed because we had tons of colonies even from the tap water samples, and should have included non-inoculated plates in the DIY (box in the bathtub!) incubation!  :joy:\nThere is a great quote I will find about this to include too!  \nok, got, it - I actually took it from George Elliot's book Daniel Deronda, but says that in Aristotle's 'poetics' he wrote (also quoting someone else!):\n''This too is probable, according to that saying of Agathon: 'It is a part of probability that many improbable things will happen.' ''\n\nJust to re-iterate in terms of probabilities: the P value shows the probability that what you observe could have happened simply due to chance.  If P values are low enough, you are allowed to reject that null hypothesis and say there does seem to be a real difference between the different samples.  However, there is still another important issue: this whole exercise never 'proves' anything, in the way you can have some mathematical proof, or the way the media says - this study proves xyz!\nnever!\nIn fact, the true scientific method can only 'disprove' something (i.e. to say, these are not the same!)! \n& a new experiment with better controls and more statistical power can sometimes turn all beliefs upside down.\nI love the idea that in the last decade so many things are being realised as quite important - microbes are part of us (10^14 of them vs 10^13 of 'ourselves'), our neurons aren't forever and 'baby' ones come into our brains from stem cells, DNA is repaired (but better to avoid damage, still) - these are just 3 things that are game changers.\nI started my serious academic work, working with retroviruses, that showed that an old dogma of molecular biology (DNA->RNA->protein) is wrong - RNA->DNA too!  And now with microRNAs, and more (RNA helping repair DNA), the RNA life hypothesis isn't just for explaining evolution, but is an important current thing in all living cells - crucial in my ideas about dynamic genomic integrity.  \nBut I will try to get back to the point (though I could go on and on, and would love to hear other's ideas and thoughts!!)! \nI am sorry that because of our weak data, with smears and few replicates, we can't say there is a real difference in bacterial populations from our water sampling!  \nStill, nonetheless, I am convinced that we had one good result - no E.coli observed in the tap water samples - so little likelihood that raw sewage was there, unlike for the Leopold park samples...  \nhip hip hooray! ?? :confounded:\nI got a little deeper into statistics a couple of years ago in a MOOC course, and know that we would all benefit from more awareness of these issues.\n\nHope you have a great weekend!\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52c2c22752f2ad899f02192eeb635f7cca5b8f54.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"582\">", "created_at": "2017-11-04 06:39:48.459722", "updated_at": "2017-11-04 06:39:48.459722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 981, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 77.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38999], "is_liked_by": [3362, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87307, "user_id": 6670, "topic_id": 14492, "post_number": 71, "raw": "hello, \n\ncould i ask you to embed this [video](https://vimeo.com/manage/481641392/general) in this [tell.form](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14783), please?", "created_at": "2020-11-20 11:39:15.186230", "updated_at": "2020-11-20 11:39:15.186230", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86551], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12877, "user_id": 2736, "topic_id": 4570, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Pressure Cooker's blowing up &amp; Material </b>\n\nThere has been death by blowing up pressure cooker in some location of third world country.

We are continuously doing experimental work in the form of projects and ventures imagined and deployed by different constellations of individuals and organisations. Many are ephemeral collaborations that dissolve once the goals are met. Over time relationships form between people and organisations who choose to continue working with one another towards a shared vision. They become clusters.\n\n**How is this different from a network?**  In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a system, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants. If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies. If you are a social cooperative, you must look away from providing standardized services to customizing what you do in order to better valorize the capabilities of the people they are assisting.

I am also not used to talking to people via a forum, this is the first time actually. It is different, everything open, I jave to adjust to it. I like the etiquette of email and face-to-face talks and forum are...well, different, people are more straight-forward it seems :)\n\nYou are right in what you say, I definitely see your point. It is hard to grow and we struggle with it, I had a more or less failed attempt with another network that I was engaged it before, but, you know, my conclusion is a bit different. High number does not necessarily mean higher payoffs for everyone, it depends on what the network is focusing on and what type of communication method it uses. I think that that what is needed is to grow at a rate that allows the network to keep/develop also a certain ethos that it would like to uphold and also a form of responsibility and respect towards the different roles and capacities that each member has. Professional development of a network is serious work.\n\nOur network is only developing now and it is exactly because we wanted to be more of a working-together network, and not a sharing-ideas-only type of network, it takes a lot of time and invisible work to see the number of members growing. Also, the very idea of what we would call the network to be formed of is changing. What it does not change is the mission and the type of interaction we want to have: content-based, doing things together, not only communication and sharing of ideas, because I have noticed that people tend to stick to one-another more if they have done something together, be it an event, a training, a press-conference or more complex work. Also, what I love to see is people starting to collaborate outside the network based on their shared experience that we facilitated. That is just amazing when it happens.\n\nSome good projects of research into networks and coalitions are taking place in Romania these days and some large-scale NGOs are preparing a resource center for networks and coalitions, trainings for communication, advocacy, community engagement, management etc. We hope to join as well with our baby network and train people to be better at promoting culture in education practices and practitioners.\n\nI will write here from time to time, if you are curious, to tell you how it goes.\u00a0\n\nRaluca\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-29 16:52:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.072034", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 469, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19550], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19575, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4571, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Same thing here</b>\n\nAha, I get it.

Then you find out through you day to day experiences that there are individuals around you who struggle for this basic resource. And that is when things change, it becomes personal for me, it becomes real, not just some media reports or some clicks on you facebook page. I guess it's a mix of my own understanding of life, of our society and the way it works, a strong sense of compassion and the will to change things. That is why I focus allot on activating people and empowering them to struggle for the cause they most believe in.

Momentan, din cate stiu sau cel putin in experienta mea, programele de voluntariat promovate in prezent in scoli se limiteaza la o strangere de haine si jucarii pe an si eventual la diferite evenimente de Craciun sau alte sarbatori organizate pentru diverse orfelinate.\n\nMereu m-am gandit ca am putea face mai mult, ca am putea avea programe mai sustenabile care sa ajute acesti copii sa se dezvolte altfel pe termen lung. Mai mult decat atat, mereu am vazut elevi dornici sa se implice mai mult, dar care nu ar face neaparat pasul urmator fara putin ajutor, fara un extra impuls. Cred ca voluntariatul e mult prea putin promovat in directia aceasta, si cred mult ca ar exista o deschidere enorma. Pe langa potentialul enorm de a aduna multi oameni, ar putea avea un efect benefic si asupra elevilor, in sensul ca i-ar putea responsabiliza trecand prin niste experiente mai diverse.\n\nPoate apucam sa dezbatem mai pe indelete saptamana asta, as fi interesata sa vad ce credeti voi despre asta!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-07 14:05:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.619175", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 258, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7973, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4584, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Quality control?</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/iarina_stefanescu\">@Iarina_Stefanescu</a>\u00a0ma bucur sa te citesc!

Founded in 2006, it is the oldest Spanish NGO devoted to the promotion of (e)Participation. Pedro is responsible for creating a virtual system for municipal citizen participation, suited for developed, as well as developing countries.\n\nHe created a model that provides citizens and politicians tools promoting a stronger citizen incidence at the municipal level, which is where the interaction representative-represented is easier and closer. Pedro realized there is a need for new tools and methods which enhance the ability of citizens and politicians to work together in solving their daily problems, and thus promote a renewal of politics. A true democracy needs to be guided by an intense and constant dialogue between politicians and the citizens.\n\nPedro saw he needed to move further from the dualism expressed in the \"top-down\"/ \"bottom-up\" opposition, and go in the direction of a \"kaleidoscopic governance\", with multiple actors and stakeholders involved. Pedro realized that the requirements needed to support participation... just started to converge.\n\n<strong>Read more about Pedro</strong>\n\n\u2015Creation of Kyopol system <a href=\"/t/creation-of-kyopol-system-aka-symbiotic-city-the-internet-as-a-catalyst-for-civic-engagement-and-citizens-activation-ckyosei-org/1235\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/creation-kyopol-system-aka-symbiotic-city-internet-catalyst-civic-engag</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-05 16:09:13", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:38:55.864848", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 354, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41118, "user_id": 4085, "topic_id": 7961, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Amazing place !

You can find a form for regular moneyless support payments to one or several recipients. Recipients are other users on the Makerfox platform. Entering multiple at once (like your group of favourite open hardware projects) is preferred, as then the algorithm can decide who gets what part of the support. This helps the algorithm to catalyse more network barter deals, and also results in yourself getting more deals. Your support payments are executed as parts of regular network barter deals that include products and services \u2013 for example, when you have to give stuff for 30 EUR away in a deal, while getting stuff for 60 EUR, the 30 EUR \"profit\" would come from receiving payments (donations or \"regular\" moneyless payments). For sending donations / payments, the numbers would be the other way round. Makes sense?\n\n'Nough said :) We should now care about publicity rather than tech, and I guess the \"donations\" feature can help with that.

[These activities against the hydropower plants](https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/16/villagers-in-serbia-tear-out-hydropower-pipes-in-protest-over-river) actually motivated young people to start returning to the areas which have been completely abandoned. In the village of Topli Do in the Stara Planina mountain, the members of the local community and our activists physically clashed with the developer having no other resort and attracted nation-wide attention. I couldn\u2019t imagine, in my wildest dreams, that a God-forsaken village of some twenty people would be visited by Manu Chao. And yet it happened. The result? With young people returning and more activist visitors coming for pilgrimage, they started growing more vegetables and doubled the meat production.\n\n![|624x351](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Hb9uytZTPLUkOgqqVjZMluv_A0m7QB7NqRRIoqOtLviuO4hGKmZq2ROuhOguPtemzKWA5lrC_PBRPRWYx_H2QBEhl62-xzFwvCSCis2tpV3E_HB7vyT4Nk-_l21uDcOv_boaGbyT)\n*Breathtaking landscape of the pristine old-growth forest in Stara Planina, the largest continuous evergreen forest in the Balkans. Protected nature area. No human meddling allowed.*\n\nI live in Belgrade but was born in Pirot, a town of 50,000 people close to the Bulgarian border - in the Stara Planina area. I\u2019m a local patriot, my family and I spend every summer there, it\u2019s much more liveable and relaxed. And this year, many more people started visiting this area because of the positive attention we made and the Covid-19 pandemics, buying local produce, for example the famous sheep cheese, and they sold it out by the end of August, even normally their stocks last until the start of the new season in April next year! So, **the economical logic will lead the farmers to produce more and this is a wonderful example of synergy between seemingly unconnected phenomena: opposition to devastation of nature led to increased local production.** This attraction made a huge dent in this big wall of misunderstanding and prejudices... It was our luck, but the case is exemplary: if people come, they will have to sleep, spend time and eat\u2026 Local products.\n\n![|623.8064114461018x352.69058150520306](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/69MKo5V55UV6Ty351M7Ep_5yqhQnbcGtcq6xQzs7GcR8yuWCkgpBsSa3dVuLjLVleNKyhfSb0Xj6d2PIj8DnJD_ePMAiHNhQxlY8JUigN7DR_LoJ9ude5VZBWuXmA0kExhStZWhF)\n*This is Dragan, my namesake living in the village of Topli Do, Southeast Serbia. On 7 October 2019, he was injured in a fight with the security staff of the SHPP developer.*\n\nThe law enforcement forces didn\u2019t intervene in this issue with the developer. The police constables are locals, they have to come and confront people who speak their own dialect, to face them tomorrow in the village or the town. So they refrain from intervention.\n\nThe bigger issue is that a conscientious environmental inspector makes the right decision, sues a developer, but some unknown hand at a court puts the suit somewhere on the shelf and waits until the case becomes obsolete due to lapse of time.\n\n### Whether it be agriculture or small hydropower plants, the big players are always connected with government structures in some way.\n\nMost subsidies go to large-scale farmers, because they know how to ask for it. It is a tremendous task for us to do much footwork, visit many, many villages, talk to the locals and convince the government to change the policies, volens-nolens.\n\nIt is hard but true that small villages can feed the seven-million population of Serbia. If the people feel the taste of the local food, when they go home they are more likely to stop buying in the big markets and nearly everyone would benefit. Just the big players would be unhappy. That\u2019s the key. Here in Belgrade I have a few farmers I trust, I have their numbers and I call them to order their produce. Word of mouth is a very important way for messages to come across, and I want to believe it\u2019s possible.\n\nOn a global level, bailouts and subsidies can\u2019t go on for long. No one is too big to fail, but many are too big to bail. The present situation is not unlike the Roman empire before its collapse. The rot is there, you don\u2019t see it, it will take a few generations but it is there, and the calamity is waiting to happen.\n\nIn two villages we have young men being the heads of local government. We are planning to make a research and education centre in the Stara Planina mountain without any assistance from the state. If you depend on the state, the state will expect some payback from you. Imagine this: when our activists came to the village to talk with the members of the local community, people - as much as fifty of them - started coming dressed in white shirts, like going to a village feat. **It was the first time somebody came and told the people what they want to do in their village. Empathy is the key for everything.**\n\nThis is the key to approach local producers, to make them susceptible to your message, and convince them to stop using pesticides. In some areas, they are famous for local potatoes because they are not pestered by the Colorado beetle as it can\u2019t live at high altitudes and one doesn\u2019t have to spray the potato. You can tell them: people, you don\u2019t have to spray, you can fertilise naturally as you have sheep and goats and huge heaps of manure laying around. It will need a bit more of manual labour, but it won\u2019t harm you. They are smart people and they started sending their produce with courier services all across Serbia.\n\n![|526.2788085668823x255.99999999999906](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yiHL4DyqqGWNDjZn2uNZog8u0GvUBACsGv7C4J9A6YUjXVYgcgb4wSF07OZPeeRGMRdfOGFQt5p4YGTbzy1oWzdJS-ILXgoAgv3eHGFvg0aUsTP9f0JiTmaJvK6bXju7ixVx2CHc)\n*Locally produced cheese, delivered by courier service*\n\n![|624x351](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RV2bUBwmo0suJpgKY0Uu9qHEURBXMmiqTBslEeMyfayAQRWjcvr0HRtJCaogad_VOk1mDxa9ECaEGO9H2zfrz0m5SrM7H3GsuRRMACnbHY6rorJhBTaoxbd4Nq-ZUzkrLZwyR_ai)\n*This is a thriving herb patch. No spraying, no fertilisers, just compost. I call it \u201casylum for endangered insects\u201d. One day, I counted six different pollinators rarely seen elsewhere.*\n\n### If you attract enough people to come and visit you, they will have to buy something and then they will continue to buy from you even when they go home.\n\n*A few words about me. I have a full-time job (a one-man company), but I think, I live, and I breathe environmental activism. Together with my family. My big worry at the moment is that Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian mining company, recently started plans to mine precious lithium ore in Serbia. You know, lithium as in lithium batteries in your mobile phones. Manufacture of one kilogramme of lithium-carbonate needs 23,300 litres of water, which is afterwards returned to the waterways, polluting and poisoning them. But it\u2019s a path of devastation and immense, awful pollution. If it happens, half of the nation will be poisoned in this or that manner. And it is not going to happen, if it needs force, so be it. In our activist network, everyone has a lawyer available around the clock. I am not afraid of being arrested, not me, not anybody. I\u2019m telling this jokingly, don\u2019t take it literally: it\u2019s not a bad idea to introduce an \u2018\u2019eco-shariat\u2019\u2019 to punish people who overuse pesticides.

Marketing\u2019s shared history with the consumerist culture, the controversies on business responsibility and the downfall of counterforces that are national states and social institutions in the context of globalization, contributed to blur the limits of ethic in marketing practices. While limits thin down, marketing practices found new fields of technical improvement through the development of behavioral sciences, constitutive of a psychopower, immoderately use to tend toward ubiquity; not only aiming direct sells anymore but also working on the symbolic level for the sake of branding.

Therefore, a strong consideration is required to provide accessible infrastructures for the disabled population and give them a sense of independent survival. The new structures especially the public and government buildings need to be accessible for all irrespective of any disabilities. Another important factor are the roads and the pavements which I have noticed are not at all wheelchair accessible and most government buildings have similar situations as well. Besides the physical structures the information technology services provided by the government agencies as well as the private and public sectors also lack to provide such accessibility features. American Disability Act (ADA) and European Standard designed by ETSI for procurement of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) provide guidelines to obtain accessible technologies. Therefore, the procurement, rebuilding and development processes must incorporate accessibility features in planning, designing and building physical structures as well as ICT infrastructures which can ensure equal participation from all the citizens and also emphasizes safety for all, even under natural calamities like the one we have faced recently.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-15 15:57:35", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:41:00.118939", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 219, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2554], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19097, "user_id": 700, "topic_id": 1458, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Hello Matthias,\n\nwith the</b>\n\nHello Matthias,\n\n\u00a0\n\nwith the following words you got the point.\n\n<font color=\"#736357\">\"But if we are supposed to be in a lab setting for scientific observation, it would be better to introduce people right away to that idea when they sign up (just \"used for research\" is quite vague).\"</font>\n\n<span>I'll try and explain what I mean.</span>\n\n<span>I don't want to revolutionize Edgeryders because it's doing the right job and I didn't know that my mission could be taken so seriously.</span>\n\n<span>I see Facebook and Google and I only imagine what they do with our data.

Looking into the future you can join the shared webinar with DeLab here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world-applying-collective-intelligence-to-big-data-3rd-of-june/13537 to have a concrete conversation with data scientists on how to interpret data.\n3.

So what would our equivalent be?\n* My suggestion is that the forms ought to be published first in a closed category to which only community managers and event organisers have access. \n* The admins and organisers can then review the submissions and where needed verify the information submitted is accurate - that links work etc.", "created_at": "2020-06-02 21:30:05.514668", "updated_at": "2020-06-02 21:35:36.249996", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 281, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [78038], "is_reply_to": [78038], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27698, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2931, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Armenian Translation</b>\n\n<em>\u0544\u056b \u0576\u0578\u0580 \u0561\u0577\u056d\u0561\u0580\u0570 \u0567 \u056f\u0565\u0580\u057f\u057e\u0578\u0582\u0574` \u0563\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0577\u056d\u0578\u0572 \u0570\u0561\u057d\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b\u0581 \u0564\u0578\u0582\u0580\u057d \u0561\u057a\u0580\u0578\u0572 \u0574\u0561\u0580\u0564\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0581 \u0571\u0565\u057c\u0584\u0565\u0580\u0578\u057e</em>\n\n<em>\"\u0546\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0576\u0577\u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0531\u057a\u0561\u0563\u0561\"-\u0576 \u0574\u056b\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0567 \u0563\u056c\u056d\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580 \u0570\u0565\u0580\u0578\u057d\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0576` \u056b\u0580\u0565\u0576\u0581 \u0570\u0561\u0574\u0561\u056f\u056b\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0570\u0565\u057f</em>\n\n<em>\u0535\u0563\u056b\u057a\u057f\u0578\u057d - \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 - \u054e\u0580\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u00a0</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\u0561\u056f\u057f\u056b\u057e\u056b\u057d\u057f\u0576\u0565\u0580</em>\n\n<em>\u0570\u0561\u0584\u0565\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580</em>\n\n<em>\u057d\u0578\u0581\u056b\u0561\u056c\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0576\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580</em>\n\n<em>\u0561\u0580\u057e\u0565\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0563\u0565\u057f\u0576\u0565\u0580</em>\n\n<em>\u0563\u056b\u057f\u0576\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580</em>\n\n<em>\u056f\u0578\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b\u056f\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\u0544\u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0562\u0578\u056c\u0578\u0580\u057d \u0561\u0575\u057d\u057f\u0565\u0572 \u0561\u057c\u0561\u057b\u0561\u0580\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0574\u0565\u0580 \u056a\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0561\u056f\u0568, \u0563\u056b\u057f\u0565\u056c\u056b\u0584\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0568, \u0570\u0574\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0576 \u0578\u0582 \u0574\u056b\u0574\u0575\u0561\u0576\u0581 \u0585\u0563\u0576\u0565\u056c\u0578\u0582 \u057a\u0561\u057f\u0580\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0568:</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\u053b\u0576\u0579 \u0565\u0584 \u0564\u0578\u0582\u0584 \u057d\u057f\u0565\u0572\u056e\u0578\u0582\u0574?</em>\n\n<em>\u053b\u0576\u0579\u056b\u0576 \u0565\u0584 \u0564\u0578\u0582\u0584 \u0564\u0565\u0574?</em>\n\n<em>\u053b\u0576\u0579\u057a\u0565\u057d \u056f\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0572 \u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0574\u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0574\u056b\u0561\u057d\u056b\u0576 \u0561\u0577\u056d\u0561\u057f\u0565\u056c?</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\u0540\u0561\u0574\u0565\u0581\u0565\u0584, \u056f\u056b\u057d\u057e\u0565\u0584 \u0574\u0565\u0566 \u0570\u0565\u057f:</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>\u0531\u057a\u0561\u0563\u0561\u0576 \u0546\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0576\u0577\u0578\u0572\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0544\u056b\u057b\u0561\u0566\u0563\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0540\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0575\u0576\u0584\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0540\u0561\u0576\u0564\u056b\u057a\u0578\u0582\u0574,</em>\n\n<em>\u0540\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b\u057d\u056b 25-28-\u0568, \u0539\u0562\u056b\u056c\u056b\u057d\u056b, \u054e\u0580\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-08 10:27:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.851730", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 158, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26728], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30660, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 1206, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Hi there,\n\ngood work everyone this sounds very interesting indeed.\n\nHere are a group of biogas inventors on fb:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/methanogens/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/methanogens/</a>\n\nThey may be able to help you in your work.

Open Source Optical Coffee Sorter\n\nTowards a bigger vision of fair and direct international food trade, we are looking to develop coffee processing tools for small coffee farmers that allow them to earn a much better income by selling the finished coffee product directly to the final consumers. The first tool is a low-cost optical coffee sorter: a small machine that improves coffee quality by sorting out the \u201cbad beans\u201d at a rate of \u2265100 kg per day.\n\n**The goal** \n\nTo democratize coffee production, preventing small-scale coffee farmers from being exploited by intermediate traders, processors and importers.\n\n**Requirements for contributors** \n\n* Interest and patience in solving technical problems. Technical skills are a plus, but we\u2019ll also have places for newcomers.\n* By joining this project , you will develop a number of skills: Technical problem solving; product development; engineering skills in electronics, embedded computing, software development, artificial intelligence.\n\n**Project Mentors** \n\nMatthias Ansorg \n\n_\"It will use a small embedded computing platform like the Raspberry Pi 3 to control some mechanical parts (stepper motors etc.) and run image classifiers (\u201cartificial intelligence\u201d) software to decide which beans to sort out. This will allow very exact sorting, and to our knowledge has never been done before. Check also the[ project overview](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-source-optical-coffee-sorter/7122).

If you\u2019re already thinking about it, you probably are on your way to doing it. Motivating others to do the same however, is a completely different challenge. Merely a better government or a better law is a demand passed through many generations that most definitely is inadequate right now. Even the need of a \u201cquality\u201d education is a platitude; students are scoring higher every new year. So what is it that we lack?\n\nLong story short, it is time we focus on internal motivation; it is important we focus on our drive to succeed. Discipline, to begin things, followed by the knowledge to understand the people and hence motivate them to act. A distinction in an SLC exam shouldn\u2019t be mandatory but morality should. \u201cEducation\u201d shouldn\u2019t be compulsory but the morality to understand how it feels to pick others\u2019 trash should. This is what I mean by discipline, a strong internal motivation to understand the society and to work towards its progress, persistently.\n\nHow do we do it? Besides textbooks, the diversity of community and lifestyle in our country should be experienced by every becoming youth. It is time for the adults to focus on a single household and concentrate on their children instead of trying to change the entire society, unsuccessfully. Each disciplined motivated child will later be a part of the society that will move towards stronger tomorrow.\n\nThe elder population, should most definitely be encouraged to enlighten the others through age old beliefs and rules, keeping them updated of our culture, while we move towards change that is the need of time.\n\nI believe, this is a rule that every individual, every household can undertake. If these grassroot level changes can be achieved by us individuals then hopefully we can be an active part of the society that is ready to change, for better. Change is definitely a collaborative effort but the quality of collaboration counts. We make stronger collaboration, for stronger tomorrow.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-21 13:43:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:42:08.633147", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 367, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9320, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2507, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Great!

Countries with different cultures but meeting the same challenges: Reduction of the unemployment rate, economic development and more equality between the different regions of the country. The striking resemblance of young people in their countries is their big ambition and determination to change the reality of their country and contribute actively to its economic development.\n\nIn the 7 workshops we conducted in the region where we adopted methodologies specifically designed to help participants design their professional projects, we were able to identify the following three issues:\n\n* Companies recruit mainly experienced profiles, making access to the job market difficult for juniors and young graduates.\n\n* Business creation / entrepreneurship has been presented to its young people as an alternative to unemployment, however bureaucracy and lack of resources prevent some from embarking on the entrepreneurial adventure.\n\n* The environment and working conditions in local businesses do not stimulate the creativity of its young talents, some of them seriously think about leaving their jobs.\n\nTo provide an alternative that meets the needs of the majority of the participants, we have integrated the **OpenVillage Academy**, a new component of the large OpenVillage project. The academy offers a three-month period which allows young people to develop their talents by working on existing open source projects lead by more experienced, entrepreneurial, peers.\n\nThis means they develop hard and soft skills by building meaningful things in a supportive and multicultural environment, while supporting one another to move for good projects forward.\n\nIn addition to the practical part of the internship that will be provided by the project leader (Edgeryders Community Entrepreneur) and his / her team, the OpenVillage Academy offers participants workshops and activities to strengthen their skills to make them more employable in the labor market. \n\nAt the end of his / her course at the open village, a certificate validating the participant's personal qualities, aptitudes, skills and professional know-how will be awarded.", "created_at": "2017-11-05 13:41:06.165485", "updated_at": "2017-12-30 22:45:59.249515", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 47, "score": 364.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4056, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78067, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13751, "post_number": 13, "raw": "[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:11, topic:13751\"]\n* Include millenia at year at the top (12-05- **20** 20)\n* Use labels alongside the colors (\u201cCampfire\u201d)\n[/quote]\n\n\nDates can indeed be formatted. \nFor labels, as far as I know there is no way to control them separately. There are three options: keep them all, all the time; hide them all; and make them appear when the node is created, and fade later. This last option will make also appear the labels of the parent nodes, including the categories. \n\nUnfortunately, at this scale and speed (1 day => 0.05 seconds) the third option still looks super messy.

Situation in rural areas are generally and historically different, yet the regional centers are becoming more accepting to new trends which is great\n\n<span>- The government is hard to move forward, yet with the new people on governmental positions and some of the lobbying, now more and more government is accepting changes. Even though the middle level of burocracy, as Alberto has written is quite hard to cooperate, yet with the good will from international bodies and some support from the civil society, it's possible to push things forward</span>\n\n<span>- Grassroot initiatives are scattered throughout all Ukraine. Major quantities are of course in the main regional or national centers, yet it's becoming more of a development in less populated regions. Yet, problematics are still present.

We are a country of 90 million - bigger than German - and thus you are bound to find a little bit of everything here; and huge potential in every market. Tagaddod are working on producing 100 tonnes of biodiesel a month; and that would still be less than a percent of what the country consumes!\n\nIn Cairo, and Egypt by extension, we have a very visible Garbage problem. I say visible, because you see a lot of Garbage in the streets and in public spaces; basically the little grey areas which the Zabaleen don't service. This is a political issue in a sense that government is judge based on their ability to hold the garbage in check; it is very much in public discourse.\u00a0\n\nWhat is unseen and unfelt by the normal citizen is the efficiency of the Zabaleen system. It is easy to complain over a dump in the street surrounded by flies; it is irrelevant that this maybe a percent or 2 of all garbage collected in the city and is just the tip of the iceberg.

It would be great!)\n\n- send invitations to the participants (next week)\n\n- start working on a presentation for the introduction of the meeting, and find a methodology to animate it in order to align with the participants and find common grounds for collaboration. (week of 17th of August)\n\n-7th of September hold the meeting\n\nWill post updates, as soon as we have more!\n\nRuxandra\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-05 15:09:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.599478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 445, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4770, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4737, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Armenian initiative on stewarding public spaces.

After 4 years one most pressing need is finding people to teach us how self-organising communities can grow healthy at scale - through stories, examples and guidance. A bit like mentors. The outcome for them would be developing their projects as part of Edgeryders, and accessing a global pool of knowledge.

This took the form of forum posts, telephone calls and community hangouts. I will thank them here, while pointing out the different forms mentorship can take. \n\nFirstly, I will thank Marco Manca of SCImPULSE Foundation. We had several telephone calls during the Fellowship months and every one of them was enlightening. Although a difficult medium to transfer deep insight, Marco managed to transfer years\u2019 worth of knowledge during these calls. His clarity in my projects, a few countries away from him, speaks more of his ability than the potential of this method of mentoring. However, as it is an accessible way of connecting, I find phone calls a valuable asset in mentorship.\n\nSecond, the Edgeryders platform and its users, to complement the phone calls. Also nicknamed \u201cblack-hole of knowledge\u201d at several occasions when you find yourself continuously clicking through content years old, yet eerily relevant. It is through the platform that progress can be shared in an easily digestible manner for people you will have a call with or people who just have 10 minutes to spare to comment on your story. And it scales nicely: the more people on there, the more interactions, the richer the learning for everyone involved. Here is a special thanks in place to Noemi for being the beating heart of the Edgeryders community, and Alberto and Nadia who don\u2019t shy away from deeply and critically reacting to whatever you type into the platform.\n\nThird, your offline peers. In our projects, there is a strong sense of togetherness and we don\u2019t shy away from supporting each other with personal as well as professional issues. Sharing work, resources, knowledge and helping each other grow. We enjoy creating possibilities for one another. If not for their support, I would have quit countless times before. The collective learning amplifies into concrete outcomes, which amplifies the learning. I feel like these learning \u2013 doing \u2013 learning cycles are crucial for groups of people attempting to push boundaries.\n\nFourth, persons who share interests and serendipity. The value of coincidental conversations and subsequent accidental discoveries cannot be understated. \u201cGoing out there\u201d and talking to people is simply essential to break out of habits and networks you already know.\n\nI look forward to deepening insight on mentorship and applying some of these principles for future learning and teaching endeavours!", "created_at": "2017-11-01 17:04:27.414123", "updated_at": "2017-11-01 17:04:27.414123", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 411, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 304.2, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5, 8, 1935, 3703, 4, 3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28158, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 4259, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Meet tomorrow</b>\n\nI'm guessing that means you are not going to be able to make a meeting tomorrow Ben?\n\nThe lack of any affirmations of attendance/interest makes me slightly hesitant, but I'm going to try and hold the space this month.\u00a0 Last month attendance was unclear and there were 8 of us there.\u00a0\n\nI'll be at Royal Festival Hall, level 5, in the corner furthest away from Waterloo station (I think it was called - blue side?) from 12 o'clock for at least a couple of hours.\u00a0 I'll have some food to share (suitable for vegetarians, vegans &amp; wheat intolerant - even though I'm none of these)\u00a0 I'll ware my stripy yellow &amp; black hoody - so I/our group will be easily identifiable.\n\nWill I be dining alone??\u00a0 I'll update and let you all know.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-30 11:20:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.248311", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 157, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15894, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 516, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>What else is mutating?</b>\n\nHey @steelweaver \u2013 thanks for this.

Local resources, local production and close loops of feedstocks can provide solutions, in which time and cost to transform used feedstocks need to be taken into account.\n* the **homogenisation of the nutrients** (glucose, etc) if we standardise the processes on a global scale. Sugar will become a precious resource, and we want to avoid situations like palm oil plantages.\n* the **consumerism behaviour** about producing more biodegradable stuff:[quote=\"Gammarra, post:6, topic:8790\"]\nthe more efficient we are at making, the more we consume and polute\n[/quote]\n\n\n\nAll those aspects also question the **production scale**: how do we scale the manufacturing process that happens at the micro-scale in the organism to large scale production without harming the environment? Or maybe how do we decrease the actual large-scale production to micro-scale production?\n\nReadily available biotechnology will disrupt existing economic models, as abundance reduces costs. Even an automated manufacturing technology will not create an unlimited abundance, since raw materials and energy will always be needed. There is a quite well documented [wikipedia page on post-scarcity economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity\\_economy).\n\nAnd this seems to me a good summary:\n\n> **Natural law resource based economy**\n> The five attributes proposed by Peter Joseph in his book _The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing the Economy to End Oppression_ (2017) form the foundation of the natural law resource based economy (NLRBE) concept for a post-scarcity worldview:\n\n> **Automation**: Transition from labor-for-income emphasis to machine automation emphasis. Goals: Maximize productive capacity; reduce human exposure; increase efficiency.\n> **Open-access**: Transition from property/ownership emphasis to strategic access emphasis. Goals: Maximize good use-time efficiency; reduce production pressure; increase overall good availability for use.\n> **Open-source**: Transition from proprietary research, data hoarding, and internal development to collaborative commons contributions. Goal: Maximize innovation.\n> **Localization**: Transition from globalization to localization, emphasizing networked design. Goals: Maximize productive/distribution efficiency; reduce waste.\n> **Networked digital feedback**: Transition from fragmented economic data relay to fully integrated, sensor-based digital systems. Goals: Maximize feedback and information efficacy/utilization; increase total economic efficiency.\n\nThe biotechnological innovations have environmental and social consequences that are driven by the current context in which it is developed. If the current mechanisms of our system are actually at stake I don't see how to induce a systemic change? Future directions are coloured by the contours of the actual system.\n\n----------\n\n## Genetic modification\n\nHow do we want **genetic modified biomaterials** to be regulated? Indeed the engineered strain will for sure mutate if it comes into nature. Nobody will be able to control this. We can impose strict protocols of production, with clear tests of the materials made inert before it leaves the production factory. \n\n----------\n## Design features\n[quote=\"filip, post:5, topic:8790\"]\nwe design things and that in return they design us\n[/quote]\n\nWhat is the role of the designer, specially in a context of cross disciplinary collaborations? Design and biology are now perceived as two different fields, but the distinction in not relevant anymore. Bio-engineers are becoming designers and designers are becoming bio-engineers.  \n\nAll living matter might evolved to engineered matter, predictable and functional. Humans have difficulties dealing with complexity and diversity. We have already edited out so many crops and animals in agriculture, and this evolution will continue in all fields. Designers will program DNA code like they now program software. We should question our relationship with nature cause soon it might not exits anymore. \n\nOr maybe it will be the other way: all engineered matter will be living matter. The qualities of nature, like self-healing, self-organisation, adaptation, entropy, decay will overrule our controlled processes. In this case, what are the design methods that should be adapted?", "created_at": "2018-06-28 08:20:43.356943", "updated_at": "2018-06-28 08:20:43.356943", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 640, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 117.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [45811], "is_reply_to": [45821, 45811], "is_liked_by": [3362, 4508], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78422, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 65, "raw": "And this is before monday begins...\n\n![IMG_0161|690x517](upload://cy9ZYr8HFuyB0uoKPHTarz8t0oG.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-06-07 19:30:34.990894", "updated_at": "2020-06-07 19:30:34.990894", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 9.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50905, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9451, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Update to all: I received an email from Gorka Espiau, a guy I know who is working in the Mondragon space.

Is it just to enable people to operate within legal frameworks? or should the hours and energy we expend week after week be do towards visions of a world where legal frameworks are obsolete?

Coral polyps build coral reefs, which act as a scaffolding structure for very diverse ecosystems. But of course the corals are not deliberately trying to do that: they have no purpose. However, for the many species that depend on reefs, they have a <em>function</em> \u2013 that of building the reef which is a home to some species, a hunting ground for their predators etc.\n\nFunction is an eye-of-the-beholder thing. It is <em>you</em> that, looking at Edgeryders, observe that it builds bridges between the edge and mainstream societies. But this is ok from a design point of view, because then you might ask yourself \"by virtue of which changes would Edgeryders do this better?\" And this is indeed a design question.\n\nIf you try to get everyone on the same page you are in for a lot of frustration. It would be like asking the corals, the small fish and the predators to agree that the corals change their way of building in the interest of the predators. They would not understand your point that you want to improve the sea-snakes hunting experience, because they see themselves as simply building hexoskeletons. If you want a diverse community to bend around a design decision, you need to sell a complex deal which different people can see in theor own terms: metaphorically, stronger hexoskeleton building for the corals, better hiding possibilities for the starfish and the urchins, more nutrients for the algae, more prey for the predators...\n\nOut of the metaphor, if you are interested in building bridges between the edge and mainstream societies, I would advise you proceed as folllows.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Identify some activities that edgeryders carry out that are conducive to building bridges \u2013 in your language, that \"serve that purpose\".</li>\n\n<li>Figure out how to help them in those activities.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nYou really don't need to waste your time in agreeing with anybody on a high-level description.

If we can find proposals that match most of the list, I think we'll be on the right track for a real education reform :-)\n\nAbout what you wrote, I can't agree more about personal potential. I have a theory about societies, individualism and collectivism, related to income, happiness and other factors. It's an huge one and I haven't got a lot of data, so it's not scientific-proof. But my instincts tell me that it could be right.\n\nI see a correlation between individualism (without connotation, positive nor negative) and economically rich and mainly stable societies, while I see an inverted trend in poorer countries (strictly economically speaking).\n\nMy guess is that individualism is inevitable in a society where the most basic and medium needs are satisfied (see Maslow's pyramid, as an example), and it's not a product of this specific period of history.\n\nIn my view, individualism is a huge opportunity, and not a problem; here in Italy - maybe also due to religion - there is a deep.. caution against individual thinking. It's percieved as a threath to the status quo. You must be aligned, or else you'll be excluded. That's nonsense for me, since we then glorify people who break the rules (in good and bad ways)\n\nI think we could try to be more than that. By archiving our personal potential, we can be really focused on improving society, not as and imposition, but as a natural instinct.\n\nSorry for my bad written english again, I hope i've made myself clear.

Specifically, I am interested in the question whether certain conventions that could make us better collaborators (say: writing good documentation, or refraining from using rhetorical tricks on each other) are self-enforcing. The computational biology framework can give you answers like: if you get the proportion of good cooperators above a threshold, it the convention becomes self-enforcing and the system moves towards a higher level of cooperation (therefore efficiency etc.).

Privatization is also not an option seen as solution, as it creates oligarchy.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\tThe best solution is stewardship by communities coming to the forefront, when assets are not owned by anyone for individualistic purposes, but just being taken care of, collectively.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\tStewardship can be a personal life choice, when a person devotes their life to fixing various problems in a community. Also, communities can be seen as stewards as well.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCommunity (as a gathering, as a feeling, as a platform) is the core pillar for stewardship concept, as it was reflected in the Lote4 discussions.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\tIt can also be said that stewardship is about making things work and about improving community living. If community is understood as a platform, it should not be just a platform, it needs to serve people.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSharing economy is a start, but communities should look beyond that and share other assets, such as ideas, resources, etc. Money is just one of a means to compensate for one's work.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCommunication is vital, between peers, between communities, on politics and policy level. People need to be dependent on each other.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tStewardship is about freedom. Freedom of assets, freedom of people. No one can force someone to become a steward. It's a free decision.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tStewardship is a daily work and requires a lot of commitment. Stewards should be careful not to overwork themselves and not to burn out.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tProcess of stewardship is as important as outcomes are, and inclusion is the key.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Emerging new themes from stewardship:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>The future of health and social care in the hands of hackers</strong>. Governments are at odds when it comes to making honest <a href=\"http://www.ipe.com/low-interest-rates-a-nightmare-for-pension-funds-minister-says/46105.fullarticle\">projections </a>for societal well-being, in times of ageing populations and shrinking state budgets. Care systems are increasingly deemed unable to cater to the needs of tomorrow\u2019s elderly populations, many of whom are today\u2019s unemployed, migrants, or poor. At Edgeryders after Lote4, we\u2019re starting to envision a system of care by a community of hackers, armed with cheap, open source tools, which would gather most promising bottom up solutions such as new types of care homes as intergenerational co-living spaces, open medical technologies as alternatives to the Internet of Things and more that can be the focus of future prototypes, with development amplified by Open Ethnographer.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Building capacity and resilience in stewardship livelihoods</strong>. In several sessions at LOTE the stewards\u2019 precarious condition was explored, particularly since most truly innovative projects are low resourced and voluntary, with small groups shouldering a great size of the effort (see <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Communities-F8r2VazmLYw\">examples</a>). The risks are manifold for achieving impact, from mismanaging expectations or resources (not enough eyeballs), to loss of <a href=\"https://storify.com/throw_away/lote4-reliability\">reliability</a> (achieving growth by compromising) or even burnouts (\u2018temporary ownership is an aspect of precarity\u2019, notices one of the stewards). These all reproduce the same inequalities which stewarding is trying to address by increasing use value: inequalities in access, in consumption, in relative gains and so on. Who is caring for the stewards? Who else can and should act as carrier for the learnings? What can we learn from open hardware/software projects combating scarcity (\u2018so hard to do that without ending up homeless eating nothing but beans\u2019, says an Edgeryder)? These are but some of the deeper questions we could begin to address with our approach of network engagement and Open Ethnographer.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Market and engagement failures in the sharing economy. </strong>The boundaries between community sharing and commercial sharing are <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/sharing-and-caring/\">blurred</a>, as shown by the experience of the industry titans AirBnb or Uber. As an example of stewardship, the sharing economy is indeed creating social benefits, but its transactions go beyond cooperation and the staggering amount of personal data collected on platforms is powerful and to an extent threatening. Can newer collaborative environments, like <a href=\"http://falkvinge.net/2013/09/09/the-swarm-economy-is-not-silicon-valleys-sharing-economy/\">swarm economies</a> or <a href=\"http://makerfox.com\">non-monetary </a>ones come up with fairer social contracts for their communities?

The main move now necessary to increase the impact and effectiveness of freelancing and to grow the space in a healthy way would be to focus on enabling teamwork and collaboration between freelancers.    Today the big platforms and tools are built for companies, not for networks of freelancers.\n2. To start ou there are many free tools and learning platforms, but the more you professionalize, the more you will gravitate to whichever tool does it best.\n3. there are different types of \"monopoles\", some are through merit, some through lack of alternative. The former seem acceptable, the later unavoidable for a single freelancer.\n3. Our thought experiment about what type of tools we would wish to lead us to:\n    * Something that bundles different communication platforms so that one can have all conversations with collaborators and clients listed together in one place no matter which platforms and tools they are using on their side.\n    * A tool that also generates a comprehensible story of your previous conversations, issues and solutions with a certain collaborator to keep track of your collaboration history.\n4. **Collaboration over Competition** as in point 1, is the future in freelancing to focus on collaboration? leading from this I just was thinking further: *How could freelancer organise? Would it make sense to have freelancer unions? Would that be possible? Would that make any sense? In different disciplines or even across?* \n5. Freelancing has been on the rise in the last few years, but Covis has increased this development.

At this, behavioral economists shook their head and embarked on a completely different trajectory. It seems that the same problem applies to EA: commodity specification shrinks the pool of offers\u00a0<span>available to close any deal... but this can't be helped, we just need to hope to achieve critical mass in at least some of these dimensions.

And of the two, I emphasize the latter because one could gain a Fellowship that way and not do a more formal proposal (at least not right off), whereas if one wrote a formal proposal and did not participate actively here on the platform, one's chances would be lessened greatly.  Indeed, the Fellowship is about participating and bringing in one's network to join in on the conversations, here and in group calls. It all culminates in the final event, but that event is built on what we talk about here.\n\nRegarding our process, we are slowly going about reviewing and making our selections (more slowly than anticipated), so the announcements are not confined to May, as it says above.  And what we consider a proposal is not a narrow use of that word, as you astutely point out.  We're looking for people doing work that furthers the goals of both the Internet of Humans/NGI Forward project in general and Edgeryders' part of it more specifically, who regularly communicate about it to a network of colleagues and friends that is deeply embedded in Europe.

I already organised events, and bigger than this, but never had to build a community and do it in such a short time.\nMany unexpected things happened. Even though I expected to meet skepticism, I though I will have an easier time convincing people why is this such a good idea.\nThe importance of sharing the stories, getting to know each other, learning about real issues in lives of other people around us. Engaging in discussions to find solution to those issues, often common for many people, and just to support each other. Activate this collective intelligence, then use the stories to connect people and form teams who can actually work together to change things with real projects/initiatives (I am very goal orientated).\nOver the past month I improved my processes a lot. And I created an animated tutorial for all newcomers, which still needs to be smoothed out a bit and I will share it with you guys for suggestions. We can easily add a voice over and it should be quite effective.\nGot the idea because many people were a bit lost on the platform and needed help with some things. Just yesterday I had another confused person :slight_smile:. \nI also never was a facilitator or moderator in discussion panels or similar so I am happy I am part of Wellbeing in Europe. Gives me opportunity to learn a lot of new skills and help communities I care about as well. \n\nIt started with my trip to Serbia last month. My idea was to create core groups in few cities and if they are interested in a project, they will help grow it themselves.\nThanks to many people who got engaged and saw importance in such a project, we got to where we are now. @TamaraVuk and @noemi  of course but so many locals as well who got engaged very early on: @kiszoltan8 from KEC Becej, @Ede @Oxilon @marijanesque from Becej as well.\nAlso @tihana and @n0vakovic who got engaged immediately like Tamara and helped out just on the basis of our skype talk...helped me so much with the first meetup in Belgrade. They helped a lot with everything for the Belgrade workshop we had now as well.\nHad great discussions with @miremire @Tatjana and @Pokrajac @Oxilon , among other people, it gave me a lot of energy and motivation to keep working at it...we have some great ideas as well. I am sure some of the good ones will be put to test by the communities in 2020 :wink:.\n\nI postponed this post because I got stuck in Serbia for an extra week. Spent 6 days recovering from eye troubles but as soon as I felt better, I set up 2 days of meetings and was invited to few events.\n\nResult is this bunch of notes (new ideas and interesting insights into local politics and perception of us from some of the local NGO's.\nI did not expect that but, it seems some of the local NGO's see us as direct competition and are afraid for their position...that's why they did not support us even though we have similar missions. The surprising part for me is-they determined it without even communicating with me/us properly. Very silly.\n![notes|689x238,50%](upload://f4u4yWkL4APBSkxTwm4rHoJ1owi.jpeg) \n\nAnd I got a thank you from the Office for Youth in Becej, which I don't feel I deserve but they sure did put extra pressure on me to do a good job haha.\n![zahvalnica|517x690,50%](upload://9J1bIUOI6bqagZ72pKKTPObS1LM.jpeg) \nI actually learned a lot about organising an event for younger generations just from observing everything during the Office for Youth celebration of 13 years of their existence...a lot to change really if we are to do events for youth in future.\n\nAlso met with professors, and teachers, few school principals. There is a lot of good will to move forward with the proposal I build with several community members (sort of center for innovation/incubator hub in Becej). Teachers and professors especially see the importance of bridging the gap of theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge you get through doing things and experimenting. That gap in Serbia is very big.\n\nI see communities in Serbia growing over this month already. Based on my many many discussions with people and organisations, we will see activity and energy to move forward.\nIf that happens, we as Edgeryders can join in their initiatives and support them as their international partner. There is a lot of potential there, I just hope the community will see it as well.\nAlready heard plenty of good ideas, about recycling/reusable materials utility (big issue here), education and work on raising people's awareness, healthy food promotion/distribution etc...\nThe way I see it happening is (in this order):\n1. Active community willing to get involved in real issues linked to wellbeing\n2. Edgeryders seeing the activity and determining our way forward\n3. Doing few more events in January (or later if we still don't have enough info/activity) with specific goals of growing community and mobilising it in the causes they most care about. If causes are aligned with our values and Wellbeing in Europe of course.\n4. Ideally, if all 3 points above are met, we can engage the research team and find relevant EU tenders to really get the projects off the ground. ER+local organisations+relevant international partners if needed.\n(I also don't know what are budget for 2020 is yet).\n\nOf course, most of other things don't make sense if we don't have active community. That's what I focused on over the last several days and hopefully the message went through.\nThe biggest lessons for me were the new insights in the state of mind of population in different communities in Serbia. Also I learned there are so many stories of success and hope, so many people actually trying to make the society better.\nThe thing is, nobody talks about them so much as much as they talk about all the negative stuff going on.\nSo maybe one of our biggest goals would also be, get the inspirational stories and distribute that message in our community in 2020.", "created_at": "2019-12-02 09:41:55.701197", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 09:10:45.410524", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1050, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 69.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 6054], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86414, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 193, "raw": "https://twitter.com/aravosis/status/1325221595816882177", "created_at": "2020-11-07 23:49:03.459185", "updated_at": "2020-11-07 23:49:03.459185", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86413], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66819, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12096, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Interview: Lisa Bozek**\n\n*Head of Information Management*\n\n*Responsible for digital transformation:*\n\n*Helping people to help the communication tools we have to collaborate better from a distance.*\n\n*Learn different ways of using the technology*\n\n*Ongoing project redesigning the communication landscape.*\n\n>> Lisa is working on exactly the same as goal as this project, we want her to be involved in developing the specific best practice recommendations and as her to share her insights up to this point.

She stresses that quite often there is a problem with people signing on to talks online and then dropping out when the workload from different sides becomes too much. She also described how when discussions and workshops could not be finished in synchronous video calls and are converted in asynchronous different tasks, it is hard to make people follow through on this. She has to keep reminding them and even if she schedules time in their calendars for those tasks, they are often delayed.\n\n> \u201cRemembering colleagues of asynchronous work. Messages help to gage importance. I do not take it personally if others remind me, but maybe others do.\n> \n> People committing to contribute, but then have to drop out.\n> \n> As a manager: how do you know how much workload people have? Just rusting in peoples self-reporting.\u201d\n\n>>\u201cWeren\u2019t able to get everything done in an online workshop. Therefore, they added another half, in writing asynchronous, but that needs more time and follow up investment.\n\n>>Booking time into the calendar, but they are not disciplined to use that time for that task. \u201c\n\n**This brings us to the idea of further needs for good remote asynchronous collaboration:**\n\n1. Conventions of systems for scheduling time for those types of work especially in a system like Climate KIC where a lot of meetings are scheduled. Ideas:\n\n  >> Having dedicated hours in the weekly schedule for those tasks where no meetings can be scheduled\n\n2. Thinking about reminder and workload-signalling systems.\n\n  >> In an office you see your coworker on the other end of the room and remember that you have o prepare x for them, that does not happen when working remotely.

I'm back from holiday. \n\nThis sounds very good as a plan, as long as we keep our terminology consistent. We need to be very clear about the distinction between categories and hierarchies in our vocabulary. Categories are the organising principles that we use to structure our codes. So these are categories: \n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:137, topic:13988\"]\n3.1. Type of action or inaction (Examples from \u201cold\u201d typology: engagement tactics\n3.2. Actor (types)\n3.3. Issue (Example: \u201ceducation\u201d [level 2] --> \u201cright to education\u201d [level 3]\n3.4. Ideology\n3.5. Emotions\n3.6. Value(s)\n3.7. Places/locations/scale\n3.8. Institutions\n3.9. Time:\n3.9.1. History/past\n3.9.2. Diagnosis of the present\n3.9.3. Prognosis\n[/quote]\n\nAnd these look great as categories! We should not, however, call them hierarchies, because that will confuse us with the backend hierarchies, which are ontologically much stricter. So it's a three level **categorisation** structure. \n\nAs you say, some of these categories will become parent-child codes in the hierarchy in the backend (Level 3 and Level 2, in your parlance, as \"right to education\" is definitely a strict ontological child of \"education\"). Some will not. \n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:137, topic:13988\"]\n4. What emerges is the project\u2019s \u201cgrammar.\u201d For example, we can construct the following sentence: John, who is a teacher [actor type] writes about a lack of clean water in his appartment complex [situation] and decided to form a group [type of action] and follow his belief in the need to help people [ideology], particularly in his town [place/location]. He is intimates that he is very angry [emotion] and compares the present crisis to a much better situation before the fall of communism [history].\n[/quote]\n\nThis is a good way to approach coding in general. We make sure that we are roughly assigning codes that belong to each category so we are telling explanatory stories. @Leonie and @katejsim, this is very much along the lines of what I was trying to explain re: good coding practice. The codes should tell a story about what the informant is trying to say. \n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:137, topic:13988\"]\n\u201cemotion\u201d <---->\u201cissue\u201d at Level 1, so we can see how many issues are approached in an emotional manner.\n[/quote]\n\nThese \"Level 1\" categories will not be codes that we assign to text, because they don't have much meaning as codes by themselves -- they are too vague (and we would much rather just group existing codes underneath them, as in a category, to save a lot of time while coding). We need to think about how we want to do this. In the Babel project we have such categories. @hugi, we could make them \"non-SSNA\" codes like in Babel, potentially, and/or assign each a colour to visually designate them in the graph... I'll think about it and perhaps we can have a call to discuss, @Jan, with @hugi if he has time, to think about the best approach. \n\nOnce we figure that top-level category designation out, I think all of this is perfect (and in the interim, we can still continue coding by assigning the \"level 2\" and \"level 3\" codes). We code trying to make sure we create codes from many of these categories, to try to construct sentences like the one you gave as an example.", "created_at": "2020-09-21 10:35:42.444842", "updated_at": "2020-09-21 10:36:45.821081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 569, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [83120], "is_reply_to": [83120], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30391, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4843, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Good omens all around</b>\n\nThank you so much, <a href=\"/u/howard_rheingold\">@Howard_Rheingold</a>, your endorsement carries a lot of weight \u2013 though it seems <a href=\"/u/johncoate\">@johncoate</a>\u00a0has won quite a few fans of his own already in Edgeryders.\u00a0\n\nWe'll do our very best to dream up something to do together.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.\n\nThis new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.\n\n[b]What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?[/b]\n\nWe are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:\n\n* collect experiences of community-driven care services\n* validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.\n* augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)\n* combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.\n\nThis is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we'll do it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process will be \u2013 and stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We are working on a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution, and will not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.\n\n[b]Care is deeply human.[/b] Everyone has first-hand experience of it. Even those if us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receving care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent prototypes. If you want to be involved you can stay up to date through the [newsletter](), [sign up]() to Edgeryders and come talk to us on our [workspace]().\n\nOpenCare is led by YOU, and assisted by a world-class partnership: Edgeryders, the University of Bordeaux, the City of Milan, WeMake, ScImpulse Foundation and the Stockholm School of Economics.  We will find a way to move forward together. We are grateful for the support of the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme.\n\n----------\n\n## :it: **_Italian version_** <a name=\"it\"></a>\n\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a8ccc167778df80b382917ca3057806d75123e16.jpg)\n\n\n<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"license\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\" style=\"border-width:0\"></a>\n<span>OpenCare</span> by <a href=\"/opencare/welcome-to-opencare\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">OpenCare Consortium</a> is licensed under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"license\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.\n\nPer la maggior parte della storia dell'umanit\u00e0, i servizi di cura \u2013 che oggi chiamiamo sanit\u00e0 e servizi sociali \u2013 sono stati prodotti dalle comunit\u00e0: familiari, amici e vicini si controllavano a vicenda per essere sicuri che tutti stessero bene, tenevano d'occhio gliuni i bambini e i genitori anzianidegli altri, e perfino somministravano semplici cure mediche. A partire dalla seconda met\u00e0 del ventesimo secolo, i paesi sviluppati sono passati a sistemi in cui i servizi di cura venivano erogati da professionisti, che lavoravano per il governo o per imprese moderne.\n\nQuesta nuova soluzione ha ottenuto risultati straordinari, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 basata sulla conoscenza scientifica e sulla tecnologia medica. Purtroppo, negli ultimi vent'anni \u00e8 stata messa sotto tensione: la domanda di servizi di cura (sanit\u00e0, servizi sociali, scuole per l'infanzia per bambini molto piccoli, cura per le persone anziane) sembra senza limiti, ma le risorse che le nostre economie vi destinano sono, invece, chiaramente limitate. In pi\u00f9, i tentativi  per razionalizzare il sistema e renderlo pi\u00f9 produttivo sembra de-umanizzare le persone che hanno bisogno di cura, trattandole come lotti in un processo di produzione industriale.\n\n[b]E se riuscissimo a creare un sistema che combina l'accesso alla scienza e alla tecnologia moderna della cura prestata dallo stato e dalle imprese private con i costi bassi e il tocco umano della cura prestata dalle comunit\u00e0?[/b]\n\nProveremo a fare proprio questo.

For the last few years I have been engaged in charitable purposed projects. I believe the \"Revill\" biochar stove has its best potential as a cooking device in the poorest countries. It is better than TLUD for the reasons Ed Revill has detailed. However, for the application I have suggested, it provides a potential for higher flexibility in selection of biomass and also would be much more feasible in terms of developing a fuel supply system than TLUD.\n\nI would like to see a protoype for a simplified version of the stove that could cook corn meal mush and beans and that is convenient to load biomass and unload charcoal. Ideally, the unit would have some ability to control temperature and of course be safe to use indoors. This may be too much, but it is good to start with a wish list. To have a product that is ultimately going to be manufactured in a country such as Kenya or Haiti, it has to be as simple as possible and also have as much cost driven out of it as possible.

Between the virus itself and the images flooding social media from the race protests in the US and across the world, everything feels pretty chaotic right now.\n\nWe are in uncharted territory and it feels like we are swimming through vast amounts of information each day. Whether this data is accurate, inaccurate, weaponised, divisive, healing, conciliatory or contradictory, as a society we are feeling at a loss with how to interpret and analyse it.\n\nAt EdgeRyders we have often spoken about the dangers of misinformation but this week we have increasingly questioned our inability to interpret what lies between the accurate and the inaccurate.\n\nHow can, and is, this grey information being shaped into a narrative that perpetuates a cycle of repression, violence and exclusion? Racism exists in the US, it is visible. But how do people react to information that racial transgressions happen closer to home?\n\nThis week we started a conversation to learn who is doing better when it comes to interpreting information and what can we learn from them? One of our members [has asked ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/disinformation-strategies-and-tactics/13702) if there are any communities where disinformation is less prevalent and if these models could be used to build a better internet.\n\nWe are also learning to see through the noise. We had a webinar with the research institute DeLab and its data scientists to help interpret the information from a big data project they undertook on Covid 19. Some of the results are really interesting - take a [look here ](https://covid.delabapps.eu/) and [feel free to comment](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world-applying-collective-intelligence-to-big-data-3rd-of-june/13537) if you have any thoughts on how to approach the interpretation of data.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been thinking about how we can constructively act on information to help us cope and support one another through challenging situations. Like rebuilding livelihoods in crashing economies which will be a large topic discussed at out \u201cMaking a Living\u201d Summit later this year.\n\nOur first presummit listening session focused on [community-oriented food projects](https://edgeryders.eu/t/after-covid19-while-food-businesses-are-failing-can-community-oriented-food-projects-be-the-way-forward/13409). Our [next session](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414) takes place on June 22 and brings together higher education workers and policymakers, human rights defenders and unionists to discuss labour conditions over the past two decades.\n\nFood for thought\n\nOne of our co-founders has created an [amazing visualized representation ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-visualized-a-tentative-animation/13751) of EdgeRyders\u2019 story since it was first established eight years ago. You can take a look at the video that shows over 70,000 posts written by our registered platform users.\n\nTake care and have a thoughtful week.\n\n---\n### \n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/120778280\n\n*Video art: I Was Always Trying To See You Through The Noise, by Karborn*\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Section 2\">\n\n\n<Form account='true' topic='12345'>\n\n### Form Example\n\nThis is a form example.

If edgeRyders wants a good solution to this problem, it will take a LOT of effort. That's not to say you shouldn't try - just be prepared for a lot of work.\n\nI'll list the possible solutions that come to my mind:\n\n1) Expand what you got.\n\nThis is probably the quickest thing, but actually in terms of developer time/effort it's as much work as setting up option 2. It's easier cos users won't have to learn much new stuff.\n\nCons:\n\nIt would take a very long time to get the same features in option 2 (years of dev time).\n\nIt's much harder to scale, and uses more server CPU time.\n\n2) Move entriely to email lists + a simple wiki and etherpad. This would probably be the solution I would recommend.\n\nPros:\n\nI'd say email lists are light years ahead of any web based forum software. The reason for this is that they've had more time to mature. With lists everyone is using a dedicated client on their local machine (e.g. Mozilla Thunderbird).\n\nThis gives you a better user experience because the software is running on your machine.\n\nIt gives you better search and organisation feature than you'll get on any web based thing.\n\nIt reduces the work done by the servers, because they only have to deal with backend stuff. This makes it by far the cheapest and easiest to scale.\n\nIt makes things like remote backup very easy.\n\nIt can be setup to be very secure with very little effort. (e.g. Encryption).\n\nCons:\n\nPeople would have to learn new tools. This applies to some degree with any change. But people might see learning to use thunderbird as more daunting then learning to use new website features. I'd actually agrue that it isn't. IF people are willing to read a page or two of text, and spend a small amount of time experimenting, most people could become fairly confident with thunderbird in 30 minutes. Then they'll be able to use it to communicate, and pick up the more advanced features as and when they need them.\n\nThere are some feautures I'd like that I can't think of an elegant way to do on lists. However, the only way to get them is option 4.\n\n3) Look at trying to get some commercial software pro bono. Sharepoint/Huddle? I guess you can't afford to pay for it, so you'd need to get one of those big software companies to sponsor edgeRyers.\n\n4) Completely rebuild the platform from scratch. Massive project. Long term, yes, I hope.

Also collectively contributing to a means to map and explore the creative community as a whole. We begin by presenting use cases: local tools developed by Team2121.ro to serve Timisoara's civic and cultural groups, and international platforms like edgeryders.eu. We continue with a facilitated interaction between participants. Everyone will practice offline and online sharing of experiences, in a process that involves 3 steps: speaking, listening, and documenting what is being said by others. The session concludes with instant uploading of workshop documentation and collective reflection, therefore making it possible to stay in touch after we part ways.\n\nYou're invited to participate in this session if:\n- you wish to learn how to make your project more visible and inclusive\n- you want to learn and practice digital tools for storytelling and blogging, collaboration, or team coordination\n- you are exploring new ways to mobilize your community locally and trans-nationally\n\nFacilitators:\n\n**Noemi Salantiu (Edgeryders)**: Digital storyteller, expert online collaborator and co-founder of Edgeryders. In the past eight years she has built a sustainable community organisation where all projects actively involve members and focus on fulfilling their aspirations for personal and professional development. \n\n**Marina Batinic (Edgeryders, Culture Hub Croatia)**: Marina is a freelance project manager based in Brussels and research coordinator at Edgeryders. She has been involved in cultural projects at the international level and she co-founded Culture Hub Croatia - Platform for Education, Creativity and Development through Culture with the aim to contribute to local communities through projects transmitting knowledge and expertise from the rest of Europe.\n\n**Valentin Muresan (Faber)**: Val is an action-driven community believer. He wears many hats from Intel Romania Country Manager, to co-founder of many communities (from runners to IT professionals) and investor in a privately-owned project to reconvert an industrial site into a creative community hub: Faber.\n\n[Event on Facebook.](https://www.facebook.com/events/648002845666306/permalink/693879241078666/) \n\nAnyone attending? :) @bistra maybe?

Then Nadia <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-italian-pm-renzi-both-right-wrong-culture-antidote-nadia-el-imam\">wrote</a> a piece too, saying we need larger investment in <strong>culture as innovation,</strong> not necessarily via new policy (too costly) but more through experimentation with well meaning policy makers on our side. Learning faster and cheaper.\n\nOn my end,  to push this track forward I got in touch with groups who are working for European Capitals of Culture bids (from Matera and Bucharest), and invited them to Brussels. They will be able to talk about reforming culture with one foot in and one out, meaning that they or we (Edgeryders is doing work on this too) are doing work at the intersection of independent and system's culture, as bridge builders.

Making that 'cost resources that ER LbG does not permanently have' - meaning paying people for posting, was maybe a mistake. The company has had at least one eroding effect on the community - people do not come here and post.

I think Assembl has a really novel application model -- such as with regards to a sort of a manner of a view about discussions as \"Dynamic events,\" in a sense.\u00a0\n\nCandidly, I was finding much difficulty with the web interface itself. I wonder if perhaps anyone has considered developing an Eclipse RCP application analogous to the web-based Assembl user interface? The Eclipse Rich Client Platform is more-or-less one of the foundation components of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://eclipse.org/\">Eclipse</a>\u00a0IDE.\n\nPerhaps someone could develop an\u00a0<em>Assembl for Android</em>\u00a0app, alternately?\n\nWith regards to the thesis concept proposed of this article's title text, on having read some of the existing literature with regards to knowledge management -- including the text,\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.472.8815\">Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and an agenda...</a>\u00a0</em>in an edition in which the text is titled,\u00a0<em>Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues</em>\u00a0 -- I'm of an impression that there may be something of a sort of of \"Static\" view of Knowledge, developed in some of enterprise, perhaps somehow a manner of a perspective that may be\u00a0<em>en vogue</em>\u00a0with regards to information theory. \u00a0I do not believe as if knowledge could be like any sort of thing layed out in marble, though.\n\nIn reference to the previous text, it seems to me that the term \"Knowledge\" is applied as in as often in a \u00a0context where a term \"Resource\" might serve as a practical synonym. I do not believe as if knowledge, per se, exists in any manner of a material resource itself. In regards to the Asembl discussion model, I think it presents a much more <em>dynamic </em>and <em>well structured</em> way to interact -- \u00a0juxtaposed to the relatively dynamic, but \"Flat\" or \"Linear\" structured layout of the microblog content of Twitter, or the conventional blog content of social neworking sites such as Facebook and G+.\n\nI do not believe it would necessarily be a trivial thing, to make an Eclipse IDE application after the Assembl UI. So far as \"Blue sky\" project ideas, I think it is in an idea at least.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-19 21:57:24", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 21:05:19.645769", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 442, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 471, "user_id": 2555, "topic_id": 438, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear all,\n\nThere is an open call where you can find all details on the below web adress.\n\nPlease get in contact with me if you have an eligible coordinator, co-coordinator, partner organizations and project idea. with my best \u00a0:)\n\nhttps://webgate.ec.europa.eu/europeaid/online-services/index.cfm?ADSSChck=1432717345761&amp;do=publi.welcome&amp;orderbyad=Desc&amp;searchtype=RS&amp;orderby=upd&amp;nbPubliList=15&amp;aofr=150147&amp;userlanguage=en\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-04 08:57:19", "updated_at": "2017-08-07 13:21:25.629430", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 84, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22646, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 763, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Hard to argue with that</b>\n\n<em>Socialization is the elephant in the room and teenagers are in no mans land</em>\n\nWell, this is for sure.

I am following this process for [my workshop on Ai and Justice](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326) and it is working really well.\n\n1. Update your event description above with the following:\n    * Add a question that you want to answer through the session\n    * Add an Faq Section (you can copy paste the one on my workshop description)\n   * Add a description of the format. if you can make it a bit interactive or identify a specific methodology you will be using that\u2019s great.  *Feel free to ask if you need help with this*\n2. Make it easy for us to promote it:\n   * Give @MariaEuler photos/visuals + statements/quotes she can use to customise design for a flyer and for a header for this event (as part of the festival)\n3. See what you think of this approach to one on one outreach for getting good input to help you develop the session, and the broader discussion you wish to build around the topics of your fellowship:\n   * You send emails with to people you think can contribute to this discussion with personalised invitation using content from the one I forwarded you as a template/model\n   * If they agree you can forward them to a member of Edgeryders staff (@inge for now) who then does the interview &amp; transcribes content, and helps them to get on platform. You would need to agree with her on what questions you would like to ask\u2026\n4. Read the articles posted by the contributers and write a summary. Perhaps you can also draw help from the data analysis team to make visualisations that can help you synthesise what is there and share it back with a nice visual graph.

Once the minibuss is full they leave, collect money in cash (very cheap + no tickets issued) and then it makes stops along what I believe is a set route. You don't really need to know when they arrive because they are really frequent, but finding means of transport to where you want to go is really tricky, also because there isn't a standardised system of addresses especially if you are out in the informal settlements.

I was there to visit <a href=\"/u/irmawilson\">@IrmaWilson</a> a while back and gave up on using any other means of transport than the Gautrain (to and from airport) and taxis.

We were happy to have two experts: @BaobabUrbain (working with Toestand at AlleeduKaai and Edgeryders at [The Reef](https://edgeryders.eu/t/join-the-reef-community-workshops-making-of-communal-and-green-living-in-brussels/10897)) and Victor from FEBUL - F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bruxelloise de l\u2019Union pour le Logement. Both of them are walking encyclopedias and together they know the civic/institutional scene very very well. \n\nSome of my raw reflections here, I hope they can be helpful in continuing to think about the issue.\n\n* The Belgian law is not ready yet for sustainable occupations that lead to innovation, even though several organisations have professionalized in taking over, activating and maintaining spaces - like Communa and Toestand.\n* Even in the non-profit scene, there is a **difference between access to spaces and making them a social innovation engine.** Often, the orgs who get spaces become experts, like real estate agents, but they dont have capacity to engage many more in the community service, for example in what the space can do for the neighborhood. This is a self-fulfilling gap: the organisations need to access more and more spaces to make their ends meet, because with the space they get resources for 1 person on a payroll to manage/host the space for a year. In the principle of economies of scale, they need more spaces to get going, but the lack of capacity for social innovation is severe and doesn't get solved with just access to space. \n* People talk about the need to build ecosystems, but in practice this is difficult. La Buissonni\u00e8re, for example, where we were hosting the workshop, is a former school. Now the commune of St Gilles gives the access to Communa ASBL. It\u2019s rented, sharing space with other \u201cporteurs de projets\u201d, social innovations \u201cstartups\u201d, and on the first floor people are actually living. The startups or other collectives coming in cannot open themselves that much to the outside community. \n\nWays forward could be pursued around the following:\n* **More collaboration.** There are actors in a \u201ccomfort zone\u201d, but we need to go out of it if we want to use occupations for social change. There's a need to be going for calls for proposals together with other social actors. \n* **Collective advocacy,** like Brussels St Vide - Leegbeek needs to focus on content, not just the media message of 'there are unused spaces!'. All the actors where asking the same question: what to do next? Cooperative governance, discourse of an additional commune - the idea of coming together. We developed positions: non profit projects, cultural, sustainable and social but also new relationship with policy makers - an advocacy tool for policy makers, to learn where are the gaps in the law and to make proposals. \n* **Operational advocacy**, in which organisations like FEBUL can engage in, by developing stuff such as L\u2019Observatoire - an interactive map of occupations in Brussels. They can help the political actors have instruments they can show later, in the spirit of \u2018we have your back\u2019 for new policy making.\n\nThank you Marta, Marina, Nora, David, Alex, Cassiopee, Victor and all for joining!

I do intend on following-up this post with the efforts I'm joining as a result of meeting members of this community: @winnieponcelet, my deep gratitude for introducing me to Edgeryders and the festival.\n\n+++\n\n\nOne of the certain effects that my attending the Open Village Festival was that it brought me out of my bubble.  My geopolitical/social bubble has been very specific in the last few months, even though I inherently knew that experiences of care were universal. However,  in the day-to-day, even with intention, we have operational acts to carry out, to make rapid decisions, and maximize our lean resources. As a first timer to the festival, I went in with very few expectations, but with a salient sense of hope that we could all learn from each other on how to give and receive care (sometimes tactically, sometimes organically). \n\nTo learn-contribute to a myriad of projects under the umbrella of autonomous care, I understood, in a tangible way, that whether it is mutual first aid with migrants in Serbia, Calais; collaborative civic and maker design for universal access in Milan; biohacking femme/queer bodies in Spain and beyond; working with, in, and without institutions can be liberating. Fueled by creative interventions, we can freely imagine better futures at the margins, but actuate at the present core. \n\nThere is immense beauty in that. I witnessed in practice at the festival,  parallel actors,  movements deftly furthering a shared culture of care (I recommend reading Adrienne Maree Brown\u2019s [Emergent Strategy](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html) for my frame of reference). I expected some really bright moments where there would be aha\u2019s and some other awed moments  of commonalities among the attendees. In the past, these have been magical for me for co-creation with others. What I was equally, if not more, thankful for, however, were the moments of discomfort, where I was challenged, where I had to slow down, digest, and reframe.  And I know that there were many moments in which I knew that was necessary.\n\nThe earnestness that I felt in any given room was palpable, underscored by the whole selves that we each brought to Brussels for those days, to the collective spaces, not just one aspect of our personae, a major strength, I found, in searching for resilient, multi-dimensional systems-based solutions. In a few short but intense days, I learned, we have the potential to advance and/or to expand our capacities, write new biopolitical narratives, imagine different cognitive maps,  and restructure current extractive economic systems. And with that, I am impelled to action as an individual, and now someone who is part of the ER fabric.", "created_at": "2017-11-06 19:33:48.450717", "updated_at": "2017-11-06 19:33:48.450717", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 424.6, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 3, 2915, 3433, 4063, 3362, 2580, 3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5084, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5051, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z-BjHSPgxp_DaZLznDSrfXnEFfUZliU2wpVxKxJ20ig/edit?userstoinvite=adeline.barre@gmail.com&amp;ts=566a9f0b&amp;actionButton=1#\">Start here</a>\u00a0(the link will only work if you have been invited as an editor of the shared document).\u00a0Try to do is within a few days, we are supposed to have signed it before January 1st.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/u/olgaivanovaub\">@OlgaIvanovaUB</a>, do you want to give us a deadline?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-11 15:29:21", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 11:22:53.623677", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 81, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48689, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9198, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@brooks, @jacob and myself decided to spend some time writing copy.

What are the problems of financial meltdown - we could easily spend (or waste, depending on your point of view) the whole 2.5 hour session identifying these, which would be a crucial stage if trying to design a resilient system to respond to such problems. I'm not sure we'd all agree either...\n\n3. Health? Ok I'm very interested in this, and it would be a key sector - but I feel it's slightly odd at a conference like this not to leave more room for discussion of what we understand by resilience and how we think it can be\u00a0 usefully applied as a concept. This level of detail feels like it might suffocate valuable experiences people have had regarding attempting to increase resilience / thinking about how it applies to other sectors / more widely.

If you are hanging out in Edgeryders, you are likely one of them. What we are trying to change, exactly, depends on individual levels of hybris. It can be personal habits, a city, a business, or the whole world. But, at any level, we have two decisions to make:\n\n*   **What to start**. There are many things we could attempt, but most of the interesting ones are hard. Most will fail. And our resources are scarce: we only get one or two tries every few years, at best. Which one do we pick?\n*   **When to stop**. Picture this: you have been trying to make a certain change for a couple of years. You have not completely failed: you are still standing, and making some progress. But it is not clear your succeeding, either. Your movement is gaining activists, but you are not making a dent in the issue you care about yet. Your company is viable, but it cannot afford to pay market rate salaries yet. Are you winning or losing? Should you keep at it or cut your losses and quit? \n\nI recently spent some time going through the work of [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky). He has a knack for applying tools from epistemology to real-life problems. He has some advice to offer, especially on what to start. \n\nHis argument is this: many things, in the world, are broken. But this does not mean they are also _exploitable_. An exploitable situation is one that is broken _and_ you can gain immediate advantages by fixing it _and_ no one is already trying to fix it. At least, not in the same way as you. \n\nFinancial markets are not exploitable. If you can figure out a way to \"beat the market\", others will imitate you, because this will make them money. Soon everyone will be back on a more or less equal footing. In econ-speak, markets are efficient: if there is any free energy lying around, it is easy for anyone to eat it. So, there is never any free energy lying around. Yes, you economists out there, markets are not always efficient. But this is a story for another day.\n\nPolicy errors are not exploitable, for a different reason. Imagine you figure out that the Bank of Japan is making a mistake on its monetary policy. Then what? You cannot make money by delivering a better monetary policy to the people of Japan. The Bank is a monopolist. There is free energy, but you are not allowed to eat it. \n\nSo what is exploitable? Yudkoswky's example is this: he was able to treat his wife Seasonal Affective Disorder. This is a common condition, and a treatment exists, but did not work in this case. So, Yudkowsky tried a tweak of the method that did not exist in the medical literature, and that turned out to work. He beat the whole medical profession to it. How did he pick this one fight? Well, he cares about his wife, of course. But besides that? \n\nYudkowsky thinks tractable problems are those with\n\n> a system with enough moving parts that at least two parts are simultaneously broken, meaning that single actors cannot defy the system.\n\nTwo of the broken parts in the SAD treatment are academia and academic grantmakers. Academics need to publish in the best journals, or perish. Grantmakers need to see their grants turn into publications in the best journals. Research on the effect of tweaks of existing treatments, reasons Yudkowsky, does not make the best journals. So, it is conceivable that it does not get funded: it does not happen at all. At this point he had a hypothesis: \"This tweak on SAD treatment has not been researched.\"\n\nPreliminary testing of the hypothesis was easy. A session of Googling, plus skimming a second-hand book on SAD reported nothing. At this point, Yudkowsky decided that trying his tweak was worth a shot. He spent a few hundred dollars on materials (as certain type of light bulbs), and ran a test. \n\nIn the toy model of medical research above, neither academics not grantmakers have any incentive to deviate from what they are doing. Mathematicians say the model is in Nash equilibrium. Yudkowsky calls these equilibria _inadequate_. \n\nThe situation is: only inadequate equilibria are exploitable. But only a few of them are: inadequacy is everywhere, but most of it is unexploitable. The money quote is this:\n\n> you do not generate a good startup idea by taking some random activity, and then talking yourself into the idea that you can do better than existing companies. Even when the current way of doing things seems bad, and even when you do know a better way, 99 times out of 100 you will not be able to make money by knowing better. If somebody else makes money on a solution to that particular problem, they'll do it using rare resources or skills that you don't have. Including the skill of being super-charismatic and getting tons of venture capital to do it.\n\nThe solution is to \"scan and keep scanning\" for \"winnable battles\". Warning: they are rare, not only in business but in any competitive environment. And almost always, they don't involve fixing the systems, but improving it a bit. \n\nFollowing this advice implies navigating a course between realism and ambition. You should not be modest and defer: sometimes you _can_ do better than anyone else. But you should be humble: most of the times, you cannot. \n\nThe same attitude seems useful for deciding when to quit. Most of the times, things that do not succeed fast, will never take off. But sometimes they will. You need to \"scan and keep scanning\", and decide when it is time to call it quits. \n\nI'm curious: how do _you_ choose your own battles? And how do you decide when to abandon the battlefield?\n\n(Me, I'm going to look further into epistemology)\n\n_Photo credit: Cathy Davey on Flickr.com_", "created_at": "2018-01-11 23:27:22.551442", "updated_at": "2018-01-13 18:48:48.164970", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1025, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 474.4, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4088, 3791, 2201, 3362, 4265, 3293, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6174, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6141, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In tuesday's call and the online discussion after it, \u00a0we bounced around several ideas around collectively investing in physical spaces\u00a0for sustainable co-living and co-working.\n\nWe asked: <a href=\"/t/community-call-1-creating-a-simple-offer-and-process-for-participants/6135\">what is a good membership offer that is both attractive and financially fair</a>?\n\nTo \u00a0keep the discussion concrete, we have put together a <a href=\"/en/lote6/crowdfunding-campaign\">skeleton crowdfunding tex</a>t which we then build on\u00a0together during and after today's community call.

If we all the state is willing to do that, then I can always accept money from you in return for something you want from me: worst case scenario I can't use the money for anything else, but I can use it for paying taxes and acquiring government services. That makes it safe to trade something for central bank money. Such safety is transitive: everybody knows that everybody knows that we can always use central bank currency to pay taxes, so we can all relax and accept payment\u00a0 in currency.\n\nAnd that's why - as I see it - bitcoins as they are credible small change.

I spent the last three years in more than one - a personal transition, a spiritual one, and an ecological one. Since I relocated to Brussels and [got out of my warm bubble](https://edgeryders.eu/t/i-grew-up-in-post-communism-in-a-fractured-generation-each-with-its-own-bubble/9369), I have been living communally with 3-4 people at a time, in a shared house in Brussels, with @alberto, @Nadia, more recently @winnieponcelet, and with many from the edgeryders network staying in our guestroom or using the office space (@Alex_levene, @bridget_mckenzie, @natalia_skoczylas, @Johncoate, @matthias, @matteo_uguzzoni).  Some of us call this community house The Reef.\n\nWhen I moved in I was 29, at a point in my life when I was asking myself what is out there, post-careerism and post-ambitions from my 20s. I was also nearing a [textbook millenial burnout](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work).\n\nI actively looked for hobbies. I tried meditation and even went on a silent 10 days retreat, but the habit of sitting quietly with myself didn&rsquo;t quite stick. I began practicing yoga, and to this day I am mentally healthier because of it. I took French classes intensively, volunteered for a film festival, all to keep myself busy. I was taking long walks in the city (min 3km daily), and went on a bunch of hikes with [Brussels Hiking Group](https://www.meetup.com/brussels-hiking-group/) (night hikes highly recommended!). Cars were definitely out of my life.\n\n## I cared about food around the house as much as anyone raised in a modest household would. There, shopping extravaganzas and waste were simply unaffordable.\n\nBack in Cluj, my hometown, @ponyo and I were organising [community dinners](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-we-hosted-a-food-waste-combat-community-dinner-and-why-its-time-to-make-it-a-habit/765) with wasted food. So while in Brussels, I made sure the household food waste was kept at a minimum, by installing a simple rule of thumb: if you find leftover food in the fridge, just eat it!\n\nTaking the [Plastic Free July](https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/) worldwide challenge was an opportunity to map places where you can buy in bulk in the city - not just food, but also detergents and cosmetics. Even if the bulky products have their own carbon footprint by the time they reach the shop containers, I figured I at least contribute to decreasing the amount of waste after buying. Some of the habits I learned that July stayed on (reusable drinking bottles, travel eating kits etc), but it continues to be a challenge.\n\nI met and befriended @Puja, a wonderful lady who makes her own toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner! She came to visit and brought not only recipes for natural cosmetics (to my shame, I&rsquo;ve yet to try them), but also the first plant at The Reef after the primordial tree: a geranium which I didn&rsquo;t think would last a week in my care, but it&rsquo;s been alive and kicking to this day. Over time, our courtyard which was anything but a garden got plenty of gifts: Flemish and Portuguese apple trees, strawberries, we planted mint and other herbs, and even Georgian kiwi trees! By 'we' I mean anyone who would be around the house and cared to join.\n\n![Bread%202|690x410](upload://q734pJvGbEAtIJTsGtYOcSI7AYQ.jpeg) \n_One of my better trials with sourdough bread._\n\nIt is from Puja that I learned how to make sourdough bread, and kept learning at a workshop at @Yannick&rsquo;s [Fermenthings](https://www.fermenthings.be/), highly educational space. With inspiration from other friends I also started fermenting kefir, kimchi, kombucha (this one didn&rsquo;t stick as a routine), and the good old Eastern European pickles. Or trying :-) The biggest surprise was stumbling upon a way to produce daily healthy protein food and become more of a vegetarian than flexitarian! Enter tempeh: magic, all-and-any fermented beans (original tempeh is just soybeans) turned into hyper versatile protein cakes. With a grain mill, a DIY incubator and other tools, my partner and I are deep into learning and producing our own good protein and staple food. Tempeh is now a major hobby, rewarding us both intellectually and practically.\n\n![Green%20Transition66|690x388](upload://4Iatz5n1v8OOq9YmNPQWYFSsUtr.jpeg) \n_Batches of fresh tempeh for the week. Still looking to somehow replace the plastic production bags [sigh]_\n\n## With hindsight, I can say that a greener lifestyle came about as therapy for me. I didn&rsquo;t change because I fundamentally cared about the environment, but because these small actions were contributing to my everyday sense of wellbeing.\n\nWithout Ponyo, Puja, Yannick, other activist friends like @irene_1 and @orangeon, the learning curve would be harsh. Others at The Reef house are also exercising daily, biking, eating healthy, lining up reusable glass jars in our kitchen, light electricity saving i.e. turning off the lights, or choosing land travel over flying. At no point did we start with a common plan for energy or resource saving beyond the obvious economies of scale to reduce our cost of living (1 laundry machine for all, 1 cleaning service for all, 1 shared office, and so on). But over time we are becoming collectively more ecological. This happens when you are in a crowd: it only takes one person to care about something, and if the value of it is net positive, others will jump on board.\n\n## **From a drop in the ocean to the next Edge?**\n\nMany people I know do small things to contribute to the fight for the environment, even though, let's face it, our impact is tiny tiny.

There are two kinds of outputs, one material and one immaterial (\"leisure\"). Changes in the level of material production influence the demand for the immaterial good.  \n\nThis would be a paper based on computer simulations. There are two traditions to build on: that of classical economics and macro models such as the Goodwin model (dynamic, aggregate), and that of agent-based models (dynamic, not aggregate). \n\n@mstn has already done some great job on the Goodwin model.

They talked abou another app called Blexplorer for Android\n\nBut the FR51 chip, also used in beacons, is available in the prototyping board, can so be programmed to, for example, transmit a customized URL to the proximity devices.\n\nThey used <a href=\"http://Developer.mbed.org\" target=\"_blank\">Developer.mbed.org</a>, (registration required) and then imported the project named\n\n\"ble_physicalweb\" (note: NOT update libraries). The source code could be updated to transmit a custom URL or anything else.\n\nThen the workshop focused on the use of the WebIDE feature in Firefox (some focus on \"Permissions\" and \"Adjust CSP)\n\nMore info available at the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Assembly:Mozilla\">Mozilla assembly at \\#32c3</a>.\n\n[photo: one of the board tested during the workshop, <a href=\"/u/msanti\">@msanti</a>]\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-29 07:18:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.730562", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 323, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5118, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 5085, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Out of virtuous (I like to believe so) serendipity, I have come to be involved in the Master course mentioned in the title.

We will analyse some of the historical moments of change of medicine and human health, and some of the most notable failures to innovate.

This might seem counterintuitive \u2013 if there was a need for something like UE in Estonian society (and in many others, as you point out, including my native country, Italy), why dissolve it and destroy the capacity that had been built?\u00a0In fact, according to your account, capacity was not destroyed, but embedded in the personal\u00a0experience, world view and toolkit\u00a0of the individuals that participated in it. This seems to force a more problematic approach to how to carry forward UE's vision: some people go into politics, others into civil society activism, others still retreat to detox themselves from power logics. This is way healthier than saying that the legacy of UE lives on in a formal organization called UE, and prone to all sorts of capture, distorted incentives and perversion of what Charlie Stross calls corporate politics.\n\nFor some time now, in a different context, I have been obsessed with \"time bombs\" on government projects. I try to design one into everything I do, to prevent capture and entrenchment when the founders move on and something originally new and cool is \"bureaucratized\" by the host structure. Of course I am not against institutionalization (Edgeryders itself, originally a Council of Europe project, has spinned off into a civil society initiative), it's just that I think it should be a little hard:\u00a0there should be a natural selection process that only keeps things worth keeping.\n\nI wonder if there are any other examples of provisional-by-design political organizations out there?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-07 09:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.356596", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 303, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [22], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31938, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 5121, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>yes, ok, why not?</b>\n\nRather than a full bio, I'll outline a particular infuriating pattern which runs through many of my professional failures: <strong>saying yes</strong>.\n\nIn many situations I've taken a job or helped out on a project where I really, really should have said <strong>no</strong> - or I could have easily saved myself much trouble with a '<strong>yes, but...</strong>' or '<strong>maybe, but...</strong>'\n\nBut in other cases, there's really only one appropriate response: '<strong>fuck no</strong>.'\n\nAnd yet, over, and over again, I found myself saying '<strong>yes, sure</strong>'. Usually these were low-paid projects offered at times of desperation. The rent had to be paid, no other offers were on the table. But looking back I can't understand how I said yes to some of these.\n\nIn 2008, I had no computer, but I needed one to make music videos... so I said <strong>yes</strong> to editing 14 episodes of a horrendous, moronic reality TV show mostly revolving around tanks, cleavage and explosions. What I got for this was a hundred bucks per episode, a lesson in misogyny, and the use of the edit suite during any downtime (there wasn't much downtime). I only managed to make one music video during this period.\n\nAnd now, as much as I'd like to forget it, guess what comes up first when you <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&amp;q=Sam+Muirhead&amp;s=all\">search me on IMDB</a>?\n\nI said <strong>yes</strong> to editing a low-budget bilingual 'Idol' show called Maorioke, I said <strong>yes</strong> to shooting a 3am gig by a trash-techno band called 'the dead crackwhores in the trunk'. And then I still said <strong>yes</strong> to helping on their dreadful music video. Only a couple of years ago I said <strong>yes</strong> to a 2-hour instructional video about building 3D printers. After 5 months of underpaid, overworked struggle, it was published. 6 months later I received my first royalty letter. We sold 52 copies. As it turns out, my pay had been an advance - I still need to sell another 650 more courses just to pay the company back their few hundred Euro. Nobody is buying the course, and they didn't let us use an open license, so we can't even give it away.\n\nI've wasted months and months and months of time and energy working on useless crap over the years, and it's agonising knowing I could have avoided so much in the fraction of a second it takes to say '<strong>no</strong>.'\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-18 17:47:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.556626", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 463, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3025], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41780, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8077, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Welcome, @anncassano!

But I can't shake off the feeling that it's a one-off. Only a small part of the workforce has the will and the power to detach themselves from a traditional workplace. The power has to do with large swaths of the economy being dominated by a culture of control, where bosses want to see people at their desks. The will has to do with being prepared to give up the informal \"watercooler networks\" where deals and alliances are made. \n\nNevertheless, people with both the will and the power exist, and they will make a scheme like Vermont's successful. Those people will move to Vermont. But what if Costa Rica tries the same thing? Will there be another cohort of people in that position? Or will people in Vermont decide that Costa Rica is sunnier and cheaper, and what the hell? Or will the Costa Rican scheme simply fail? \n\nAs part of my interest for co-housing spaces, [I spent some time in Bali, in a space called ROAM](/t/6072). Like many such, it caters to digital nomads: people who write code for, say, BNP Paribas's IT department, and commit to the company's codes repos. Why would they not work from remote? And as long as it is remote, why not move to Bali, rather than coding from an expensive Paris apartment?\n\nThe people in ROAM understood that everybody wanted them. With a Paris or  New York City's salary, and being so mobile, they were *very* welcome in most middle- and low-income countries, and even in less central parts of highly developed countries. So, they made it count. They would trade expat tips: \"with my salary, I can afford a villa in Bali, but I could have a mansion in Vietnam\", this sort of stuff. They were building lives predicated on local cheap labor to make their Margaritas and give them massages, and made no mystery of their preference for such labor  to stay cheap. \n\nI do hope that I am wrong, and that you are right to be optimistic.

Furthermore, services designed and deployed by skilled communities of hackers are likely to be very different from those provided by the state and the private sector.

We identified the main ones as follows:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Collective intelligence: how can a community function as a knowledge engine?</li>\n\n<li>Domain expertise on care: how can communities interface with the academic debate\u00a0on what constitutes care and how it should be done?</li>\n\n<li>Design: how can we bring state-of-the-art design for sustainability and service design\u00a0practices into designing care provision?</li>\n\n<li>Open hardware: how can rapid prototyping and open hardware platforms be used in\u00a0the participatory design of care services?</li>\n\n<li>Public policy design and evaluation: how can community-driven care services be\u00a0integrated in the highly sensitive, highly regulated landscape of European care provision?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<em>In order to enquire about partnering with OpenCare related activities contact nadia@opencare.cc</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-26 10:54:25", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:28.395812", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 351, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13650, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>me too!</b>\n\nHi James, Lcyanna (and also Alberto, who speaks again about uncertainity, as he did commenting a similar post posted by me :D )\n\nI perfectly understand your feeling, and James one.

Kai lives in the paddie rice fields! Not being able to visit this community is the only thing I regret from this trip.\n\n\u2026. Like them, many more! I would be happy to volunteer a couple hours a week into any of these projects, if they will have me. \n\nThis is a group where everyone welcomes new people with arms open and so warmly, that they/ we forget to be new. I liked that there was no distinction between newcomers and old timers, some cosmetic match making to make those of us who were new become more at ease. It came naturally, leaving room for new dynamics. I believe that to be healthy for any group. I had access to conversations that may or may not be of direct relevance to me, but if anything, time is what we had during the week to debate intellectually, but also to chat away :-) \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f39c1ade16e50b22fb322e3a114ecdde166b35f6.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n_ @shravan, @rynseq, @Caitlin, @Puja!  _\n\nI have to brag about new friends. Puja is going to teach me to make natural soap and toothpaste, and Shravan will host us in Chennai, south of India, in one of his gazillion projects. We only need an excuse to work together.\n\n## That kind of leadership.\n\nWe had with us a leadership coach, the lovely Wouter from [Transformation First](https://transformationfirst.asia/), who said something that I particularly cherish. We grow into leadership roles through repeated practice: \n\n> \u201cYour authentic self may have parts that you don\u2019t know, which come to you from the outside in.\u201d \n\nI noticed that some NELIS members have a cultivated inner orientation which guides their work. It\u2019s hard to put in words, but for a group so far spread out, these set the atmosphere. I haven\u2019t seen one instance of mind games, ego bursts or (even silently) leading from the top, which is my least favorite style. Leadership and sustainability here means **doing good work, while remaining very connected to the essence of being human.** I suspect that not at all coincidentally, NELIS\u2019s birth in Japan takes from its oldest (non-dogmatic) religion, [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto): communion with nature and sincere hearts. Peter David @PDP, one of the founders of the network whose leadership style I cherish very much, manages to infuse this attitude from the initial group, and it carries through: \u201cWe need to make it sustainable for ourselves, otherwise we will burn out\u201d. Thanks for that.\nFinally, the connection to nature. The walkshop with Adam Fulford at the Meiji Shrine and the \u201ceternal forest that recreates itself\u201d with no man\u2019s effort was extraordinary. The other forest we walked in, near Karuizawa, I suspect could well be one of those [healing](https://healingforest.org/2017/03/26/7-healing-forests-from-japan/) Japanese forests.\nNeither NELIS, and surely not Japan, are something to figure out in haste. Time has a precious role here, and I look forward to see where this goes and return to Japan.\n\nP.S. special thanks to Jovin @hkjovin: I owe you one. Happy that you thought of me for this.\n\n_My first, more pragmatic post about my immersion in the NELIS network of sustainability leaders - [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-nelis-journey-in-japan-i-co-designing-a-networked-organization/8782)._", "created_at": "2018-07-06 16:00:49.472732", "updated_at": "2018-07-20 10:02:59.490468", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1029, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 399.0, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4085, 4539, 2915, 4566, 4, 3362, 4587, 4040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10717, "user_id": 720, "topic_id": 1520, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Every round has been extremely different </b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery round has been extremely different from one another which means that the players have the power to transform the game themselves and also this has given us the necessary feedback to evolve it.\n\nThe two main points that I would like to highlight are\n\nFirstly, the more specific the role of the players (ex.

She nodded minutely. \n>\u201cThat\u2019s what capital markets are for,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a plan for profitably using an asset someone else isn\u2019t using, then you draw up a business plan and take it to investors. If you\u2019re right, one of them will fund you\u2014maybe more than one.

(later Etcetera) are Jacob's opponents in this discussion. Their main argument is that the people who could do something with the abandoned Muji factory have no money to buy the factory. This leads to unsatisfied needs _and_ unused manufacturing capacity: a situation similar to that described by Keynes's [theory of effective demand](http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/employment-theories/keynes-theory-of-employment-concept-of-effective-demand-with-diagram/6213) (but not identical: Keynes has in mind a situation in which unused _labour_ and unmet need coexist). \n\nHowever, Keynes's theory is a short term one. In the long run, neoclassical economics has argued, prices of things (like unused factories) and of credit will adjust until the \"useless\" capacity is scrapped, and the \"useful\" one finally sold to someone who will use it. Jacob makes exactly this point:\n\n> \"Oh, please. Private property is the most productive property. Temporary inefficiencies don't change that.\"\n\nBut Natalie and Etcetera are not interested in discussing inefficiencies:\n\n>\"Only kleptokrats use terms like 'temporary inefficiencies' for wasteful abominations like that Muji factory.\"\n\nNatalie sees the Muji factory story as one of artificial scarcity, and artificial scarcity requires an agent that creates the scarcity. In other words, it is a story of power, not of economic exchange between equals. With this passage, _Walkaway_ disposes of mainstream economics altogether. Its economies (both in default and in walkaway) can not be described as a special case of the [neoclassical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics).", "created_at": "2018-07-06 18:43:00.115373", "updated_at": "2018-07-19 09:30:10.620740", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 544, "wiki": false, "reads": 59, "score": 1116.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46130, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 8769, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"noemi, post:9, topic:8769\"]The information you have in the beginning will be the one you input in Project Overview, Budget and Revenues (=predicted money? from what I understand).[/quote]\n\nYes \u2013 into Overview, Budget, Expenses and Revenues.

It's ok to enter them / correct them as more information comes in, but yes, whatever is available at the beginning of a project should be entered already.\n\n[quote=\"noemi, post:9, topic:8769\"]Is it the info in Chart Data type sheets that ultimately should go in the predictor in Magic Spreadsheet?[/quote]\n\nRather the info in the \"Expenses\" and \"Revenues\" sheets of all spreadsheet files of our projects.
