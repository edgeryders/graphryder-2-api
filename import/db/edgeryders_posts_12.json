And can bring in a network of people also doing relevant work to share their own experiences and discuss them with others.  Then collaboratively interpret the findings from the SSNA - Semantic Social Network Analysis. The data is open, the findings are open, software is opensource, platform is based on Discourse. Anyone welcome, all they need is an email address.\n\nThe participants who go through the Internet of Humans process get invited to the matchmaking event happening in Brussels this fall in time for the next round of collective applications for larger pots of financing. \n\nIncluding but not limited to the next round of Horizon 2020 applications, this is the process:\n<br>\n\n![59|690x224](upload://juuE6eFKoQ3jbFE8KxYJLCnUqlJ.png) \n\n\n\n## What the fellows do:\n\nThe fellow contacts people who they think are relevant/should be in this conversation and reaches out to them. The fellow then produces a shortlist of people who are interested in participating in the IOH collaborative discovery, sensemaking and matchmaking process as outlined above. \n\nWe try to make it simple for the people you get on board: you give us a list of names of people who you as a Fellow have reached out to so that they are on board and know to expect an email from Edgeryders. An Edgeryders team member then calls them and has long in-depth conversation/deep interview. The team member edits transcript/notes from the call it into a skeleton post with a first-hand perspective of the person interviewed. They review the skeleton, make edits and then post under their own name on the platform. They then respond to questions in the comments. They also read 2-3 posts submitted by peers also doing interesting work, and leave thoughtful comments with questions, key information, deeper reflections to help move the thinking /conversation forward.\n\nThe whole thing all ends with a collaboratively built community event.  \"Collaborative\" as in: every individual proposes to host a session on something they want to learn, teach or build. Session proposals get developed/refined through P2P input.  The event sessions are documented online, conversations follow after the event and they are processed into reports here on the Edgeryders platform. In the run up to the event we all help to bring people to the table who can in turn help further participants with their own work (based on their session content). In the form of Matchmaking and proposal building sessions we help people generate high quality concept notes and meaningful consortia for EC funding and other opportunities for collective fundraising.***\n\n## List of Fellows\u2019 deliverables:\n\n1. Participate in one physical event in Brussels at the beginning of the fellowship to learn more about the project and how to align with the work/activities the team is doing. When: End of June/early July. (t.b.c with team &amp; fellows)\n2. Commit to the 1-a-day: You come up with one status update with url to a high quality story, or discussion to share via your own social media account. This helps us to highlight and make it easy for new people to find their way to the best discussions, events etc in IOH. *When: throughout your fellowship.*\n3. Participate in a remote meeting/ video call/virtual cafe: Personal interview: a deeper, reflective conversation about your work with Edgeryders team and the other fellow (we have two fellows at a time). *When: by May 30 (t.b.c with team &amp; fellow)*\n4. Write your Deep Story: Incorporate what surfaced during the personal interview into a deeper, reflective post introducing your work and the path leading to it, questions you have, things you struggle with etc. Some examples: [Anthony](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519), [Winnie](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-first-month-as-an-opencare-community-fellow/6338) and [Ybe](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-bus-tour-for-a-trauma-informed-world/762),\n5. Recruit people: Give us a list of min 15 people doing interesting work relevant to the IOH/ongoing conversations on the IOH forum on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu). The people on the list are ones you have reached out to and engaged to participate in the collaborative discovery, sensemaking and fundraising process on the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu) platform. What they get: new information, structured collective intelligence and wisdom around a topic of interest to them, growing personal network, invitation to facilitated/well curated matchmaking and proposal development events organised by the Edgeryders team. Important: the people you suggest should be based in Europe or have really strong ties to the continent in terms of personal and professional network. We also ask that your list is somewhat gender balanced. The people you recruit would be committing to do the following:\n  * Come to three video calls (interview, discuss findings from SSNA, prepare event session)\n  * Post their own story and respond to comments posted on it\u2026\n  * Read and leave thoughtful comments on stories of others ( contributions should be thoughtful &amp; rich: have to have value added for both participants and the team in terms of new information or perspectives to further the thinking/learning with quality).\n  * ideally, they would also do one session in a final event, but this is not necessary.\n6. Write six Internet of Humans Dispatch posts: Follow the conversation on the platform and highlight key contributions and insights emerging from it in a post. \n7. Participate in a remote meeting/ video call/virtual cafe: Discussion of findings from ethnographic-coding /SNNA analysis. *When:* TBD\n8. Participate in a remote meeting/ video call/virtual cafe: To propose/develop one theme/track for the final IOH event weaving together key threads and a cluster of people/participants.\n9. Co-write introduction to the event and detailed description your own event track in the Program for the final event. *When:* TBD\n10. Participate in one physical event at the end of the fellowship to present your findings and hand over the reigns to the next batch of fellows.\n11. Wrap up fellowship with one thoughtful post summarising fellowship experience, what you got out of it and your own recommendations for next batch of fellows to move the collective IOH experience &amp; community forward. *When:* TBD\n\n**The bursary &amp; travel support:**\n\n* We have a total of 6 fellowships to award at 10,000 EUR per fellow. Payment is done in tranches against submission of listed deliverables. \n* Each fellow is eligible for 400 Eur in travel support. Up to this amount in total is reimbursed to the fellow with due justification *prior to incurring the expense*, and is reimbursed after the travel has been conducted against receipts (with VAT) and documentation (written description of purpose of travel and what was learned/achieved as a result in a post on the platform).\n\n_**The duration of the fellowship is 6 months.**_\n\n## The Paperwork/administrative process we need you to follow:\n\n**Step 1. We send you a Contract**\n\nYou are sent the draft your contract. You Read it through and if you agree, let the research coordinator @Marina know. She will invite you and @Alberto, the research director, to sign it digitally via SignRequest.\n\n**Step 2. Time tracking**\n\nAt the end of agreed period you need to report your time and describe the activities. To do this, we use the FreeAgent software. Ask us to create an account for you.\n\nGo to \u201cWork \u2192 Time Tracking\u201d. You have now three options to proceed. In all cases, select the work package as the FreeAgent \u201cTask\u201d to which your worktime belongs. This is mandatory according to the reporting requirements we have.\n\n* **Option 1** : Select project and task and click \u201cStart Timer\u201d. This will use FreeAgent as a time tracker. To stop tracking, click on the \u201cpause\u201d button that appears next to your newly created timeslip.\n* **Option 2** : Select project and task; fill in the worktime field and if necessary the date. Click \u201cAdd Timeslip\u201d (the \u201cStart Timer\u201d button changes its function when you add a worktime figure). This allows to record the worktime for a single day.\n* **Option 3** : Click \u201cAdd Weekly Timesheet\u201d. This allows to efficiently take over your worktime tracking from another tracking application, and may be your preferred choice if you are already using one.\n\nAdd a comment: a few words as to what you used the time for, referring to tasks and deliverables as much as possible. You can also add a link to what you produced, if applicable. For this, use the comment field at the bottom of the timeslip form.\n\nInform Marina that you finished reporting time for a certain period. She will export your timesheet.\n\n**Step 3. Invoicing (you do this twice during your fellowship)**\n\nCreate your invoice. The time reported needs to correspond to the amount allocated for your work. Our standard hourly rate is 41,86 eur. To create the invoice you can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTZl6ZC-zJSDsQY9-sdmGkv762ECcI5HytktNk9cshE/edit).\n\nSend your invoice to Marina. She will attach it to the exported timesheet, invite you to sign using SignRequest and import it back to FreeAgent to request the payment.\n\n***Important to know about the IOH matchmaking and collaborative proposal writing/fundraising !!!***\n\n*The people who participate have to do the actual work of putting together the proposals - we just save them time and money they would otherwise have to throw into the process of trying to participate in EC funding bids. The work has to start months ahead of time, with someone at their end committing to a structured process and taking responsibility for ensuring that their organisation respects everyone else\u2019s time - by e.g submitting their parts in a shared document that is curated by someone who knows what they are doing*\n\n*Our initial point of departure is EC funding applications for the next batch of Horizon2020 applications. That said, the process we have designed is intended to feed into other community submitted opportunities.\n\n*People who have participated in previous Edgeryders run collective discovery and sensemaking processes have continued to build on the relationships formed.

It was a very candid discussion we had - so these voters are not hiding anymore. I'll try to make a small interview with him, if that fails, I'm thinking of making a writeup of our conversation here (flawed and as I remember it, but it hits some key points).  \n\nWhat do you think, @Jan ?\n\nMoreover, I have been informally tracking the right people for us for the Czech and Serbian team and I have a bunch of wonderful candidates.

My interlocutor comes from Rzesz\u00f3w, a Polish Tiger-city, which grows rapidly due to smart politicians since more than a decade - but he seemed to be especially happy about the last 3-4 years, and stressed it multiple times. He is happy to see Eastern Poland covered by national media more than ever in the past years. Roads are not even that interesting to him anymore - roads are the most important element of the previous government anyway, I'd say. What's interesting is the availability of jobs and a decent standard of living they give. \n\nWe also talked about 500+, and he stressed the fact that almost half of it is paid back to the state in various taxes. he strongly believes this gives people dignity and strengthens the economy, as the money gives people more purchasing power. \n\nI asked him, in the light of these changes, how does he feel about trading these improvements for a white, closed, Polish and Catholic country. he said he would be happy to agree on \"selected\" migrants - not just anyone. And then he quoted the very obvious: it's really worrying to see all of these young males fleeing their countries, what are they thinking? Leaving families and homes behind? If I was there, I'd stay and fight. \n\nWhen we started talking about the risk of dismantling the free speech and other democratic rights, and the constitution, he didn't have a strong opinion. I gave him a small warning, to stay alert and be careful what these empowering changes are being attached to. \n\nAfter that and a couple of other talks I had, mostly with my highly opinionated activist team in eastern Poland, I can see there essentially is one pretty obvious reason for what's happening in Poland at the moment. The way we changed the system in the 90's and the place we gave the working classes in the new society and economy is key here. Lower classes were ignored and laughed at for decades now - a shock after worker-loving socialism. I don't think this is what they imagined will happen to them when they fought for freedom and democracy, and I was lucky to conduct two interviews with people who shared some interesting insights about that shift, which I will soon share. It's probably comparable to other super-capitalist countries, where cities with their well-off middle and upper classes dictate what success is, capture the public imagination, create the cult of higher education and white collar jobs, calling everyone else a loser. Many people really bought the narrative that if you didn't succeed in these conditions, you deserved your fate. PiS is changing this narrative. And it's huge - it creates space for solidarity and rethinking of social relations, and changes the way we perceive social welfare - somewhat a taboo after the '89 in Poland. Of course, it can't be done on PiS' terms - their politics are still venomous and divisive, and their arguments simplicistic and dangerous, but they're tapping into burning problems of our society.!", "created_at": "2019-05-22 06:57:30.039394", "updated_at": "2019-05-29 10:14:03.773053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 867, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 162.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3, 1856, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88098, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14983, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-12-03 10:13:07", "updated_at": "2020-12-03 10:17:23.979768", "deleted_at": "2020-12-03 10:31:58.868600", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4968, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 4935, "post_number": 1, "raw": "LOTE 5 4th COMMUNITY CALL\n\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.8px; position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis week agenda:\n\n- ticket policy\n\n- development campaign launch\n\n- brainstorming supporting partners + people to get in contact with\n\n- LOTE5 one pager proposal\n\n- See more at:\u00a0<a href=\"/en/lote5/task-5523#sthash.lD9in2QF.dpuf\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/task-5523#sthash.lD9in2QF.dpuf</a>\n\n</div>\n\nLet's push \\#lote5 forward and discuss where we take the\u00a0<em>fail unfail</em>\u00a0themed LOTE5. 12th of November at 10:00 a.m. either join us at Edgespace Brussels (Rue Pierre Decoster 75, Forest) or online here:\u00a0<a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/3m2tf7cn34xww45rkij2mab5rqa\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/3m2tf7cn34xww45rkij2mab5rqa</a>\n\nThis week agenda:\n\n- Registration/Join the Team adjustments suggested by Antiheroes\n\n- Supporting partners updates\n\n- Speakers/Participants/Partners updates\n\n- Development track launch\n\n- Twitter feed setup\n\n- Ticket policy round II\n\n- Logo choice?\n\nLooking forward!\n\nDate: 2015-11-12 09:00:00 - 2015-11-12 09:00:00, Europe/Paris Time.\n\nURL: https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/3m2tf7cn34xww45rkij2mab5rqa", "created_at": "2015-11-10 12:42:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:28.465224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 407, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59613, "user_id": 5252, "topic_id": 10765, "post_number": 15, "raw": "\nMaybe there is a balance between advertisment and setting a milestone from which every one will be able to gather ppl and $$ around the project.\n\nProposals to reassemble this puzzle : \nThe pitch could begin page 2 from its title to the paragraph on \"the reef cannot stand alone.\"\nFirst page of this doc is golden material to create visuals for large audiences and nourrish the first pages of any kind of dossier to advocate for the reef whoever is the interlocuteur.\n\nThen, on the second page, the 2 last paragraphs are made 4 investors, its true. \nI guess they could be splitted to keep focus on the core half a page, edgy part of all this note.

Title is provisional._\n\n## **What is it?**\n\nA curated deep inquiry into the most urgent challenges faced by cultural and art collectives across European cities. It aims to offer hosts and participants a local/global platform for conversation and access to useful information and support which tends to be unavailable or expensive. For six months, one question per month will convene artists, activists, cultural workers to a local meetup (a community space, a cafe, or even a living room) where they will engage in constructive conversation and draw points of action for mutual support and collaboration at the equivalent of 3 hours / person / month. The meetups are synchronized to address complementary issues.\nMembers of the Edgeryders Culture Squad take turns to produce and document the events, connect the local stories into a bigger narrative, and connect participants with resources from our network of thousands of people doing cultural work.\n\n## **Conversations Format**\n\nAn afternoon/evening at a table conversation with 12-15 participants.\n\n1) Invited guest introduces the inquiry and launches reflection points for the room.\n2) Participants offer their personal experience and asks for help as contribution to the theme.\n3) The group works together to build a set of actions for collaboration that require no more than 3 hours of work and service by each person who wishes to remain connected to the group. \n4) Hosts document the discussion into online posts and commit to connect it to other city events.\n5) *Dinner and drinks\n\n**The first season of Networked Culture Conversation culminates with a community event: A Performative Dinner to share key findings and celebrate outcomes as we plan for the future.**\n\n## Example deep inquiry: What is the secure urban place for an artist to work from? \nThis relates to material infrastructure i.e. access to urban space and buildings; cost and availability of studios to (co-)work from; how the City and key policies affect the ability to work and perform, and many others to be decided.\n\nOthers: \nHow can \u201cauthorship\u201d in the arts marry collaboration? \nWhat is the Edge of collaboration in art and science? \nHow to expand local work into real international collaborations?\n\n## Benefits for participants:\n\n* Join a process for discovering progressive ways to improve your work in Culture and the Arts!\n* Receive high quality materials about the solutions others have found in their city\n* Your project and plea featured in a global community of 4500+ like-minded and supporting peers working in culture, on https://edgeryders.eu/culture-squad \n* An invitation to join our Performative Dinner in one of the cities, closing the first season of our conversations.\n* Good food, drinks, and dinner talks.\n\n## Benefits for hosts and producers:\n\n* Build a tight community and make it a resource for new work, projects, collaborations \n* Become a cultural network node in your city.\n* Learn about community building using an online platform and digital conversation techniques\n\n\n## Where? \nOur very early stage proposed cities to start with would be:\n\nIn Brussels: The Reef, CineMaximiliaan\nIn Berlin: TBC \nIn Bedford: The Place Theatre community venue\nIn Timisoara: Ambasada / Faber creative re-converted industrial spaces\nIn Athens: Technopolis?\n\n## How do we start?\n\nA member of the Culture Squad partners up with an embedded, active local group or organisation and asks them to co-host the event. They formulate together the deep inquiry and propose a list of invitees and participants, roll out the invite (with request to register to the Culture Squad - mailing list or signup on edgeryders.eu), meet people and document on edgeryders.eu what comes out of the conversation.\n\n\n**Project lead**\n\nThe Edgeryders Culture Squad is connecting groups across Europe and beyond to develop shared practices and deploy art and culture for social change. Due to our geographic spread and using an international community platform, we make it cheap for people to connect in new ways and access (funding) resources together. \n\nOur main work: production of co-created community festivals; nurturing a new generation of urban game designers who use play as a tool for social cohesion; training cities and organisations to build thriving communities using online/offline methodologies.", "created_at": "2019-02-26 10:28:49.278510", "updated_at": "2019-02-27 13:52:12.850917", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 699, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 270.6, "like_count": 10, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 2201, 4865, 5, 4, 4448, 137, 4265, 4945, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6693, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5222, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Collaborative real-time note taking</b>\n\nHello <a href=\"/u/kaja\">@Kaja</a>, thanks for this.

There are many such tools: Google Docs, PiratePads, TitanPads etc. They are all OK, though ideally it's best to use just one for the whole conference.

For context, I worked for several years as an SEO consultant. @matthias, I think this is of interest to you, since you seem to be handling the website.\n\nI did a very fast SEO audit of the website.\n\nIssues:\n\n1. The site is indexed in Google but doesn't come up as one of the results on the first 2 pages in google for search terms like \u201dthe reef Brussels\u201d or \u201dthe reef edgeryders\u201d.\n\n2.

On the main page, the word \u201dBrussels\u201d comes up only one time, somewhere at the bottom. Make sure to include it in more proeminent places, like subtitles.\n\n5.

She found that these organizations are welcome and can operate in these spaces with relative ease, given their open and multistakeholder nature. \n\n**At the same time, she also saw that while getting the tech \u201cright\u201d is an important part of the puzzle of human rights advocacy in the digital age, it is also a narrow frame through which to understand the broad spectrum of social concerns raised by networked technologies.**\n\nCCS\u2019s work in Internet governance also led her to consider human rights advocacy in AI governance, as AI systems are raising a host of questions regarding privacy, safety, anti-discrimination and other human rights.\n\nOne of the problems with developing AI advocacy programs is that many of these systems are developed by private companies, so it is difficult to gain access to their technology to examine and understand it. Many NGOs are therefore calling for the regulation of AI systems, but are facing pushback, with companies arguing that it hampers innovation. Yet, it is this same \u201cinnovation\u201d that encourages many governments to deploy AI systems. \n\n**A drive for \u201cinnovation\u201d for innovation\u2019s sake is particularly concerning when it encourages governments to step into technologies that they don\u2019t fully understand or even need.**\n\nObviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about these various dynamics for a while and are consistently raising their concerns\u2014 sometimes by bringing in academic work to show some of these issues. Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as does Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they\u2019re also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. \n\n\n> \"How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact?

In the language of economists, you describe market failures (in \"What\u2019s holding us back\"). You then proceed to recommend fixes (in \"The 3 things that need to change\"). Two out of the three you mention qualify as competition policy (they make it harder to attain and hold dominant positions) and make plenty of sense. The third one, about VCs, is less straightforward, and I'm afraid it plugs back into value theory. That does not mean you are wrong, only that it is less obvious from a textbook economics point of view. \n\nI really like the idea of \n\n[quote=\"BlackForestBoi, post:1, topic:10221\"]\nforming a community of people to map out all those challenges and how to tackle them through e.g. good UX, education or privacy preserving technologies.\n[/quote]\n\nIt could be the beginning of a much needed activity to issue guidelines, set goalposts and certify companies and products. I think the folks involved in the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet initiative](https://www.ngi.eu) might look with some sympathy upon such efforts. Many people in the Edgeryders community also care about these issues, and we would like to help if we can. \n\nI find a bit less convincing that any single company be a good candidate for a long term fix. It's great that WorldBrain is experimenting with non-speculative finance, but I would not stake too much on it. Quite some innovation in governance and corporate culture have been attempted in the past (lastly the \"not evil\", progressive tech giants), and I am not impressed with the results. Of course, this time might really be different, but that's a hard argument to make. \n\nI think your \"A way forward\" section means to treat WorldBrain not as a massive fix, but as an example of the approach you would like to see. If it is so, I think it could be made clearer by bolting it on top of Things that need to change, item 2, and explaining that items 1 and 3 are a matter for public policy.", "created_at": "2019-06-25 16:54:10.716989", "updated_at": "2019-06-25 16:54:10.716989", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 353, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 78.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [55639], "is_reply_to": [55639], "is_liked_by": [8, 5191, 2915, 4560], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51106, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 9528, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi @noemi, this is a topic that I'm interested in.

Maps that connect people - this use case is satisfied to a certain extent by platforms with a social components like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Edgeryders even if you are not able to view the  map. Some other platforms like [Now What?!](https://www.nowwhat2020.com)\n![04%20PM|690x442](upload://asqeJoj95bZdcAmdgPNSpl6MyUa.jpeg) \nThese are useful as they give us a starting point for a conversation and help us understand pathways of trust to others. But the \"people map\" does not do a great job of supporting collaboration because the profiles of the connected individuals do not provide sufficient information to understand what someone is working on. \n2. Maps that connect projects - I agree with Liliana that vaping between projects is very important. They give us view into what projects are working on which is essential if we want to collaborate, coordinate, and reduce duplication of effort. The \"project map\" helps us find aligned projects, but they may not provide sufficient still requires us a \"cold\" call or  email to the people involved, which may or may not be on the map. To make project maps most useful, the profile could include things like the specifics of what is being worked on (background, methods, hypothesis), what is needed, what is offered, and how they would like to collaborate with other projects or how to get involved. \n3. Maps that connect concepts (offline) - these are commonly called mind maps. A  *mind map*  is a diagram used to visually organize information and can be siloed to the individual or worked on in a group. These types of maps are helpful for understanding concepts and ideas. \n4. Maps that connect ideas, information, and context (online) - This does not really exist except as far as I know in the [bridgit.io](https://bridgit.io) alpha. We call it a \"Collective  Knowledge map\" but would be more accurate to say that it is an interactive, self generating collective online knowledge map. The beautiful thing about this notion is that for the first time it actually enables us to think and learn together online. We think of the possibility of planetary cognition - participants create bridges between two content snippets with a relationship thus externalizing the relationships in their mind as reflected by connections between ideas they find online. The map being collective means that all participants use the same map; individuals can specify privacy for what they post (e.g., private, a specific group, public). \nThis creates the possibility of a) ubiquitous context - access to deep layers of context for any idea on the web, b) on-page presence - know and interact with others within the researcher community while on the same web page, c) democratized linking - Anyone can create deep links from/to any page, and d) Bridgit apps - organizations can expose their information and interactions on any relevant web page.     \nThis creates the possibility of people collaborating on knowledge building with coordination, but also enables the possibility of connecting \"in-context\" on the web page or \"out-of-context\" via email or direct message with people who are working with or reviewing the same information. Duplication of knowledge building efforts can be eliminated within a community that shares information and builds knowledge collectively. A solution like this requires a browser overlay which can be implemented via a browser extension, a web app, and/or a mobile app. \n\nAnyway, I hope this is helpful for the mapping conversation.

Working with small theatre companies, playwrights and local people from all walks of life, he creates documentary plays about the lives of those who stayed in the villages (mainly the elderly and uneducated). The locals are the creators of the content of the plays, which express the problems they face and what makes their lives miserable. The plays develop out of open workshops as a new form of communication. The funding for the production costs comes from municipality. Plays will be recorded and put online. The locals participate because they are lonely. Their day-to-day communications are limited to the people they know and see every day.

It can offer collaborative strategy towards (optimised) mutual actions. \n\nWhat strikes me is the technical emphasis in the study - it leaves the reader to consider design systems creating behaviour vs. design behaviour creating outcome. While targeting how to change behaviour of end-users, the latter considers how this can be done (on a different level for greater impact), altering behaviour to create favourable sustainability situations. Closely inter-linked. Perhaps, these can be thought of as (binding) parallels in techno-social exchanges. \n\nAre both aspects important in unfolding a new type of economy? \nHow can these be considered in different socio & cultural -contexts so as also to gain traction in uptake?\n\nThe study speaks about the system but not the people, still it is acknowledged that \u201ca circular economy cannot be achieved without sharing the logistical knowledge that Is presently locked up in the walled gardens of private logistics. Only by sharing each other\u2019s input and output can partners in an open ecosystem adapt towards a real circular economy.\u201d For this very reason, behavioural aspects should not be overlooked or solely tackled through a systematic effort. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Further thoughts\u2026)\n\nImpressions\n\nThe P2P study provides a substantial overview of existing resources leading up towards a new type of economy (described in their conclusion). Emerging techno-social trends are supra interesting, as much as innovation radars it serves to facilitate agents towards changes in behaviour as a result of the system. While the initiatives listed are widely beneficial - it does not question the rate at which other and/or competing technologies are developed. Nor unforeseen circumstances that make build-ups for similar tools more vulnerable taken that people are ultimately and remain the primary creators & operators of tools. Technically, it is fabulous study where value is broadly discussed but the framework does not mention for whom and why (given that is taken). It does so to an extent by explaining how tools enable behaviour around commoners. Intangible assets such as humanity and relationships between human beings are central in that people are the creators and operators of functioning systems. In this sense behavioural design becomes a tool with complementary significance.\n\nShifting mindsets\n\nSchneider\u2019s description of the P2P model, as a **\u201cparadigm-making vision for** **how to flip the future of the economy right side up,** \u201d encapsulates the systematic result that influences behaviour. In its own right, the P2P report recaps a comprehensive overview of available technologies and alternative economies. On the other hand, it does this without fully addressing behavioural design: the very essence of what contributes to circulating economies, one might argue that it lacks a future-proof methodology. Individuals are the enablers and transformers of the economy. I believe that this point is understated, or at the very least vastly underestimated. The common good economy and the value flow shares livelihood, love and care are interesting concepts, accounting for value sovereignty. As mentioned in the study, recognising incentivising contributions and making participation sustainable for everyone at the very beginning of the economic process in a transparent way is essential.\n\nIn context\n\nTaken the speed of technological development coupled with social, economic and environmental issues requires attention, while simultaneously challenging people to demonstrate flexibility, learn quickly and apply the knowledge. With regard to a wider coordination and the capacity to manage a broad range of stakeholders is **pivotal** : the ability to communicate in a clear and concise manner, and work in various teams while demonstrating analytical thinking. **Human capacity** to manoeuver and leverage resources are indispensable to maintain positive outcomes, those that re-generate (reinforce) and accelerate sustainable actions across the broader spectrum. The P2P model places emphasis on the mutual, thereby encouraging an all-inclusive method. All-the-more, perceptions and perspectives matter.\n\nOn Sustainability\n\n[This article](https://behavioralscientist.org/to-achieve-sustainability-we-need-to-go-upstream-in-the-design-process/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Sustainable%20Design%2C%20Informed%20by%20Behavioral%20Science&utm_campaign=Enews%20BOTW%205/1/2020) provides an alternative (rather complementary) approach on emerging techno-social aspects, with regard to human-centric practices it discusses behavioral science as a powerful tool to direct human behaviours toward sustainable outcomes.\n\n\u201cExploring the **untapped potential** of design behavior for sustainability is the focus of a recent expert panel [report from Nature Sustainability (https://www.nature.com/documents/design_behavior_for_sustainability.pdf)\u201d\n\n\"Collaborating effectively in this way, however, is often easier said than done. **The incentive structures in each discipline and between research and practice are very different.** Even if all involved are sincerely aligned on the end goal of increased sustainability, the varied mindsets and contexts in which we work typically reward different activities and suggest different measures or proof of value.\"\n\nIt continues by stating how they as a community can influence policy and inviting others to participate. Economies of scope as mentioned in the accounting for planetary survival study could consider the cognitive enterprise of people **to maintain** flow throughout the value chain and to encourage the footings of a sound architecture for what that may be.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn contrast to emerging trends in techno-social tools, \"design of behaviour\" illuminates the contributing requisite by pinpointing that \u201cend-use behavior can determine what happens in a situation, design behavior often determines the situation itself.\u201d Where what seems like an infinite perpetual discussion around virtuous cycles towards favourable, generative activity, it is also a signal for progress.\n\nResearch initiatives are continually touching on new horizons and valuable input to revamp current and future affairs. This means that there is a market for mobilising teams to speed up support structures and accelerate uptake of favourable behaviours...

The first step is to share experiences of coping with work in a very detailed way. We have about 10 ongoing discussions (see #covid19), 2+ community calls weekly, and hundreds of chatty comments and cat videos. The outcomes are:\n\n* Learn how others are dealing with the sudden changes in their lives\n* Get inspiration for new things to do and stay optimistic\n* Clear asks for help and projects are matched with contributors and mentors who can offer support.\n\n# If even the first point checks out, we could be succeeding, because this.is.one.of.those.times.\n\nWhen work is brought to a halt, no one is lying on their back and waiting ex: for helicopter money, social security benefits. \u2018We cannot rely on any help now\u2019, says @DanicaLacarac whose own personal challenges don\u2019t stop her from wondering how to help others.. or @iriedawta telling us 'I lost all my payslips due to the corona virus. I'm lucky enough to have a security network around me that I don't have to care for rent. Overall I'm really anxious about the future. I will need to find another occupation'. \nHave you noticed that while everyone should be slowing down, it seems like many of us are pushing ourselves to do more, learn more, and get ahead of the curve? It must be exhausting, so:\n\n# people, take three deep breaths in!\n\nNow, how are we actually coping?\n\n# 1. Personal learning plans. \n@Matteo\u2019s words are similar to what I have read elsewhere online: \n> I wrote a daily routine and I\u2019m trying to stick with it, plus I made a plan with projects and things that I want to do in the next six weeks, after doing this I felt really good, self-discipline helps me usually. \n\nKnowing @jasen_lakic  little, I am not surprised that his strategy is to accelerate, keep on networking, and even teach himself how to code (designing board games is at a stall right now):\n\n\n\n# 2. Build new kinds of businesses. \n@alessandro_mambelli in Yerevan & @Yannick and Jasen in Brussels definitely think alike, if you ask me :-)\n\n> we could investigate this opportunity to look for something else we could also do. Should we? And not just to \u201cdiversify business\u201d, I really just wish this won\u2019t be yet another wasted global crisis. But[ where to start?\n](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coping-with-loss-of-work-a-postcard-from-yerevan/12952/)\n\nIn Brussels we have two major facebook groups (in Fr/ Nl languages) and already we see people propose cooperative structures to coordinate a corona relief fund with 1000eur/member from all their 2500 members. I\u2019m curious if the way to build anew is to build from scratch?\n\n# 3. Build connective platforms. \nThe many technically skilled people in Edgeryders are trying out things for social good - @mstn  attempt to set up local apps for easing access to food stores in the neighborhood; @matthias and @trythis participating in the German gov\u2019s hacking event which birthed over 1000 working [prototypes](https://edgeryders.eu/t/german-govt-holds-pandemic-relief-hackathon-this-friday-2020-03-20/12885/11). @Yassine\u2019s initiative[ in Tunisia](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-to-do-when-losing-work-during-covid19-community-calls-each-tuesday-noon/12886/17) is early days: the visitors of the site are people who seek answers to their questions or who need logistical help, as being volunteers we can even give food for those who cannot afford to buy or who cannot transport themselves.\n# 4. Ask about the ways to go on the digital curve (especially from teachers and community workers). \n\n> If you\u2019re in a rigid environment like universities, you have to find your way. We, the system, were not prepared for this challenge and had to design short-, medium- and long-term strategies right from last week, \n\nwrites @Jirka_Kocian. @Amelia similarly spoke about chaos. Community foundations in Romania have opened up about the difficulty of moving their programs online and stay true to their constituencies during the crisis, including with cashflow support. Kudos to you @Andreea @Alex_Stef @RuxandraNitu! Personally, I find this approach much more honest than what we see in other orgs: pretending that they know how to webinars since forever (sic!)\n\n# 5. Turn expertise and passion into leadership. \n\n@Alberto writes about the wonderful experience of caring for the office and co-workers at [The Reef](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-reef-vs-lockdown-living-in-a-co-housing-space-in-a-time-of-pandemic/13023/): \n> Many people appreciate going to the office, where they can socialize with colleagues and work from a space that is physically and mentally separated from the home and the family. But there is no reason to dive into traffic: you can get the same things in a remote work-ready facility five minutes walking from your door. No more commuting! \n\nOthers like @Hugi are helping translate (literally and metaphorically) situations from their own environment - why Sweden is behaving [differently](https://edgeryders.eu/t/sweden-and-covid-19-sensible-or-suicidal/13016) than the rest of the world.\n\n--------\nWhat am I missing? \nWe are not talking a lot (or not here) about being a parent in this lockdown, but I\u2019m pretty sure in so far as heroes go, parents are up there. Very funny twitter thread [#ParentingInAPandemic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ParentingInAPandemic?src=hashtag_click)! We are also not talking about burnout of remote workers. There are already interesting [articles](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200330-covid-19-how-to-learn-a-new-skill-in-coronavirus-quarantine) about that, and I would want to see what\u2019s under.

Problem je \u0161to takvi mediji uti\u010du na vokabular populacije oblikuju\u0107i ga u upro\u0161\u0107en niz glasova \u010dije zna\u010denje sami korisnici naj\u010de\u0161\u0107e ne umeju da objasne prihvataju\u0107i ga _ad hoc_. Ne ka\u017eem da svako treba da u svakodnevnom govoru ili pisanju koristi knji\u017eevni stil, ali mislim da su (opet, mla\u0111e generacije) izgubile smisao za upotrebu termina u formalnom i neformalnom opho\u0111enju. Tako se sve \u010de\u0161\u0107e mo\u017ee sresti rogobatna formulacija \"foloveri\" za jednostavnu i odavno poznatu re\u010d \"pratioci\" ili nekakva kovanica ne znam ni ja \u010dega - \"zapratiti\" (\"follow us\") i pored jasnog prevoda - \"pratite nas\".\n\nDa li je neophodno izmi\u0161ljati nove re\u010di kada ve\u0107 postoje jasne i prihva\u0107ene ili nepotrebno uzimati tu\u0111ice koje zvu\u010de bolje na\u0161em uhu (\"ofis\" umesto \"kancelarija\") iako na izvornom jeziku zna\u010de upravo ono \u0161to je na\u0161 jezik davno prepoznao. Ovome mogu dodati i da je u Srbiji nekim ljudima sporna upotreba \u0107irilice kao glavnog pisma. O\u010duvanje pisma i sopstvenog jezika upravo bi trebalo da bude jedna od osnovnih postulata evropske razli\u010ditosti ali se \u010dini da se sve \u010de\u0161\u0107e zanemaruje.\n\nP.S: Neko mi mo\u017ee zameriti \u0161to sam ovu objavu (\"post\") napisao latinicom, a ne \u0107irilicom koju sam pomenuo nekoliko redova ranije.

That is our vision. Our community culture is such that we collaboratively structure and share what we learn with anyone who needs it, whenever the need arises.\n\nRight now the priority is mobilisation around Covid19 crisis response.\n\n# An online course with the aim to cover the essentials of remote work and collaboration.\n\nDue to the crisis, many institutions, civil society organisations, companies and informal networks have an urgent need to quickly set up good remote work practices.\n\nBut Remote collaboration can be hard...\n\n* Frustrating calls where half the time is spent on \u201chello can you hear me?\u201d\n* Coworkers located elsewhere than the main office feeling left out\n* Feeling you just wasted an hour in a meeting where half the people are tuned out, checking out their email etc\n* Putting a lot of money and energy on new fancy tools to solve a problem, and later discovering that all you really needed was some features you didn\u2019t know about in the tools you already had!!\n* Assuming that your co-workers are aware of what you wrote \u2026 but you didn\u2019t know, as it was never clear who would get what notification when.\n* The awkwardness of people behaving inappropriately and causing everyone else discomfort.\n\n.... We have made all the mistakes and found good solutions so others don\u2019t have to.\n\n### In 2019, we produced a comprehensive manual on distributed collaboration in partnership with EIT-Climate Kic, Europe\u2019s largest public-private partnership for climate innovation.\n\nYou can access it here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263/35\n\nNow we are building an Open Online Course out of what we learned to make it even more accessible.\n\n## This course will make it possible for you, and many others to have effective and enjoyable distributed interactions, teams and projects combining the best of many, many worlds\u2026\n\nvideo\n\n#### What you will learn\n\nThe lessons and the learning materials will provide a mix of concrete examples, recommendations and general guidelines to make your distributed projects run smoother immediately. The general, tool independent, guidance will enable long term enjoyable and effective collaboration. It will help you to update your own work culture, systems and conventions for communication, collaboration and socializing.\n\n#### How you can access the course\n\nIf enough people share the costs involved, we can make it completely free to access for everyone who needs it! You can help make this happen in two ways:\n\n##### Make a financial contribution\n\nRight now many of us are taking a financial hit. This includes the team who have put aside everything to quickly get the course up and running as a service to us all. Whatever you can offer is much appreciated.

The program matches people leading purpose driven projects and ventures, with Mentors and skilled collaborators. The program is set up to guide participants through a step-by-step process of online working sessions with follow up tasks and personalised feedback from fellow entrepreneurs and domain experts.\n\n#### Who the program is for\n\n**Project Leaders:**\n\n* have an idea for a potentially self-sustaining project/ social enterprise/venture/\n* are in the process of validating their ideas\n* are looking for mentors, partners or any kind of support\n* willing to have shareholders, and commit to start new entreprises\n\n**Project Contributors:**\n\n* Do not have a project/venture idea, but want to invest time and skills into building new paths to generate income for themselves.\n\n**Problem Owners:**\n\n* have a problem that they care about\n* Want to be involved in developing and testing solutions to the problem\n* have some kind of leadership role in a context where the problem is very present\n* are willing to invest financial or nonfinancial resources into self-sustaining solutions that come out of the incubator\n\nProject teams that are shortlisted for the OCI LAB intense project incubation track of the program, receive dedicated mentoring and specialized technical support to move their initiatives forward We use our collective intelligence to help one another navigate the complexities of building self-sustaining solutions to social, economic and ecological challenges.\n\nWrite to [ocilab@edgeryders.eu](mailto:ocilab@edgeryders.eu) for more information about the program.\n\n\n# The Mission\n\nOur theory of change is building dense networks around people trying to tackle messy social-ecological, economic and political challenges. Having a dense network around you is one of the hallmarks of social capital, and gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing. In a dense network, there are many ways for you to get from one point to another. A key challenge here is for people with aligned interests to find each other, and as a community we\u2019re out to solve just that.\n\nUpload video: (Hugi\u2019s talk)\n\n### This is how it works.\n\nEmbed video (start at 03:35): <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/112493351?byline=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/112493351\">ZipCar founder Robin Chase on Edgeryders</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user19087695\">Edgeryders</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\nEdgeryders is a network of 5.000 people in more than 80 countries who have been sharing their stories, their ideas, their problems, and their solutions since 2013. All these posts together are what we call our \"collective intelligence\". Our data analysis team uses open source methodologies and technologies to create interactive visualisations of the conversations as they evolve. The visualisations make it easier for everyone to find and connect across common interests and new insights. The Edgeryders organisation develops and maintains these resources, methods and technologies to support the community as well as its own operations. This is all financed through revenue from research grants, consultancy and training for other organisations.\n\nThe best way to learn more about Edgeryders research, technologies or services is a video or phone call.

Sicily\u2019s economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. \n\nYet, over the past ten years or so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process. They call themselves \u201cthe Messina advanced cluster\u201d.\n\nTo get where they are now, they had to re-invent a lot of economic concepts. \n\nThe familiar ones (\u201cmaximizing shareholder value\u201d, \u201ccorrect market failures\u201d etc.) were simply not working out for Sicily, and for their goals. \nSo, as they re-built their local economy, they developed their own economic thinking, with concepts such as \u201crelational goods\u201d, \u201cstocks as autonomy\u201d,\nand \u201csystems, not networks\u201d. \n\nEven their innovation is weird: solar panels made out of the pulp of waste oranges? A People\u2019s Energy Company?\n\n**In this online event, you will learn how they built this incredible success under very difficult conditions, and how their way of thinking might help you along your own journey.**\n\n</Text>\n\n</Section>\n\n<Section style=\"padding-bottom: 6rem\">\n\n<Title>\n\n# Featured Participants\n\n</Title>\n\n<Grid columns=\"2\" data=\"14240\" />\n\n</Section>\n\n<Section style=\"background: rgba(0,0,0,0.016); padding: 4rem 0;\" id=\"register\">\n\n<Title>\n\n# Register Now\n\n</Title>\n\n<Form data=\"14549\" />\n\n</Section>\n\n<Footer>\n\n</Webkit>", "created_at": "2020-08-11 21:04:27.519260", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 00:23:09.506569", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 417, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69544, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 87, "raw": "I just got back from dinner with @MariaEuler after a long-ish chat with @hugi at the huset blivande.

As the ego network below shows, we are starting to see some themes cohere around `co-working`. Since the pandemic, there is a growing `demand` for co-working spaces, including in `rural areas` with poor `Internet connectivity.` Co-working spaces, both formal and informal, are springing up to meet the technological and social needs of `working remotely` as workers relocate all around the world. Some have had to move for care responsibilities while others are relocating to areas in search of better quality of life. Whatever the reason, in the absence of the workplace providing natural space for social interaction, remote workers are seeking `a sense of community`. Here's an excerpt that conveys this:\n\n> [why customers join our coworking space is, because they want a work environment. Work environments is also connected to community, because if you don\u2019t have more people, you don\u2019t have a work environment, you just have an empty office.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-with-human-interaction-is-the-way-of-the-future/14035)\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-04 at 2.03.24 PM|690x574](upload://KNCQIoyzdIRFtp0zTQGlfN4n3w.png) \n\nFor those operating formalised co-working spaces, their `managerial practices` of providing safe, clean, and `socially distant` working environment pose a real difficulty. On one hand, they want their services to `last for a long time` and see a real opportunity for market growth. However, with talks of the second `lockdown` and the uncertainty of social distancing guides in some countries, it is difficult to assess whether and how much to invest in operating or expanding facilities (`making investment`). For the moment, it appears that both the private and public sectors have responded to the demand for communal work spaces, but as the pandemic continues, operators are anticipating different business models for different sectors (`distinguishing between sectors`).   \n\nSome operators are turning to `technological solutions` like `apps` to monitor their facilities and regulate members' `access control`. This raises some questions about `privacy` but operators seem to find access control apps to be the most practical option for the moment. \n\n**From loss to imagination** \n\nPutting co-working in conversation with other semantic nodes (at k=4) begins to tell a complex story about how the `shift to online` is restructuring social relations: \n\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-04 at 1.58.20 PM|690x550](upload://enLL9tUv4qKTjnqxIU3qqAYZ6K5.png) \n\nFollowing the threads around work from `COVID-19` captures the double bind of having the pandemic disrupt the fabric of how we organise our working lives. On one hand, there is profound feeling of loss: the connections stemming from `shift to online` are `public space`, `social engagement`, `mental health`, and `sense of loss`. For most people, being unable to access public spaces on their own terms has severely restricted their social interaction. The loss of companionship and feeling of community is contributing to erosion in mental health. This was especially prescient with `university` `students` as their social and intellectual lives have had to move online. \n\nAt the same time, this sense of loss has also generated new opportunities as social distancing measures are propelling participants to think and act more creatively (`imagining the future` and `imagining alternatives`). More on this below. \n\n**Sharing spaces, building communities**\n\nAnother strong connection emerging is on how `sharing` `work space` is contributing to a `sense of community`. Sense of community here captures both what co-working space members' desire and what operators are doing to bring people together. \n \n![Screen Shot 2020-10-04 at 1.58.44 PM|690x411](upload://12jm7DjknphrWTkpZPGOoNgRr6.png) \n\nSharing `work space` means having to share resources and, on some level, sharing, if not negotiating, values. Unsurprisingly, sharing work spaces with social distancing measures is incentivizing many to `set boundaries`. This code emerged from participants discussing how the burden of maintaining clean space often falls on those with higher standards of cleaning. (I've been having some issues with Graphryder on my computer where some connections are sometimes not shown, as is the case with `setting boundaries` here. Will discuss this at meeting tomorrow). In one recent thread I coded, a co-working space operator talked about the challenges of organising community-building events when everyone is experiencing `'Zoom fatigue'`. Here's an excerpt from one thread:\n\n> [In the weeks immediately following the shutdown orders, we did jump on and try to make sure that all of our members were participating on Slack, or on our social media channel, and we started hosting a number of Zoom virtual meetings to check in with people and see how they were doing. But after the first few weeks it became pretty clear that most of our members actually weren't asking for more of those coffee breaks or happy hours. I think people got Zoomed-out really quickly, and we didn't want to add to that. The way that we were able to support our community was actually by backing off, and so I think that was actually really interesting to see.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-with-human-interaction-is-the-way-of-the-future/14035)\n\nHow do you bring people together when the one way to connect people is tiring them out?

Municipalities would share their problems and needs and winning teams would help them tackle these problems. \n-\tThe team has identified some data regarding people\u2019s satisfaction online. \n\n-\tAfter a collective discussion, it was recommended that the team establishes a quick win and prior to launching a hackathon, organize workshops at the municipalities. This would help them better understand the job and needs of the municipalities and identify and collect data from municipalities and communities around it. \n\n\n-\tThe second team to present was Ahmed from Egypt. Aware of the issues in their educational system, they decided to plan an event that would help students better make their career choice and guide them. They\u2019re planning on organizing a 2-days event to introduce especially tech-related fields and inspire people to help them choose their career path. \n-\tSirine suggested they make a platform, similar to StackOverflow were students could post job-related questions and get answers. \n\n\n-\tThe last person to present was Tunisia\u2019s Sirine with a 1-day hackathon for the environment. \n-\tIt\u2019s going to be an eco-friendly hackathon, where any plastic used will be recycled. \n-\tIt\u2019s holding a data science challenge, to be hosted on Zindi and the data is already available. \n-\tThey\u2019re expecting 15 participants and more data scientists will be mobilized during the event. \n\nFinally, Zmorda shared the proposal template with the team to refine their proposals until Monday and in 2 working days, we will get back to them with the final decision where two teams will be selected.", "created_at": "2019-11-17 18:10:31.207439", "updated_at": "2019-11-17 18:26:30.748395", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 492, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 109.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5688, 8, 5547], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60697, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10962, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Yes, in my mind that's suitable :) But since I'm not gonna live in The Reef, I defer judgment to the others.

Paola will be joining us in Brussels October 19-21. \nShe recently joined Creative Commons as Director of Product Engineering, designing a search engine that supports the organisation to advance culture of openness into social behavior, beyond using the licenses: \"I want to build a more usable commons, a more vibrant commons so people can benefit from its openness. This creates a virtuous cycle where people collaborate and are grateful to each other.\" \n\nPaola is joining a panel at [#OpenVillage festival]([https://edgeryders.eu/c/festival](http://festival.edgeryders.eu)). I asked her to share insights into how she and others who do programming for the greater good can finance work dedicated to solving pressing societal issues. Paola started applying for fellowships in 2014 (she was a Mozilla Open Web Fellow), and developed a personal strategy to get funding. Her experience has to do with training oneself to find out the funders' perspective and possible adjusting one's research to increase the odds to get a project supported. \n\nMore about her work: http://paw.mx/\n\nYou can hangout with Paola by joining [The Edge of Funding](https://edgeryders.eu/t/main-session-the-edge-of-funding/6427/12) on October 20th!", "created_at": "2017-09-11 07:27:12.834251", "updated_at": "2017-11-07 14:50:20.982725", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 222, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 211.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362, 4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54327, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10023, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@hugi, this is good work.

This is justified as the resulting system will also be used in some capacity for POPREBEL campaigns. Nadia had some conditions for that, which are possible to meet from the tech side. In short it's these (and the details would be discussed while we implement it all):\n\n* It should be a multi-step form with a clear, chain-like process through which the user is guided, as we had in Drupal times with the \"Challenge\" system.\n\n* During this process, users should see previews of Discourse topics from the category where their own topic will also end up in.\n\nTogether with the 1,000 EUR from the H2020 tech budget, I think we already have enough now to make this happen :)\n\n(@nadia, have a look and please confirm / correct the above if needed.)\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:36, topic:10217\"]some more technical specs[/quote]\n\nIt's true that \"we could continue on the Vue.js and Node track\" for this. It would of course need a server-side component in Node.js then that creates the Discourse account and topic via API.\n\nJust that, if I happen to manage the implementation of this, I'd not choose that approach. I installed Vue.js and tried around for a bit and I still think that it's too complex technology for a simple application like this. Also, it's a bit of an outlier in our software landscape since all of Edgeryders' custom or customized software is either Python or Ruby. So instead we'd extend the Middleman/Ruby based [framework we use for the NGI platform](https://github.com/edgeryders/ngi-forward-platform) \u2013 I used that and found it to be very compact and intuitive to work with. Since that is only a static site generator framework in Ruby, we'd have to add a Ruby-based MVC micro-framework. Not Ruby on Rails, that is already total overkill.\n\n@hugi If you also have strong opinions about what would be the \"right\" way to implement this, let's talk and find a common ground.

It's almost 40% of the domestic gross product at the moment (tourism in the Canary Islands).

We were locked down for almost three months.\u201d\n\n\n## Multi-use coworking spaces\n\n\u201cI'm also one of the founders of X which is a house of a thousand square meters in the harbor district of Stockholm, where we run a coworking space\u2026 But the thing we do that's unique for us in this sector in Sweden is that we combine this with collaborative activity studios for artist. And we also have events spaces. We organize everything from art exhibitions to parties, conferences in the daytime.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we are now also developing this Container village. We're transforming a former parking lot next door to a container-based, basically a public square. We're trying to innovate around it. And so then we also have, we're all stay the sort of hub for ex-writers and Nordics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI work as network development director. Yes, at X, we have about a hundred locations worldwide in 55 countries, 16,000 members. And what we provide coworking space. Our theory of change is to enable, inspire and connect entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs. So we're most focused on that. Then we inspire by bringing in and providing events and relevant and meaningful conversations. We enable people by providing some programs and capacity building around entrepreneurship, and we connect people by hosting them in our spaces and in our global app platform.\u201d\n\n\n## Coworking spaces with support from universities, corporates and governments\n\n\u201cSo we're backed by a monster technology university, X - a fintech firm based in Ireland - and the local council. And we organize events, set up weekends, hackathons, and we're also a space for people to connect. So we try to connect the start-up world with the corporate world so they can give the start-ups some runway and get some exposure for the corporates into what's happening in the start-up world.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tend to not think of it in this context, but actually government agencies are basically large collections of humans working together. In some cases, very large. You take the state of California, the state of California has 860 or 850,000 employees. That's bigger than any IBM or AT&T or the biggest companies you can think of. It's huge. And they're looking for how do they work from home and they have another thing to keep in mind, which is they have to be careful about data. They also have to make sure they keep working. It's not okay to close down government just because people can't get to an office. So they care about disaster resiliency and continuity of operations. So, that's what I'm doing on the side-lines.\u201d\n\n## Change in attitude to remote working \n\n\u201cIf bankers in the city of London are talking about giving up office spaces, that to me is a much more interesting signal to watch for as a society than all the software companies in Silicon Valley saying: \u2018Oh, we're going to just go virtual\u2019.\n\n\u201cTo me, the other things to look at are things like a reduction in real estate valuations. We're seeing commercial real estate valuations drop. And the numbers change of course, day by day and month by month. But the last few months have seen drops between 10 to 20% drop per month, continuing. (That is) from people saying: \"\u2019Why have I got a commercial space if I can't actually get people into the office?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI do actually think that people will want to live in places, like this whole argument of you have to be in the office to have a good job. Well, the last 12 weeks, have proven that to be just not true. So that argument's gone. And then the next thing is people were (saying): \u2018I don't feel safe in an office and I've already proven I can work well from home, so I'm going to work from wherever.\u2019\n\n\u201cI see smaller neighborhood, community coworking spaces, like what X and X do. I think that if every small town of 10,000 people or more had at least one space, I think that's the biggest shift in urban planning and social work that we've had in probably 90 years. I think that's where we're literally in.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n*Are you involved in any interesting coworking projects that you think will help shape the future of the sector or do you have any thoughts on the impacts coworking and remote work will have on our societies and economies?

update (October 22)\n\nLast Tuesday we had the second call with the partners of Trust in Play, I talked about it [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/trust-in-play-october-update/9092/5).\n\nThe main goal of the project is to create an European School of Urban Games design, there will be an open call to find the junior game designer that could participate, then a remote coaching period, an intense week of training and a final weekend festival with new urban games.\n\n\nDuring the meeting we were updated about the meeting that the leader partner had with Creative Europe, we shared our long term vision / extra ideas about the project, few decision about communication, nothing really key so I will use this post to outline the timeline of the project and what is the work of next months.\n\n_note we is used as we-the project partners if it's we-Edgeryders it's specified_\n\nThe first phase of the project (we are in this one right now), is a preparatory phase in which we start knowing each other and then we start working on infrastructure, teams and administrative stuff.\n\nThe second will be the open call phase, in which we look for the potential team of participants of the school.\n\nDuring the third phase all the team will converge and have the training (a week in Athens, October 2019)\n\nAfter that they will finalize the design of new urban games and organize Urban games Festival in their respective countries or there will be a final Festival in Berlin with all the teams invited.\n\n_\nAs I said we are now in the first phase that will end in January with a 5 day meeting in Berlin (between 7 and 15 tbd) when together with all the partners we will outline the final design of the project and agree on definitions and process.\n\nOur (Edgeryders) activities in this first phase is mainly the platform and fund-raising.\n\nPlatform: together with @matthias we are going to develop a [Federated version of Discourse](https://edgeryders.eu/t/creating-whitelabel-platforms-based-on-edgeryders/7419#chap-1), our goal is to collect experience and expertise from european urban game designer, then having the selected teams to share their journey.\n\nI proposed to have the platform ready in the beginning of December, so we can test it and populate it with content that we are going to be used in Berlin.\n\nIn this first phase I imagine mostly that the partners will familiarize with the platform so the interaction with the ER community and the community management activities would be very low.\n\nThe second main activity for the next months is fund-raising.\nThis is a co-financed project so we have to collect our 40%, roughly is 24k.\nThis it's going to be my focus: we had relationship open with Plovdiv and Matera (we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with both of the Committee and check that will be the first thing).\n\nI\u2019m also working to open a collaboration with [the MICA game lab](http://gamelab.mica.edu/), the University where I\u2019m currently working with, to bring a team of US students to participate in the school and the design process, with them covering the cost and give a participation token to the project.\n\n@alberto you said that this could be an activity that bring inside other potential sponsors, do you have someone in mind, or an idea of what could be interesting for them, with the project picture in mind?\n\nI think it could be interesting for other ECoC cities (thinking about Rijeka @noemi ) if small team of designer from those cities will participate they will design something that could enrich their program later.\n\nAlso a smaller invitation could be made to Cultural workers, artistic curator, (operatori culturali) that could participate as visitor/viewer of the Athens training so they can enter the Urban Games community and understand if this kind of solutions are interesting for their cities.\n\nIn term of sponsorship (brand and so on) I don\u2019t know, usually Urban Games have small participation numbers, cheap materials, low technology, so I really don\u2019t know who could be interested.\n\nWhat do you think?

This could potentially be a strong proposal, because:\n\n* You have the start of a theory of how identities can be weaponized to fuel conflict. Your work is smack in the middle of the topic.\n* This theory is, potentially, actionable: it might offer antidotes to identity weaponization. This makes it highly relevant in the context.\n* However, the theory still needs some polish, buttressing etc. Some serious research work might push it over the edge of completeness. This means that the impact of this proposal is potentially high.\n* You have substantial experience in the Balkans.\n* We have a research method, SSNA, that resonates with your theory. There is potential to develop SSNA in the direction to make it do what you want: map the cognitive pathways to identity weaponization.\n* We have some track record in MENA, and part of the 4,500+ Edgeryders community is located there. We also have capacity in the region, with some collaborators who live there, are native speakers of Arabic, etc.\n* Notice the very interesting additional focus on \"foreign fighters\" inside the EU. This calls for a deeper ethnography than we have deployed so far.

It weaves through intentional community, meditation, homesteading, and software development, and arrives at Internet of Humans through three volunteer projects that all come from different angles on this question: how can we use technology to build smarter, more collectively intelligent patterns for systemic change? \n\nThrough a project I started a couple of years ago, currently called the Collective Intelligence Network (http://collectiveintelligence.ca), I'm trying to make sense of the disciplinary silos of research that use the term \"collective intelligence\", find common threads, and identify ways that the best of what we've learned about cooperation can be embedded in technology. \n\nOn a more concrete level, in co-operation with The Open Coop in London, I'm building a protocol and code for organizations to share information about themselves that can be automatically assembled into maps and directories to make movements visible. The aim is to get beyond the multiple, overlapping, incomplete and difficult-to-maintain maps of organizations like co-ops or ecovillages, and create a way for those nodes to very easily host structured data about themselves on their own web sites. Data can be crawled and aggregated, based on filter criteria, so that directories and maps can be built and updated from the authoritative source of the nodes themselves. We're starting with existing data specifications (Schema.org) and the most widely-available web technologies, and plan to launch a prototype next month. \n\nThe third project is in the research stage: could we build a mutual-credit digital currency that would support economic solidarity among next-economy organizations and individuals, outside the tilted playing field of debt-based money? \n\nAll three of these projects are motivated by the sense that the possibility to create a different world -- or play a different game -- exists in the spaces and connections among us. Many of those connections are mediated by technology. Can we build technology that fits the infinite game of regenerative life?\n\nA hurdle that both motivates and hampers these projects is the nature of our economy. In an economic system that rewards the externalization of costs, that is predicated on competition, and that is destroying ecological and human potential, what tools can we use to leverage the benefits of doing things differently into economic viability and abundance? \n\nAnd, personally, what tools can I use to be able to work on things that matter and still eat?\n\nLooking forward to the conversations! \n\nAdam\n\n[CollectiveIntelligence.ca](collectiveintelligence.ca) | [Sapient.life](http://sapient.life) | [Autodidacts.io](http://autodidacts.io) | [Photosynthesis.ca](http://photosynthesis.ca) \nhttps://twitter.com/amckent", "created_at": "2019-05-28 10:58:54.594123", "updated_at": "2019-09-27 08:11:32.703418", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 443, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 254.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4861, 5, 2915, 4, 5158], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53303, "user_id": 4968, "topic_id": 9870, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Of course I will - as always did.

I am posting this in the Name of @RobvanKranenburg. Looking forward to all the creative and thoughtful ideas and comments of yours!\n\n > # Call for use cases ideas for Disposable Identities.\n\n# **The Need:**\n**The goal is to take back the power and control of your own identity and to keep big cooperations  and governments from profiting off of it.** We need a multistakeholder governance on identity with citizens in charge together with SME (small companies) and inclusive tools from democratic organizations. ([disposableidentity.com](http://disposableidentity.com/) and [disposableidentities.eu](http://disposableidentities.eu/) coming soon.)\n\n\n# **Who we are:**\n**We are developing a technical solution for the generation of disposable identities for \"normal users.\"** \n\n# **The Opportunity:**\n**We will reach out to the best use case idea's and use our resources and technical know-how to develop your idea into a serious pitch or call application.**\nYou own your use cases and ideas are theirs. We offer to help in making it into a pitch for a pitch, portfolio, investors or making it ready to apply for an [NGI.eu](http://ngi.eu/) call. The next step to realising your DID idea!\n\n# **The Call:**\n*We ask you for the use cases you can imagine for such DiD's.*\nSend your idea to Rob van Kranenburg at rob at [dyne.org](http://dyne.org/)\n\n\n# **About DID's:**\n\nThe idea is that from a DiD a person can generate a disposable (limited in time, in purpose and scope) identity for each separate service (for example one for rent, one for the energy company, one for the water company) that can only be seen, controlled and traced back by the DID owner and that one specific service. So no one can aggregate services, nor are you ever fully exposed as a person unless you decide to, because you just send token/credential \u2018enough money in the bank\u2019 to rent, water and energy company as they just need to know that you can pay, not who you are.\n\nCoding context: [zenroom.org](http://zenroom.org/)\n\n\n# How it works\n\n[Zenroom.org](http://zenroom.org/) allows you to get credentials from a CA, like for example \u201cI\u2019m above 18\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Belgian\u201d and \u201ctoday I have more than 1000 EUR in my bank\u201d. Each credential is a crypto object, signed by the CA.\n\nEach time you want to use any of these credentials, they get anonymized, so if you use them twice, they don\u2019t look the same and can not be linked to each other and therefore not traced back to you.\n\n# Example Use Case:\nSo for example, if you need to access a service that requires you to be 18+ and Belgian, you\u2019d use those 2 anonymized credentials\u2026 the next day you use a different service that requires you to be 18+ and has 1000K EUR in your bank account, so you use those 2 other anonymized credentials: both times  **you effectively generated and used a disposable identity**, because only the CA could know who you are, but the services can only see that the CA signed the fact that you are Belgian, 18+ etc.\n\n# \n\n**Send your idea to Rob van.

W mojej ocenie (kobiety 30+) rodzinnie naznaczonej t\u0105 chorob\u0105 \u2013 w ostatnim dziesi\u0119cioleciu wiele organizacji zar\u00f3wno spo\u0142ecznych, jako i rz\u0105dowych pracowa\u0142o nad tym, by temat ten by\u0142 obecny w przestrzeni publicznej, a wiedza o profilaktyce dociera\u0142a do jak najwi\u0119kszej liczby polskich kobiet. Czy nasza wiedza o zagro\u017ceniu si\u0119 zwi\u0119kszy\u0142a? \u2013 z pewno\u015bci\u0105.

Zobaczy\u0142am plakat, pomy\u015bla\u0142am \u2013 to mnie mo\u017ce dotyczy\u0107, chc\u0119 skorzysta\u0107. Telefon pod numer wskazany na plakacie \u2013 zaj\u0119te przez ca\u0142y dzie\u0144, wi\u0119c nast\u0119pnego dnia wyskoczy\u0142am z pracy i uda\u0142am si\u0119 osobi\u015bcie. Naiwnie my\u015bla\u0142am, \u017ce skoro udaj\u0119 si\u0119 do przychodni to od razu nast\u0105pi kwalifikacja i badanie. Nie, na miejscu uda\u0142o si\u0119 um\u00f3wi\u0107 na wizyt\u0119 lekarsk\u0105. W dniu wizyta kolejne urwanie z pracy. Udzieli\u0142am lekarzowi odpowiedzi na kilka pyta\u0144, kt\u00f3re r\u00f3wnie dobrze mog\u0142am przedstawi\u0107 przy zapisie pani piel\u0119gniarce. Zakwalifikowa\u0142am si\u0119 jako docelowy odbiorca akcji i \u2026.. dosta\u0142am kolejny termin spotkania, tym razem ju\u017c na badanie. Urlop z pracy, wyczekane badanie i koniec. Uda\u0142o si\u0119, mam potwierdzenie, \u017ce jest ok &#128522; Co powiedzia\u0142am Kole\u017cankom o akcji \u2013 fajna, ale wkurzy\u0142am si\u0119, \u017ce wymaga\u0142a a\u017c trzykrotnego stawiania si\u0119 w przychodni i to w godzinach pracy.\n\nKolejnych pr\u00f3b darmowego zbadania piersi nie podejmowa\u0142am. W tym roku postanowi\u0142am wbrew wszelkim opiniom Kole\u017canek, kt\u00f3re ginekologa odwiedzaj\u0105 tylko prywatnie (\u201ebo nie ma problemu z terminem wizyty, wykonaniem bada\u0144, bo sprz\u0119t jest nowy\u201d etc.) skorzysta\u0107 ponownie z akcji spo\u0142ecznej zach\u0119caj\u0105cej do bada\u0144. Wizyta u lekarza w ramach NFZ \u2013 na pytanie o skierowanie na badanie piersi wr\u0119czy\u0142 mi formularz kwalifikacji do akcji i kaza\u0142 um\u00f3wi\u0107 si\u0119 na nast\u0119pn\u0105 wizyt\u0119 za miesi\u0105c (i przyj\u015b\u0107 z wype\u0142nionym formularzem). Teraz nie da, bo \u201ena ten miesi\u0105c ma ju\u017c du\u017co, zabij\u0105 go za wypisywanie tylu skierowa\u0144\u201d. Na pytanie czy w\u00f3wczas za miesi\u0105c badanie wykona \u2013 nie, ale wype\u0142ni wtedy skierowanie na kolejn\u0105 wizyt\u0119 do w\u0142a\u015bciwej osoby. Pasuj\u0119. Umawiam si\u0119 na wizyt\u0119 u kolejnego lekarza. M\u00f3wi\u0119 mu, \u017ce nie bada\u0142am piersi od 5 lat, a w rodzinie by\u0142 przypadek nowotworu. Nie reaguje wpatrzony w komputer. Po zwyk\u0142ym badaniu \u017cegna si\u0119. Pytam o skierowanie na USG piersi \u2013 ok, da. Umawiam si\u0119 na USG i odwiedzam przychodni\u0119 w kolejnym terminie. Pod drzwiami s\u0142ucham kolejnych historii wychodz\u0105cych z gabinetu kobiet: \u201ejak si\u0119 nie zap\u0142aci to nic dobrze nie zrobi\u0105\u201d, \u201enie przy\u0142o\u017cy\u0142 si\u0119, na akord g\u0142owic\u0105 je\u017adzi\u201d, \u201epodyktowa\u0142 piel\u0119gniarce b\u0142\u0119dne dane, mam dwa lewe cycki\u201d, \u201emia\u0142 napisane, \u017ce ma zrobi\u0107 USG piersi, a czytam na wyniku, \u017ce zrobi\u0142 samych sutk\u00f3w\u201d itd. Dzwoni\u0119 do Siostry zapyta\u0107 jak u niej. W swojej przychodni dosta\u0142a skierowanie, ale na USG dost\u0119pny termin ma za\u2026. 8 miesi\u0119cy. Dlaczego tyle, skoro ja czeka\u0142am tylko tydzie\u0144? Bo skierowanie od jednej przychodni nie honoruj\u0105 w innej, cho\u0107 maj\u0105 wcze\u015bniejsze terminy na USG. Wieczorem odpalam facebooka i widz\u0119 reklam\u0119 R\u00f3\u017cowej Wst\u0105\u017cki \u2013 no tak, pa\u017adziernik!

Na funpage\u2019u rozczarowane komentarze od kobiet: co to za akcja, wi\u0119cej czasu i pieni\u0119dzy posz\u0142o na promocj\u0119 akcji ni\u017c na realizacj\u0119 faktycznych bada\u0144.

Ale bezp\u0142atne badanie to fikcja dost\u0119pna nielicznym lub tylko dla tych cierpliwych.

Members build meaningful research partnerships and pursue funding together.\n\nWe are not-for-profit community-driven research institute organised as a network. We are incorporated as an Estonian private limited company; maintain offices in Brussels and Stockholm; and operate globally. We use unique community-building tools and research techniques to detect and enhance citizen innovation, in response to key societal, economic, ecological and political challenges.\n\nWe aspire to bring the citizenry\u2019s collective intelligence to contribute to a more grounded public policy. Over the years, we have engaged and connected many individuals in an online forum with about 6,000 registered user and 70,000 posts. Besides their scientific output, our research projects tend to bring about real-world impact, as they inspire initiatives by the respective communities. We are especially interested in regional economic development, citizen engagement, participatory culture, citizen science, transitions to a low-carbon economy, social innovation and societal resilience.\n\nAs a partner in European research projects, Edgeryders is responsible for designing and running massive online conversation on the specific topic of interest for the project, by activating and on-boarding members of civic and political constituencies with firsthand experience across the domain landscape. The conversation is then analysed through [Social Semantic Network Analysis](https://zenodo.org/record/1059029#.Xrlb5mgzaUn) to enable the consortium to navigate a collective mental map, and filter it to produce high-level \"big pictures\". This is done by using graph theory and software to build a network of ethnographic codes that represent the conversation which can be considered as a collective mental map of the problem at hand. It comes with a filtering technique that allows human researchers to make sense of even very large graphs, with thousands of contributions and ethnographic codes.\n\nWe couple community engagement and community management methodologies to ensure an interface between online and offline participation, and between individuals who are digitally at ease and those farther off the Internet map. We collaborate closely with pre-existing networks in order to start from active communities on the ground. And use the social network model to reach further citizens in the locations  of interest for the project. \n\nWe complement online discussions with physical onboarding workshops throughout the whole project making sure to disseminate at large deeper insights and findings. We train community managers to ensure quality and respectful dialogue. We deploy and expand our open research tools to harvest the content of the discussions, including leading ethnographic coding and managing a coding ontology. \n\n## Semantic Social Networks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLSqjwjia18\n\n* Convene  **large-scale online conversations** , with hundreds of participants and thousands of contributions.\n* Perform  **ethnographic coding**  directly in-platform, and transform the conversation into structured data.\n* Instantly  **visualize the associations**  across ethno codes, and the interaction across participants.\n* Use the  **power of graphs**  to make inference about how the conversation\u2019s \u201ccollective brain\u201d perceives the issue under discussion.\n* **Integrated workflow**  supported by open source software.\n* **GDPR compliance**  and personal data minimization.\n* **Consent funnel**  for ethically acquiring informed consent to participating in research.\n* Our 2020  **[journal paper](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1525822X20908236)** .\n\n\n### Ongoing projects\n* **NGI Forward**  (January 2019 \u2013 December 2021)\nWhat should the Internet - and all it encompasses, which means pretty much everything - really do for humanity?

We're behind the browser Firefox. And for the last few years, we've been working on internet health.\n\nPeter  0:11  \nThank you. Thanks so much for making the time. So we want to have this conversation as part of Edgeryders Internet of Humans project. And I just wanted to explore a little bit with you, in your words, how you tackle these value driven digital projects? What is it you actually work on? What are the challenges, but maybe that started with how did you get involved involved with this and what you're excited about these days?\n\nMichelle   \nI got first gotten interested in all things internet about 15 years ago.\n\n  \nAnd I was actually a very passionate early Wikipedia when the project was just getting started. And I remember telling everybody I knew like my university professors, \"there's this amazing website that lets you edit all these these different articles. And it's all the world's knowledge and all the world's languages.\" And I just thought that was the most ambitious and coolest thing on the internet. And so that was kind of my window into free culture and open source. After going to the first week of <mania?> in Frankfurt, Germany, I learned about Creative Commons, where I later worked. And after being at Creative Commons for a few years, started to work at the Mozilla Foundation. So the idea of, you know, open, participatory, global, ambitious digital projects has always been the big job for me.\n\nPeter  1:44  \nOkay, so participation, I think that's a really important part. How do we put users or people like you into that scenario first? And how do we empower them? And how does that play a role in your your more recent work?  \n\nMichelle  2:05  \nI'm really interested in the internet, and the role it plays in society. I see it as a global public resource, and something really worthy of attention and care. I think one of the challenges we see today is that participation is more complicated than it was, let's say, in the earlier days of the internet, we've seen the rise of these big centralized platforms, which use their corporate policies to control how you participate. There is very little governance from the user side, and how those platforms might change or respond to people's needs. And we're also seeing the rise of behaviors online, hate speech and other kinds of violence aggravating actions that have kind of put people into retreat, or help to polarize people. So we have other social media platforms who really benefit from benefit from outrage and benefit from content that gets, quote, engagement. But it's actually creating a kind of polarized atmosphere online, and people are retreating and participating less, or just participating in their smaller groups and just talking about the average. So it's become a kind of, at least in my experience, and what I've heard anecdotally and seen in some studies, just the internet as a place of participation is a lot more money, the Muslim foundation on on the team that I'm on, we support all sorts of leaders in the internet health movement, who are tackling these different kinds of issues. So there's a whole group of people, Camille included, who are talking about misinformation, and how do you combat the rise of misinformation online? People talking about how do we talk about hate speech and radicalized speech online. And we also run a bunch of campaigns around these topics that I've been working on the last few years is the Internet of Things, and how to make it more responsible, more open, more private, and also include these ideas of participation and co-creation, because the Internet of Things has typically been a lot of black box appliances, without a lot of in a real agency to change them.\n\nPeter  4:17  \nYou just touched on something that I personally find really interesting, because as you know, I also work a lot around IoT. And Internet of Things is one of these awkward fields that doesn't have really clear bounds. But you touched on one of the inherent issues there, like you met just mentioned, openness and privacy, and as a term, how do you resolve that? Or how do you think about this tension?\n\nMichelle  4:40  \nThe IoT projects, I think, get it right or on the right path are ones that are open in their designs and their code and in their explanation of their business model and around like, how how the thing works, and also how did this thing comes to be in terms of supply chain, and in terms of the materials and things that go into it, as well as the third parties that work with it. So there's a whole, for me, openness is starting to become a much broader, you know, includes many things are, you know, transparency and how that device is made. What that device interacts with, in addition to the licensing of a name, it's like codes. And I think that those practices help to build trust. Because when you can see that an audit that information you can better understand is this a service or product that I'm willing to trust. And I think part of what that openness is about is around disclosing what happens with your data, what partners that company is in contact with or, partnering with, what their IT security update policies are, these are all things that help you make an informed decision whether you will trust this device with your data, and therefore, consider it a privacy worth preserving.\n\nPeter  6:03  \nYou talk about privacy and data protection and the right to your own privacy. I've recently read a few really interesting points that I have to admit I hadn't quite realized that they had to put it so eloquently around individuals, the role of individuals versus collective rights. So we have a corporations that <to bear thing?>. We have lawmakers to kind of provide a framework for that. But a lot of the rhetoric, especially on Silicon Valley, and even a lot of the activist groups is the individual needs protect their own right? What do you think about that?\n\nMichelle  6:44  \nI think in general, we put too much pressure on the individual to have to protect themselves and all sorts of areas of our lives, technology, internet, it's just one of them. I do think there are responsibilities of governments and corporations. And I think we're seeing the rise of, thanks to digital tools, some sort of collective agency and collective bargaining. So pools of users able to put together their demands, their needs, their permissions, and through more collective bargaining, able to negotiate. And so I think that for me, that's a kind of a new area worthy of more exploration and others that some people may be sitting in this network are looking at things like digital cooperatives. And I think that that's going to be a really interesting place. Because Yeah, I think, only putting the burden on the individual to have to understand all these different policies, all the different permissions, all the different technical capabilities. And do this in like the seconds of free time they have between their otherwise strapped lives is unfair, and not a society I want to advocate for.\n\nPeter  7:50  \nI couldn't agree more. And also, it's like, as an individual, even if miraculously. And this should not be a crime in Canada, possible zero crime, but even if you will be able to read and fully understand and fully navigate all the privacy policies in the world, a lot of the magic of data exploitation still happens once the data is your individual data is collected with like data of like 150,000, or like 100 or 2 million other people. And none of the privacy policies even tagged with that level at all. That's like the Wild West. Completely. Interesting. \n\nSo you started from the free culture was your gateway drug and open source that led you to Creative Commons, where you helped open up licenses and copyright, to give creators more power, rather than the copyright regime? That led you to do the foundation? And where you've been digging into into internet health? And user empowerment? What are some of the tools in the toolkit? What were some of the tools you've been using? I know, there's a PhD program. That's just kicking off. There was a thing called the almighty studio, which was like an internal program. Can you just give a brief overview of like, your personal journey there?\n\nMichelle 9:14  \nI started the Mozilla Foundation, when Mark Simon, the executive director, had also just recently joined. And he had the ambition to take the Mozilla Foundation, which was pretty strongly just focused on Firefox, the browser, and maybe a little bit the web as a platform, and said, like, we need to be fueling a movement for the help of the internet. And so his application blog post is called A Million Brazilians. And at the time, that was a quite radical and ambitious proposal to the organization. And so I've been working with him for over a decade, and the things that I have done and have helped to make that vision a reality. Little bit, these projects started off with what's called the Mozilla Festival. And the idea was, let's bring together these different, primarily open players in the open space. So we had people from open hardware, open science, open education. And we had Wikipedia there, you know, we had a collection of project open video, there was a smattering of these open efforts around the world. And we thought let's bring them together. And here's a look at also learn from all these different movements that we're applying openness to other fields. So that's where you build your rainbow coalition, so to speak. Okay. And that helps give\nus specific projects and people that we could be investing in and supporting over the years. And what's interesting is even over a decade that's had for various permutations, but a lot of the key ideas still continue. So I still think I still use convenience as this really important way to bring together a coalition, a network of people who might otherwise not work together, to really create, like, a new community of practice out of these diverse groups. And by working on specific and achievable projects, you are able to actually give people like a collaborative substrate that lets something move forward. So I think that those some of those templates that still continue. And I have definitely learned over the years, but I think those are are quite powerful tools, especially in the nonprofit space.\n\nPeter  11:26  \nSo that's communities of practice.  Individually walk us through the learning curve of the Open IT Studio and how that led to open dot and set the stage for the next chapters.\n\nMichelle 11:41  \nOne theme that kind of emerged through that work of the years, which also include included web literacy, and being part of the kind of learn to code movement was this idea of before the first falling at the Physical Web. \n\nDepending on circle you're in, you would sometimes say different words to what we set out on IoT, because that started just to be the term that was getting more traction. But anyways, I partnered with a professor from the University of Dundee, Jon Rogers, who I had worked with for many years through the Mozilla festival, we just really got along and just said, like, hey, every time we talk, there's all sorts of ideas and things that we can be working on. So let's just Skype with each other once a week, and see where it goes. And so for a few months, you know, he came from a design research background, really interested in the physical aspects of the web and of interaction as an electrical engineer. I was coming from this digital rights, free culture, participatory open perspective. And so we would just mash together ideas. And then it emerged, we could actually make some sort of program that could be hosted with Mozilla and the University of DD, that tried to take those different values and approaches and apply to Internet of Things. Say we started the Open IT Studio in 2016, with the idea of, let's support a community of practice of designers, technologists, philosophers, historians, digital rights advocates, to talk about what can we do to make it a healthier space for humans. And I think that project was quite successful, definitely a highlight of my career, there were a few things that came out of it that might be interesting for people to check out. One I can recommend is the Anatomy of AI, which is a collaboration between <blood and jeweler from Sherry labs, and Kate Crawford from AI now?>\n\n \nAnd they took an Amazon Alexa. And they said, let's do a truly exploded view. So in design, you have this thing called exploded me, which usually just shows you the physical parts that go into device. But we said with connected devices, the story is much bigger than just the small material parts that go into it. So <what I'm?> created the most amazing map, it's four meters by four meters, which was exhibited at the V and A Museum in London and has toured around Europe and beyond. And it's shows you the lifecycle of an Amazon Alexa from the mining and the smelting and the production of the components to then when it's actually running all of the data centers and content moderation advertising to the end of life, recycling, and others and otherwise discarding of the device and what is the true cost of Amazon Alexa; what really goes into it. And I think that for me, that project, The Anatomy of AI, is such a great touchstone for when we think about IoT. Often we talk about IoT, we just see a smart light bulb, or we often just see an object, you know, some sort of traffic light or something. But it's really the new vast network of stuff before, during and after that device where things get really interesting. So I think that that for me was just such a great example of bringing that to life.\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:14  \nThe victory really, really important point to highlight there, I think we're like to really think about the analyzer the hidden costs. Because Yeah, if you see this device, it's like, yeah, okay, here's a device it costs x. But of course, that's  a fraction of of the story. Really. It's just the last three minutes of a long, long saga.  I mean, I guess it's true for most products, but a connected product with chips built in. And also like a IM and cloud infrastructure, it's a very tied into these larger hidden infrastructures.\n\nMichelle  15:52  \nAnd I think it's not even just the last minutes, it's actually the beginning of a whole new day, a whole new 24 hours, because so for example, Amazon Alexa, it's sold incredibly cheaply. I mean, compact, like it's very inexpensive device. But some of the main things it's doing is it's becoming a much more direct portal for people to order things from Amazon. But probably more importantly, it's become a whole voice snippet, like gathering system, which is powering Amazon's Alexa, that is probably the true value of having your Alexa in everyone's home. For me it like that with working with Open IT Studio and with Jon, and with our collaborators or whichever one Peter, this kind of growing conversation amongst technologists, different professionals in the tech sector around how do we make the internet especially these newer emerging technologies within associated with Internet? How do we make them more understandable? How do we make decisions that lead to these products being more responsible, or the people making them be more responsible? So I think some of it is about transparency and understanding. So things like this map. And some of it are tools, like one project that we worked on together the TrustMark, the trust mark for IoT, which is something that you can then use as a tool for vetting whether your product needs a certain standard and hoping to be giving users some agency and figuring out like, is this something that I really want to have in my home or my life?\n\nPeter 17:25  \nSo would you say, if anyone who would be the main audience for for these, these products you're mentioning, because you mentioned on the one hand, you really want to empower users and give them the tools to make better decisions. On the other hand, we discussed this tension, how individuals can only do so much when they are faced with giant global infrastructures and systems. Did you have like a specific audience in mind? And you're thinking: does it depend on a project? How do you think about these things?\n\nMichelle  18:00  \nI think the place where we have the most effect, maybe some better leverage, is working with other professionals and practitioners. Because those are, that's an audience. That's kind of a more notable in size and scale, or size, and just and profile. And those are people who are making daily decisions in their lives that go into those products. So those were our key audiences. So working with Jon: he's teaching next generation product designers. So we had a whole thing around education, from undergraduate to graduate. And now we have a PhD program funded by the U looking at responsible IoT, I think this idea of what are we doing in the higher education space to train people going into the field that will have these kinds of considerations, as well as people who are in the field who are making kind of daily decisions, and then also all sorts of kind of user advocates. So we work with Consumer Reports, we work with nonprofits, we work in the digital rights space, all these people were kind of advocating on behalf of users. And they love these kinds of examples and tools, because it helps them give point to something maybe a little more tangible or intuitive than just a policy briefing.\n\nPeter  19:19  \nPolicy. I wonder if what you're describing shows that there's there might be a generation of product designers coming up that understand these issues much, much better. And now I wonder if the same is happening in the political science schools and the law schools? What is the status there? <Or if you're lagging behind if they've already like TechStars completely differently. And underwear?>\n\nMichelle  19:45  \nIt's a great question. I was recently reflecting with a friend of mine that when in college, I studied critical social thought. And we did a lot of thinking and writing, but very little making. And if I could recreate my degree I would have critical social and critical making as my double major. Because I think you're right, I think actually the, let's say the makers, I think we're seeing this in the computer science departments and the design departments, engineering departments of all kinds are getting a lot more ethics curriculum and support to think about the ethical components of their work. I think that's on the rise. It's on the rise, but I think some of the other humanities actually don't do enough making of their own. So I'm sure when you're studying law, you would very, very few project would actually encourage you to do anything like make a trust, like a prototype, just mark that actually tries to put some of your law practice into something more tangible. And I I'm a firm believer that we learn through making and even though I'm not a skilled maker, I think that this is a an amazing process to try to turn ideas into something tangible, something that's testable, something that lives in another mode.\n\nPeter  21:01  \nWhat are the kinds of reactions you get when you start talking to other people about these super complex technical issues because things kind of work in our nonprofit like, that's, that's something that I sometimes find a bit of a struggle when you're so steeped in that thinking, and then you are someone who you've learned from, but I can also learn from from the work you've been doing there. But they have not been sitting there thinking the same way, because they do their own thing. And then all of a sudden, you're like, Oh, well, how do I first of all wrap my head around all the stuff you've been doing to see how this applies? But also, how can I distill this? And not scare anyone away and have them put their head in the sand?  Because there's such a big brain dump. And the issues are so overwhelmingly big, it's like a weird scale and fuzzy around the edges. Does that make sense?  \n\nMichelle 22:00  \nWe exhibited at the V and A during digital design weekend, and you get, like 25,000 people come through, and check out our work. And you have to talk to all sorts of people from all walks of life. And so yes, a lot of it's contextual, but who you're in front of. But I find in general, many people have a smartphone, most smartphones have some sort of voice assistant running on them. I think a smartphone is one of people's first IoT devices in this way. And so actually talking to people about their phone, how do they use their phone and the user voice assistant? What do they think about that? Do they know where that data is going? What do they think about those companies have it, it's all those funny stories around? Accent accents being misunderstood, like the Scottish person trying to talk to Siri, in these people really relate to those stories, and have their own experiences with them. And that becomes kind of a channel through which you can talk about some of these other internet health issues.\n\nPeter  23:02  \nThat's right. That's especially true for, say, a general audience. But you mentioned that you mostly target in your practice, practitioners. Are they open for these kind of arguments? Or is this a thing that a shrug off as a Yeah, yeah, security, privacy. \n\nMichelle  23:25  \nI'm seeing increasingly people who don't want their work to be adding to the shadiness in the world. <What but not everyone?> just released a really great study around tech workers and their attitudes, was focused on the UK, but they showed that I think one in five tech workers, is ready to leave a job if the employers makes an error, like an unethical decision, which cost the company like 30,000 times. So I think this is anecdotally and then also in the sector, more people want to have ethical decisions in what they build. And so I'm actually finding more people, who you don't have to convince them that these are things to work on. It's more that was more how oftentimes, you'll find that people are people who work in the tech sector are coming up against the business of the company is the thing that is at odds, it may be not their product manager or their design team, everyone's on board. But you have you coming down to some bigger question around like, how is that company financed? And so I think some of the big innovations of the coming decade will actually be around reforming our economic models.\n\nPeter  24:38  \nSo I think we had, like I said, as a really solid basis for you know, like, if like, have companies like a fantastic group, doing a lot of like research, you've like increased transparency, and started building tools and mechanisms to empower people. And I think we're like breaking, kind of like new ground, like in a fairly literal literal like knowledge, workI kind of sense. And that you're now involved in where you you co founded a PhD program. And PhD programs are, of course about like, contributing absolutely new research and knowledge and really expanding the field in a way that hadn't been before. Right. So can you talk a little bit about this? And we'll also hear more about this from john Rogers, two partners, but like, how do you get involved with this? How does this come together? And where do you see this going? \n\nMichelle 25:27  \nI think of how this project came to life. And thanks to the maintenance of the European Commission to prioritize these kinds of training networks, which seems to be a unique thing in the world that they say we need to get universities and in the industry together to think and to move forward to these new kinds of trainings. And especially they were interested in things like a nonprofit like Mozilla, who really focus on these more societal implications of technology. So I think that's a really amazing that they even have this kind of like structure. So it's going to be a three year PhD program that actually the there's five PhD students who are at this moment moving to Dundee, Scotland to start next week. And they come, they come from all over the world. And the idea is that they're going to be researching, through design practices, their philosophical practices through coding practices, and legal practices, ways to advance a healthier Internet of Things. So what that will look like in practice is like, very much going to be determined on what they bring to it. But we focused on different layers of where we see it playing out from the body, to the home to the neighborhood, in the city. And then we also did a cross cutting project or on the checkmark, and helps to try to bring those ideas together. So I'm quite excited to see what it's like, I think, to have a PG program paired with a nonprofit is exciting, they're going to also come to facility Berlin, for a year and a half to be more embedded in our office here. And then they're being advised by an array of really amazing organizations who are at the forefront of this responsible space, moving things on, simply secure.  I want to take this program, as much as I want to run it.\n\nPeter  27:25  \nI think it's really neat that you're able to get the kind of supervisor support from people who are doing this kind of tech advocacy, also.\n \nSo that kind of opens up the space beyond like pure IoT into activism into academia, but also, one of the themes that that I've seen throughout this is thinking about Commons, versus just exploitation, about sustainability, in terms of  short term gains. And I think recently, you've talked more openly and more and more today, about a greener web and more sustainability in terms of the digital services and the web infrastructure we use. Where was your thinking of this?\n\nMichelle 28:12  \nThe stat that really set me back was learning that the internet contributes 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, which basically puts it on par with the airline industry. I think for a long time, we've lived in some sort of digital denial that the internet is physical, in that sense, in the sense that it requires environmental resources and adds to pollution. But as in the tech sector, we've never shied away from imagining different futures and innovating. So it's actually a place where I think the internet both is a heavy contributor to emissions, as well as it can be an amazing tool to reduce its own as well as used to mobilize and organize for climate action.\n \nRecently, I've been really interested in the idea of becoming carbon neutral Internet, and what it would take to reduce those emissions. The great news is that there are many wonderful humans of the internet who are interested in this in this problem as well. And there's already like an array of actions that are happening from moving data centers to renewables, to designing websites and web services that have a lower footprint, to extending the life of connected devices, there's a whole bunch of things people are doing that in aggregate can actually reduce emissions. And so for me, that's really exciting, not just thinking about it in the internet sector, but also just seeing the mobilization around a climate agenda. We see that really strongly here in Germany with Friday's for future, and the recent European elections, this I think, strong mandate from the public to do something about it. And I've really taken that kind of momentum to heart. \n\nWithin Mozilla, we started a small group of people who are pushing for more climate activism within the organization, which you can expect to hear more from soon. And just being more involved and also learning. There's a lot to learn about, about the climate crisis. But I think it's something that now when I think about  what does it mean to be responsible technologists, I think previously, I really saw it as being around openness and privacy, inclusion, and all these topics. But now I'm increasingly seeing it has to also include the climate and kind of moving up or probably down the stack really deeper into the base layers. I keep putting like penthouses on it, but actually basement that needed investigation. People that I've spoken to have felt this kind of dissonance between amazing internet future that, for example, that me and all these open movement people have been advocating for, and the hard reality of the climate crisis, but I think there's a way to actually address that dissonance head on and not be paralyzed in action, but actually to do something about it. That's, that's where I'm at at the moment.\n\nPeter  31:12  \nThat's really interesting that you've hinted at this, but it's, I think, a really, really important reminder that oftentimes, if you want to put people first, it means that you need to work throughout all the conditions so that people just come first. So in this case you need data and design practices to put people in the center, you need to make sure that there's a planetary perspective in order to, for the people to have a chance to be front and center. So that's really interesting to see how there's this big red thread that connects them all. And the thing is, it's very illustrative of, of the tech industry in the tech scene over the last 10 years, from kind of utopian activists, as soon as we can, like, digitize and everything will be better, automatically to have, okay, there's actually there's complications once it hits a certain scale, and more people come in and all that stuff, and the dynamics change, and now we need to remedy some of the potential problems, too. Oh, now we really need to dig in and, and see if we are contributing to a problem because it's such a dominant force of power. \n\nNow. I think we could wrap up, is there anything I should have asked anything you'd like to add any anything, any shout outs you want to give?\n\nMichelle  32:36  \nI mean, just think about this project being in the context of the European Union. In much of my work over the years, I've really seen the European Union be this kind of beacon of hope, from be it from a regulatory perspective, be it from an agenda setting perspective be addressed from like a celebration of multiculturalism will do lingual ism. And now, also putting the climate high on the high on the priority list. Even as a non US citizen, I really believe in the project of the EU. And  I think it's one of the most modern and exciting things that is happening on the planet, I think for the EU to really be invested in a thought leader around what the internet could be and helping to create this kind of alternative vision for it that are dominated by the prevailing centralized service capitalism models. I think, you know, that hasn't made me more public, public good perspective. I think there's something I really am hopeful for and to help lead. So that's exciting. And one of the reasons I was excited to participate in this project.\n\nPeter  33:45  \nAwesome.

In this sense I was actually more referring to dialogue than collaboration. I think concerns about data is getting more and more mainstream, leading to some degree of self censorship, though I would argue hate speech is the main issue we face. \nAnyway these concerns are also alive on the fringes in decentralized networks, for instance, a small example regarding scuttlebutt:\n\n\"Another problematic issue is that you cannot delete posts. Once your posts appear on others' computers, they no longer have a singular home where they can be accessed & destroyed. Once you send out those posts, they now have multiple homes. I understand that the protocol's very structure makes deletion difficult. I do. Many developers argue that SSB is the place for  \"sober\" commentary, that the permanence gives folks pause for posting. I don't know: we've collectively witnessed at least 4 decades of online bad behavior. Also, folks say stupid shit all the time. Should they be held accountable forever? What if they wish to leave Scuttlebutt? What if they're being targeted by malicious actors? What if they just wish to reduce their digital shadows? **If you can't delete your posts, do you really own your data?**\" Source: https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://sdf.org:70/0/users/rusty/Post04-ssb\n\n@alcinnz\n\nI think there worldbrain is really on point, as I think information overload is a real issue, as well as quality information. \n\n\nAnother thought that I had last days is the curiosity of gender in community building and construction of networks. If one looks to society, this is generally something where females take the lead, keeping connections in support networks, arranging and managing the social sphere. Would a collaboration, community build by non-cis-male engineers look differently?

We discussed this in a different thread on ER. \n\nEmphasis on value of interaction as part of ethnographic approach \n\nNeed to read: Phil Howard's 2002 article in New Media and Society on Network Ethnography and the Hypermedia Organization (amusingly, he is my supervisor's husband and is also at the OII); also read Hine 2000. \n\n'Reflexive Intersubjectivity' -- crucial to good ethnography. Useful phrase to capture how we engage online (e.g. we do not lurk!)\n\nHine --- \"dialogue between clearly interpelated individuals, and an ethnographer who attempts to make herself and her goals as clear as possible\" (150)\nHeath et al 1999 interact with users \n\t- \"knowledge comes from engagement and interaction, always both purposive and incidental\" (150) \n\nBlog -- using blog as introduction to explain research and to let informants follow the development of the thesis (Mortensen and Walker 2002, 51) \n\t- Just like our open research group on ER\n\nTo gamers, easier to fake an actual-world persona than it is to maintain a consistent long term online presence (ibid) \n\nBlog and phenomena studied \"live\" in the same space (just like Edgeryders) \n\t- Form of communication and use of technology are aligned to the cultural phenomena being investigated \n\t\t\u25cb Challenges practice of leaving field for writing up\n\t\t\u25cb Ethnography develops a 'more ongoing' character \n\nApparently, blogging has been a source of backlash by peers, considered too 'journalistic' (Glenn 2003) \n\nChanging values in wake of new scientific communication \n\nThe Internet: An Ethnographic Approach by Miller and Slater (2000) \n\nArrival stories in ethnographies of the internet -- Baym 1995; Correll 1995\n\nCapture--- internet allows for recovering mediated interactions as text\n\t- Open and accessible (these are tropes)\n\nText is the only thing to be analyzed (also trope) --- important for us to explain onboarding processes and our offline events, and the liveliness/live action elements of conversation. Beyond world-as-text (though no ethnographer actually sees online interaction as an example of true culture-as-text).\n\nDigital allows for the scaling up ethnography, making it a sustainable and cost-effective way of observing everyday life for industry as part of R&D (she sees this as a hype/problematic kind of move, since it's complicated, and also in the service of questionable aims) -- Marsten and Plowman 2003 \n\n\"The anxiety about a possible loss of the epistemic gain of the translating/trascribing ethnographer, through a realisation that textuality is always already present, may also be compensated by the creation of yet more complex transcriptions, such as network diagrams, large-scale semi-automated content analysis\u2026this may lead to interesting new conversations between ethnography and other methodological approaches\" (159)", "created_at": "2018-09-21 11:27:57.193793", "updated_at": "2018-09-21 11:29:36.762017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 13.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [47491], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47046, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8990, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The wise Giulio Quaggiotto discovered this: \n\nhttps://www.epicpeople.org/data-and-experience/\n\nIt is potentially important to us, as it advocates for ethnography as a way to make sense of the connection between aggregated data (rise of average temperatures across time and space) and evidence (heat waves, wildfires, climate refugees etc.). This is not a straightforward elimination of statistical noise, because climate change is lived out in ways that depend on non-climate variables: for example, this summer's forest fires in Greece were perceived through the lens of austerity politics, that have prompted the embattled Greek government to cut on the costs of firefighting services. \n\nI can see a clear application to make use of collective intelligence to build these links. In the example in question, an ethnography of Greeks affected by forest fires would reveal how the and why the event is seen as an austerity event, as opposed to a climate change event, break down the exact ways how the links between the two phenomena play out, and suggest policy and community responses.\n\n@amelia, what do you think?", "created_at": "2018-09-03 05:00:38.457670", "updated_at": "2018-09-03 05:05:50.958165", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 182, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 122.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64043, "user_id": 5520, "topic_id": 10794, "post_number": 30, "raw": "[Human Labour, the new economic unit of account for Value (page 1-12, version 11-11-2019).pdf|attachment](upload://bfV9EnXO829T6sZTgtVMMnrrOcK.pdf) (169.4 KB) \n\nHello Ilaria,\n\nThank you for your message.

My research (e.g. Building Brave New Worlds: Science Fiction and Transition Design) is entrenched in how science fiction can inform the design of complex systems in the future. My most recent keynote was for Business Finland and the Office of the Finnish Prime Minister on Utopias. \n\n\nMy creative practice includes making story-based speculative designs and experiential futures to help organizations and the public better understand complex emerging issues. My most notable work is \"The Only Three Trends That Matter' which featured Job Ads from the Future, and introduced a systems-based minimum specification for future-proofing. This piece has influenced organizations such as research institutes to adjust their approach to the future of work. As a practitioner, I integrate my worldbuilding and storytelling techniques into strategy and business model innovation across a wide range of industries. \n\n\n**Why you are interested in being part of the Science Fiction Economics Lab (two paragraphs).**\n\n\nThe approach and objectives of the lab are closely aligned with my work and research. I am currently working on speculative designs and research papers without institutional affiliation. I also believe we will get further, faster if we work together and I appreciate the opportunity to combine my efforts with others. \n\n\n**What you would like to work on (maximum four paragraphs).**\n\n\nI believe there is an opportunity to reimagine corporate governance and board structures, the individuals they are comprised of, and how they measure success. This may include reimagining profit and performance, without necessarily discarding the concept of profit altogether. Though B-Corps and social enterprises are a step in the right direction, those structures are not getting adopted by multinational corporations \u2014 the worst environmental and social offenders. We need tangible transition pathways to the future that demonstrate how organizations might evolve beyond existing power structures. When possible, I would also like to create digital speculative design artefacts to communicate my insights and ideas broadly. \n\n\nI would also like to explore what a balanced economic system may look like, focusing on missing roles in society.

So, we partnered with  **[EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/)** , the European Union\u2019s largest climate innovation initiative. Together, we are organizing a  **Science Fiction Economics Lab** , to bring together SF authors, economists, technologists, activists and just ordinary citizens who care, like us, to to envision different economic systems. We are not interested in tweaks, one percentage point of budget deficit more or less. By \u201cdifferent\u201d we mean  *radically*  different. And these systems need to be  *rock solid* , not some kind of delusional fantasy good for another round of electoral promise.\n\nWith this effort we are working to co-create a template for re-energizing society\u2019s capacity for designing paradigm-level reform; help raise the awareness of the climate crisis as a carrier of opportunity and hope, and not just of disruption and dismay; and embolden would-be reformers, especially in Europe. This space is what we are asking you to support. In 2019 we prototyped the idea in a barebones format, and started building a community around it. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/klH0QbIhBEg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### A team of researchers to help us turn our conversations into collective intelligence\n@amelia @Leonie @CCS read all posts and conversation threads, then tag them. @Alberto then turns them into visualisations which allow us to get a bigger picture of what the conversation looks like. Together their work results in an easy to understand, visual overview of what connections people in the different discussions are making between experiences, topics, concepts and initiatives. These videos we made for a course give a good idea of what this involves:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410069933\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410071707\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIf you want to learn more about this, get in touch with the crew by introducing yourself in the open research workspace: https://edgeryders.eu/c/research-network\n\n### Experienced community managers\n@johncoate @noemi and @MariaEuler help ensure the space is welcoming and inclusive, connect people across shared interests and help move the conversations forward towards action. But what do we mean when we say \"community\" and \"community management\"? Again some materials from a course we developed to teach others how to do this:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410087848\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410075559\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Always-on video chat meeting rooms\n\nThese are intended for things like running online events where you need breakout rooms, running team meetings or even for just hanging. They are only available to people with [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) accounts. If you want to create your own you can do so by posting a request in a comment below. We will follow up with a few questions in a direct message to be sure everyone is aligned in how the room is to be used and then open a room for you. [Example here](https://now.edgeryders.eu/room/community?fbclid=IwAR1GMjc6SCd9ASrD4E8nDfA1afWvzvMCkHWZ__prp6RgS-f6psfRhF2s6U0).\n\n### Active Online Community Forums with built in sensemaking tools\n\nRelevant because: This enables us to easily connect with others interested in the same topics. Deepen the discussions. Build visualisations to show points of convergence with others as a foundation for potential collaborations around emergent insights.\n\n### Registration forms for events that smoothly onboard participants onto online forums\n\nRelevant because: we want to make it easy for people to connect and start the conversations before, and after the event. So that the webinars are part of a fruitful, action oriented process rather than something you just \u201cconsume\u201d. Example from previous event: [https://register.edgeryders.eu](https://register.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n### Tiered access online landing pages\n\n**Webinars or Screen videos with password-protected livechat.**  This is very useful for when you want to have different levels of access. For example you may want to limit access to people who participated in the preparatory conversations or participated in a previous activity. It is also useful if you want to do crowdfunding campaigns where one of the perks is to have one\u2019s questions featured during the webinar. Example here: https://live.edgeryders.eu/\n\n### Campaign builder\n\n**We have developed a stack of modules that enable you to quickly set up a single purpose minisite and it with relevant content** .This makes it easy and inexpensive to so things like set up a website around a specific activity such as conference or crowdfunding campaign. As well as present content picked from the online forum that enables your to feature discussion threads or high quality posts with little additional work. Everything is easily updated through the platform. Examples include: [http://er-campaigns.surge.sh](http://er-campaigns.surge.sh/), [work.edgeryders.eu](http://work.edgeryders.eu/), https://youthful-brown-c96bcf.netlify.com/ and [crowdfund.edgeryders.eu ](http://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n### We develop and use our own Open Source tools for sensemaking and co-creation\nAn innovative suite of online software developed, customized and maintained by Edgeryders. The software has been developed in cooperation with leading universities and deployed in projects for the World Bank, United Nations Development Program. It has been supported by Grants from the Rockefeller foundation and funding for Horison2020 research.\n\n**Open Ethnographer: helps you to understand how communities make meaning and create culture, from the point of view of the community itself**. It is an open source tool for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), which is a way to systematize and understand long chunks of text and to make sense out of it. OpenEthnographer is used for \u201ccoding\u201d or tagging the content of online conversations, with awareness of how each tag fits into the social network of interactions.**  It is a simple to use and intuitive tool that is key to other and more rich visualizations (ie through the use of Graphryder). Ethnography as always been a solitary science, Open Ethnographer is a new and scalable system that allows digital ethnography at an unprecedented scale, and because the goal of Ethnography is to understand communities make meaning and create culture, from the point of view of the community itself, OE is one of the first step to harness collective intelligence at work. It\u2019s developed for and by ethnographers, but can easily be taught to any community manager to keep track of an online conversation at depth.\n\n**EdgeSense: help you understand how much your community members are active and engaged in the conversation, which is key to understand different roles or project groups that could emerge during the period of activity.** It is a dashboard that allows community administrator to understand their community. It\u2019s organized around a graphical representation of the community where nodes represents users and edges represent interactions. **EdgeSense  helps you take decision on your community management. For example is it possible to highlight or hide the role of moderators, and understand how much the community is self-sustainable or need a push from the center.** Another possible analysis is based on the subcommunities that are active in and how dense the networks are between subcommunities. Analysis of nodes then help you understand how much your community members are active and engaged in the conversation, which is key to understand different roles or project groups that could emerge during the period of activity.\n\n**Graphryder: Helps you navigate conversations at scale and gain insight into your community because it maps out a graph of the view of the community about sets of topics, and it can lead to unexpected solutions or original point of views.** It is a dashboard tool that allow us to analyze the conversations that are happening in the community through reading of ethnographic data. Graphryder is based on innovative academic research which has led to publication in scientific journals. A dashboard represents conversations, and the fieldnotes made by researchers thereon, in network form. We call these networks semantic social networks, as they incorporate information on social interaction and their meaning. They encode a map of the associations between key concepts as perceived by informants as a group. Graphryder is what helps you navigate conversations at scale and gain insights.\n\n**DreamSense: Helps large distributed groups to co-create projects in an easy and transparent manner**. It\u2019s also the tool that will keep track of budgeting and fund applications. It is the Edgeryders version of the open source tool Dreams which has been used by participatory communities since 2015.\n\n### Training for using the methodologies and tools\nAcademy.edgeryders.eu\nThe curriculum for the OCI Lab & Documentation of all the webinars (see the  event announcements and \"follow up\" posts for Online Labs and Webinars here: https://edgeryders.eu/c/ocilab\n\n# Publications\n\n* Cottica A., Hassoun A., Salantiu N.

During my previous professional assignements I also had an opportunity to work on issues related to open science, open innovation and participate in civic consulatations and campaigns, which may be relevant for this project.\n\nI include the link to my LinkedIn profile, where you can find my CV https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnieszkapietruczuk/ but don't hesitate to contact me if you need more information!", "created_at": "2019-03-16 08:34:07.174556", "updated_at": "2019-03-16 08:34:07.174556", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 231, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 62.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51747, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 45, "raw": "Hello, again!

Social media can help tremendously in pushing the value of privacy and freedom to people as people's attention today is on social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ...). \n\nSocial media marketing, when used properly can educate people on the importance of privacy, knowing how to manage it (which a lot of people don't), and understanding what does it mean to have true web freedom. Of course, to achieve this education/promotion, you need GOOD social media campaigns that fit natively to the platform & and inform people in a way that they are used to getting informed on that platform (copy-pasting the exact same content across networks doesn't work, as we don't expect to find i.e random thoughts like on Twitter on Linkedin)\n\nRegarding ethical choices, I've always made sure that people's rights are respected, and that I never use any info about them to other purposes without their consent.\n\nFor Facebook and people dropping out of them, that is their choice. What's more important I believe is to watch what people pay attention to (i.e. which platforms). If a significant amount of people who need to know more about privacy and such topics move from Facebook to i.e. Twitter, that's where we should be.\n\n I don't think we'll see a 'new Facebook' soon, or at least in the next 3-5 years, as Facebook is still the biggest social network on the planet (even bigger when taken into account that FB owns Instagram and Whatsapp) and they have been pretty versatile in the past. \n\nI do believe that Facebook (and Instagram) and still the best platforms for pushing information about privacy & freedom, as advertising on it is still very underpriced (won't be all the time, same as Google Adwords used to be 5 cents per click, compared to today's average of 1-2 euros per click). Regarding saturation, there I agree that Facebook is full of various campaigns and various ads, BUT, if a campaign is developed that fits natively into the way that people browse Facebook (from images to videos), it can still get bit traction and generate results. This is also something that organizations and brands don't understand, so if Edgeryders would create a campaign that would fit social networks natively, it would achieve great results in my opinion", "created_at": "2019-03-24 16:56:11.755447", "updated_at": "2019-03-24 16:56:11.755447", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 439, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 75.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51985], "is_liked_by": [3, 4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48932, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9139, "post_number": 16, "raw": "I'm going to get back into the videos after the weekend.

Furthermore, over time, I have gained ability to manage complex projects within tight deadlines.\n\nI am eager to further my experience for the **NGI Forward** 2 project and ready to discuss this opportunity in an interview.\n*My resume and portfolio of competences can be read [here](https://3dadept.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190409-Kety-Sindze-CV-and-Portfolio-of-competences-.pdf)*\n\nYours Truly,\n\nKety Sindze", "created_at": "2019-03-26 22:20:24.621374", "updated_at": "2019-03-26 22:20:24.621374", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 334, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 9.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52158, "user_id": 4956, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 85, "raw": "@noemi Hi Noemi, I saw that you liked my application and I would love to know, whether it is taken into consideration and if my profile fits the requirements or not.

Introduction</h2>\n\nThis software is for creating forms that \u201ctalk to\u201d the Edgeryders platform and significantly simplifies the onboarding for new people.\n\nIt allows you to create any form that also can publish answers to a specific question onto a designated place on the platform. The answer is published under the person\u2019s Edgeryders user name on the platform if they already have an Edgeryders account. If they do not already have an account a new one is created for them. \n\nThis is good because it enables us to do things like connect event registration with creating your first post. Or follow up events by having people comment a specific piece of text e.g notes from one session in order to get something else e.g access to the whole event report.\n\nThis software is a front end application written in Vue.js that has the following features:\n\n* Loads form templates remotely from the Discourse platform\n* Include forms on other Webkit sites\n* Publish the response to the Edgeryders platform\n\n   * By authenticating the user through an existing account \n   * By creating a new account\n\n* Publish the response to Airtable \n\nThis manual will provide an overview on how to create a form that will work with our forms directory tell.edgeryders.eu\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Creating the form</h2>\n\nA form template is written in JSON. Before we start it is recommended to take a careful look at the default [example form](https://edgeryders.eu/t/example-edgeryders-form/14202), as it includes most of the fields and configuration options available.\n\n**Click here for a step by step guide [\"How to set up Edgeryders Forms for Dummies\"](/t/14230/9).**\n\n\n## <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Configuration</h3>\n\nThe first part of the JSON determines how the form is configured: specifically the form **title**, **introduction text**, **confirmation** text, **account** creation text, and finally where to **publish** the form response.\n\nBelow is an example configuration object:\n\n```\n\"config\": {\n    \"title\": \"Title\",\n    \"text\": \"Text\",\n    \"logos\": [\n      {\n        \"image\": \"edgeryders\",\n        \"url\": \"https://edgeryders.eu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"image\": \"https://live.edgeryders.eu/img/climate_kic.62d82854.png\",\n        \"url\": \"http://www.climate-kic.org\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"confirmation\": {\n      \"title\": \"Title\",\n      \"text\": \"Text\"\n    },\n    \"account\": {\n      \"title\": \"I'm new here\",\n      \"login\": \"Login button text\",\n      \"text\": \"Text to explain account creation step.\"\n    },\n    \"partners\": {\n      \"title\": \"In partnership with\",\n      \"logos\": [\n         {\n          \"image\": \"url_to_image\",\n           \"url\": \"url_to_site\"\n         }\n       ]\n    },\n    \"publish\": {\n      \"topic\": 14202\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nBelow is an overview of all the parameters available in the configuration block:\n\n|  Parameter  | | Value  ||   Description |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **title**  | | *string*  | | The title of the form\n| **text**  | | *string* or *integer*  | | The introduction text of the form. This can either be a string of text or the content of another topic on the platform. If you want to display a topic, put the `topic_id` of the article you want to display. For example: `14281` will display the contents of that topic.\n| **confirmation.title**  | | *string*  | | The title of the confirmation section (appears on successful submission of the form)\n| **confirmation.text**  | | *string*  | | The text of the confirmation section (appears on successful submission of the form)\n| **account.title**  | | *string*  | | The title of the account creation section (appears above the form fields)\n| **account.text**  | | *string*  | | The text of the account creation section (appears above the form fields)\n| **publish.topic**  | | *integer*  | | The `topic_id` of the topic to post the response to. This will publish it as a post to an existing topic.\n| **publish.category**  | | *integer*  | | The `category_id` of the category to publish the response to. This will publish it as a new topic. Overrides **publish.topic** if specified.\n| **publish.airtable**  | | *integer*  | | The `table_id` of the airtable database to post the response to, see **Posting to Airtable** for more details on how this is configured.\n\nThese are all the configuration options for the form.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Fields</h3>\n\nThe second part of the JSON template determines the fields and questions to include in the form. Each field determines an [input type](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) in the form. Currently the form supports the following input types: \n\n* [text](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_text.asp)\n* [textarea](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_textarea_form.asp)\n* [radio](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_radio.asp)\n* [select](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_select_form.asp) \n* [checkbox](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_checkbox.asp)\n\nBelow is an overview of all the parameters available in each `field` object:\n\n|  Parameter  | | Value  ||   Description |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **type**  | | *string*  | | The type of field, accepted values: `\"text\"`, `\"textarea\"`, `\"radio\"`, `\"select\"`, `\"checkbox\"`, `\"submit\"`\n| **title**  | | *string*  | | The `title` of the question\n| **text**  | | *string*  | | The `text` of the question, appears below the title or in the case of the checkbox, as the label of the checkbox\n| **placeholder**  | | *string*  | | The `placeholder` text inside the input field\n| **options**  | | *array*  | | Required for **select** and **radio** input types: the list of options to choose from \n| **required**  | | *boolean*  | | Set to `true` if this is a required field (the user must complete it in order to send the form)\n\nA typical **field** object looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"select\",\n  \"title\": \"Fourth Question\",\n  \"text\": \"Optional text for fourth question\",\n  \"options\": [\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\", \"option 4\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe `submit` **field** is an optional field for changing the text in the submit button:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"submit\",\n  \"text\": \"My custom button\"\n}\n```\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Publishing the form</h2>\n\nOnce you have completed filing in the configuration and fields, you can publish the topic. Once published, note the `topic_id` of the configuration topic - this will also be the ID of the form. You can now see the form published by going to [tell.edgeryders.eu](http://tell.edgeryders.eu)/topic_id. \n\nFor example, to see the example form with a `topic_id` of 14202, go to [tell.edgeryders.eu/14202](http://tell.edgeryders.eu/14202). \n\nYou can now share the form with others to complete.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Using with the webkit</h3>\n\nForms can also be displayed inside Webkit sites. There are two options for doing this. The first is to embed the form inside a `<Content>` section. To do this, use the `<form>` tag with the `data` attribute set to the `topic_id` of the form configuration. For example, to embed form `14202`:\n\n```\n<form data=\"14202\" />\n```\n\nIf you do not want the form to be visible on the page itself (it can take space and may not fit with the rest of the content), you can create a modal window that will appear on the page when a link is clicked.\n\nThe link must use the following markdown syntax:\n\n```\n[my link text](form:14481)\n```\n\nIn this example 14481 is the form id. Use the appropriate form ID to embed a modal containing that form.\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Step by Step guide for using forms for events</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. What are Edgeryders Forms used for with events?</h3>\n\nEdgeryders Forms provide an easy access to join the platform and a specific conversation both for new and sporadically present community members who still have problems navigating the platform.\n\n*  The idea is that the link to the \"form\" is the only instruction needed to get them onboarded to the event, conversation and platform.\n     * *Therefore an event form needs to include a description of the event that would serve as an introduction to the topic by itself and states that it is an event organised by Edgeryder + x collaborators.*\n* Filling out the form does two things:\n     * creating a new or logging into an existing account\n     * Posting a comment in a thread defined in the form template\n* The goal of the form is **not** to generate a list of participants for the event. Registered event participants are everyone who has commented in the thread the form links to for the output posts. The link for the call will be sent via pm to everyone who has commented in that thread, which automatically includes all the ones who filled in the form as well as those who already were on the platform. \n     * Therefore it is important to make sure to link the participant information sheet from the beginning in the post header that is linked to the outputs of the form *(question here @nadia, should we link that output directly to the event page on the platform (like this one for [Messina](https://edgeryders.eu/t/relational-goods-stocks-over-flows-systems-over-networks-a-webinar-on-the-strange-economy-of-the-messina-district/13534)) or create a new thread? A new thread could generate confusion, linking directly back to the event page would prob best?)*\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. The Output Thread</h3>\n\nThe form generates comments for a thread of your choosing. Make sure this thread includes:\n\n1. A link to [the participant information shee](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-calls-and-webinars-participant-information-sheet/13445)t from the consent funnel edited to fit the event in question.\n\n2. The lines: \n\n   * \"All who comment on this post will receive the link for the event call.\" \n   * \"Note that by attending that call you will consent to the recording and transcribing of the call for research purposes as described in the participant information sheet.\" \n   * \"Do not share the link to the call directly but rather share this link if you want to invite someone *(put the link to the form)*.\" \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. How to set up the form</h3>\n\n1. Go to the [example form / template](https://edgeryders.eu/t/example-edgeryders-form/14202), enter edit mode and copy all of the text.\n\n2. Create a \u201cNew Topic\u201d in the [Workspace and Webcontent-Sandbox category](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/webcontent-sandbox/349)\n\n3. Paste the copied text.\n\n4.  Now you can check the preview at https://tell.edgeryders.eu/ *new topic number* \n\n5. Redirect the output of the form:Change the \u201ctopic\u201d number in the configuration (for example \u201ctopic\u201d: 14202) to the number on the end of the URL of the **Output Thread** you created.\n\n6. Edit, copy, delete or adjust the texts in the different fields as you need and check the results in the preview. Remember to include an event description that could stand on its own on the top and mention the organisers (edgeryder + collaborators)\n**If you want to include the full text of an existing article or event post in the upper text area of the form, you can just enter the number of the topic and all of it will be displayed formated. [see example here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-possibilities-of-remote-working-comment-invitation/14299)**\n\n7. Once you are satisfied with your form, you can edit the WebKit page (like this one [Messina District Webinar - Webkit [XML]](https://edgeryders.eu/t/messina-district-webinar-webkit-xml/14241)) to include the form. > Enter edit mode in the WebKit post of your event and add/edit towards the end of the post.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. Obtaining e-mail addresses of respondents</h3>\n\nYou can obtain a list of the usernames and e-mail addresses of people who filled in the form, for example to send them event tickets or other communication you promised. Instructions:\n\n1. Make sure you are a Discourse moderator or admin, or otherwise ask a moderator or admin to do this process for you. (We cannot give access to this tool to others for privacy regulation reasons, because it enables access to the e-mail addresses of all users on the platform.)\n\n2. Visit the data explorer query \"[Users: topic contributors, with e-mail](https://edgeryders.eu/g/moderators/reports/30)\".\n\n3. Into the text field \"topic_id\", enter the topic ID of the form's output topic. This is the number you see in the browser's address bar when visiting the output topic.\n\n4. Click <kbd>\u25b8 Run</kbd>.\n\n5. Transfer the results to your e-mail software in any of the following ways:\n\n    * If you want to use bulk e-mailing software like Mailchimp, it is best to click <kbd>CSV</kbd>, save the CSV file and upload it in that bulk e-mailing software as a new mailing list.\n\n    * If you want to write an e-mail with Thunderbird (and possibly other e-mail clients, perhaps including webmail clients), the simplest option is to select the table cells with relevant addresses with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + drag (for one range) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click (to add or remove individual cells), then to copy this to the clipboard and insert it into the \"Bcc:\" address field of your e-mailing software. If all e-mail addresses are now separated with a comma (or comma and space), it worked. This looks good, for example:\n`alice@example.com,bob@example.com,charlie@example.com`.\n\nThese instructions rely on a custom query for the Discourse Data Explorer plugin. If you need similar queries to extract data from Discourse, you can have similar Data Explorer queries created for you. See our [Discourse Admin Manual](/t/6647) in section \"[6.3.

The reason is of course that in a hairy real-world organization, two people sometimes depend on each in a number of back-and-forth interactions, making it hard to define the direction of the dependency. For example, setting up a large power grid at a remote location requires radio coms, but the radio repeater station itself requires power. In the real world, this is not a big problem \u2013 you simply set up the power for the repeater station first, hook up the radios, and get going.

Breaking the responsibilities down into more granular pieces would often make the system noisy. \n\nHowever, making people aware of circular dependencies involving many edges that could potentially cause real problems, could be a good use case in a complex organization.

It is, frankly, not a real fairytale, because it is also about numbers and how they depict the spread of the corona pandemic. But since this is for many people a book with seven seals, here comes:\n\n*The bitter story of the imperious soap-boiler Exsder and his friend the box builder.*\n\n### Introduction:\n\nWe are in a small German town in the country-side. The good citizens usually adhere to the new distance rules. Schools and most shops are closed, some companies are still working. Only the coronavirus is busy jumping from person to person wherever it can. Most people stay healthy. A few become bitterly ill and die miserably.\n\n## And here comes the story of the soap-boiler:\n\n*It should help to illustrate how the coronavirus works, I hope:*\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a *soap-boiler* *,* called Lisder. When this story begins, he has 100 pieces of soap in stock. Every day he produces ten new pieces, which he brings to his warehouse to sell at the big spring markets in May.\n\nHow will its stock change in the next ten days? On the first, second, third \u2026 tenth day? It will grow 110, 120, 130 pieces up to 200. After 20, 30, 40, 50 days, he owns 300, 400, 500, 600 pieces. In May, he had several hundred pieces to sell. That is linear growth!\n\nThe case of the *imperious soap-boiler,* called Exsder, is different. He also produces soap. But he generates 10 percent of the stock from the previous day every day. On the day the story begins, he starts with 100 pieces of soap in the warehouse. On the first day, he has in the evening 110, on 2nd day 121, on the 3rd day 133. Then, 146, 161, 177, 195, 214, 236 and 259 pieces of soap. If he continues like this, then after 20, 30, 40, 50 days he will have 673, 1,745, 4,526, and finally 11,739 pieces of soap in his warehouse.\n\nIt is obvious: after a brief time, Exsder, the *imperious soap-boiler,* will be many times more successful than his colleague Lisder. In the first few days, the difference is hardly significant. There are only a few pieces of soap more than Exsder produces. But then: The production is picking up. The number of soap pieces is soaring! Every seven days Exsder\u2019s goods double, while the tranquil Lisder will have produced only 70 extra pieces of soap.\n\nHowever, both soap boilers have a problem at the door: where to go with all the goods? Luckily, the sap-boilers have friends who produce boxes to store pieces of soap. Usually, a box builder can build a box for 100 pieces every day.\n\nThat suits the *friendly soap-boiler* well: every ten days he gets his box and knows his goods well stored. The two, Lisder and his box builder, work perfectly together. One makes his soaps, the other the boxes, and both are satisfied. No soap lies around unwrapped. In May, the friendly soap-boiler can travel to the spring markets with five or six boxes of soap. And if they have not died, they still work and live today.\n\nThe *imperious soap maker\u2019s* case is developing differently. The box builder will deliver his first box on day 1. His second box is needed already on day 7, three days earlier, when the *friendly soap-boiler* needs his second box.\n\nThen it goes stroke by stroke. The next boxes are needed on day 11, 14 and 17. From day 19 to 25, the box builder has to produce a box every day. He only works for the *imperious soap boiler.* Then that it becomes demanding: to produce two boxes a day, from day 36, there are already three boxes a day needed, from day 40 four boxes a day. From day 50 the *imperious soap boiler* needs ten boxes per day.\n\nIt is not possible! The box builder does not know what to do, burnout, illness\u2026 and worse. From day 25, the box builder can no longer do the job, the pieces of soap pile up unpacked everywhere \u2013 and every day, there are more and more\u2026 The world is choking on the soap!\n\n*And so it is with this new infectious disease, the coronavirus.*\n\nThe number of infected people grows like the soap mountain of the *imperious soap-boiler* Exsder. At the beginning it\u2019s leisurely: Exsder has only produced every day a few pieces of soap more than his colleague Lisder. Translated from fairy tale into reality, this means that at first only a few people are infected. But soon it\u2019s all about!\n\n**And that\u2019s not a fairy tale.**\n\n*It is a simple calculation:*\n\nTrailer:\n\n*It is 29th March 2020 in the small town from which I report. On this day, 18 people are known in the small town who are infected with the coronavirus. That sounds comparatively harmless since the town has at least 20,000 inhabitants. In percentage terms, this ratio is currently German normality. If the number of 18 sick people in the small town were to be calculated and per 100,000 inhabitants, 90 people would be affected. But even that would still be within the framework. By way of comparison, in other regions, there are currently 300-400 cases per 100,000 people. However, the number of people who are infected but do not show symptoms is probably much higher in our case. That is a peculiarity of the coronavirus disease.*\n\n**Three observations can still be recorded:**\n\n1. In terms of population, the cases of the disease are minimal. That also means that there are still a great many people who can become infected.\n2. The virus spreads irregularly. That means that there are still many white spots on the map of infections where the virus may still appear.\n3. The number of cases in the affected areas can grow very sharply.\n\nThe third observation conceals the phenomenon of exponential growth. The first and second observations describe the conditions under which exponential growth can occur.\n\n**Exponential growth is typical of the growth of a large number of reproducers \u2013 such as a population of viruses, an algal bloom, or \u201chumanity.\u201d Contagious diseases are just one example.**\n\nWhat does this mean in terms of corona infections? Why are the figures that describe them so hard to grasp? Because our everyday experiences with growth have little to do with exponential growth. We usually experience linear growth. Who is already following the development of an algal bloom in a pond?\n\n*From soap boiling to the spread of the coronavirus.*\n\nIf there are 100 infected people in a population and the infection rate is 10 percent, these 100 people will infect in 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 days 259, 673, 1,745, 4,526 and 11,739 others. But how should they be treated by a doctor? How many hospital beds are available to them?\n\nThis problem of reality corresponds in the fairy tale to the problem of Exsder\u2019s box builder: You can\u2019t get along!\n\nOn the current situation, in Italy, the growth rates of people newly infected every day are 10 percent. Every seven days, the number of people infected there is currently doubling. In Germany, this is faster: it doubled in our case every five days until 29th March.\n\nThe growth rate in the region where our small town is located is closer to 13 percent than 10 percent. It has been stable for a few days. It is a simple prognosis. Given the case that on 17th March would be 100 infected people and the expected growth would be 10 percent, then the spreading of the infection would have to be as follows (The actual figures are in brackets):\n\n*18th March 110 (134), 19. March 121 (157), 20 March 133 (179), 21 March 146 (202), 22 March 161 (219), 23 March 177 (224), 24 March 195 (254), 25 March 214 (277), 26 March 236 (315) 27 March 259 (335).*\n\nBut the growth rate is higher than 10 percent, closer to 13 percent. With a growth rate of 13 percent, about 1/1000 of the population in the region were infected on 27th March. On day 50, the 6th May one in seven people will be ill: 58,277 people. If the growth rate remained at 10 percent from 18th March to 6th May, it would be \u201conly\u201d 11,739 people sick. That\u2019s 46,538 fewer people than the 13 percent forecast.\n\nAt the time of writing, the fate of the 356 people, which are identified as infected in my county, is as follows: About 85 have overcome the infection. One person died. Hence, the fate of about 25 percent of the people is known. About 10 percent of sufferers have to go to the hospital. Of these, one fifth is in intensive care. Today, the region\u2019s hospitals can provide for the people. However, if the current growth rate of coronavirus infections is maintained, the possibilities of intensive care in our region will be fully exploited in a few days. Then it gets tight. These are not fairy tales; this is mathematics.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n**The growth rate of infections must be reduced. Fewer people have to fall ill than in recent weeks. That is why we need \u2018social distancing\u2019 with all its measures. They reduce the likelihood that an infected person will be able to infect other people without any visible symptoms.**\n\nUncontrollably, the virus behaves like Exsder, the *imperious soap-boiler.* It is becoming impossible to provide the necessary supplies.\n\n**Measures such as quarantine and social distancing, as well as increased hygiene, slow down the spread and are therefore so important for the sick people to be taken care of.**\n\nEnd of story.\n\n**Please stay at home!**\n\n# Please stay at home!", "created_at": "2020-03-30 15:02:51.896907", "updated_at": "2020-03-30 15:11:50.416509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1675, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 97.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 3, 2915, 5, 6370], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46184, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8843, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@muredduf our colleague at the Lisbon Council recently shared this call with me as potentially interesting for us to consider.

Moreover, the health and wellbeing of EU citizens and consumers are directly affected by the way cities and regions themselves are shaping a sustainable food environment. **Research and (open) innovation co-created with citizens are part of broader city-region food system approaches**. ...Demonstration and first application in the **market of innovative solutions, co-created with citizen and cities with the involvement of public authorities, economic actors and non-profit organisations**, could be one way to support sustainable food security in cities.\"\n\n> \nSCOPE:\n> \"The proposals shall **identify several food-related innovative approaches based on citizen science and engagement, to be practised in cities to foster sustainability of the food system**. Proposals shall explore and share the application of these approaches in a wider range of European cities and shall be built on results of existing research, best practices and existing platforms and programmes. Proposals could comprise activities such as prototyping testing, demonstrating and piloting in a (near to) operational environment, as well as experimental production, all with a view to subsequent replication and application in other cities. Proposals shall **include the development of a classification and assessment of the benefits (economic, environmental and societal) of existing approaches for dissemination purposes, accessible online.** Proposals may include limited R&D activities and a clear focus on validating the benefits of pilot activities for citizens with a view of increasing engagement and replication. The action shall cover cities in rural and coastal areas and urban agglomerations. Proposals shall also **include co-creation between social innovation and technological innovation**. Following the **RRI principles**, proposals will ensure that societal actors work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align both the process and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society. **Active participation of municipalities and SMEs is strongly encouraged.**\"\n\n> **IMPACT AREAS** where I think we could hit well: \n>  * \"... Intensified interactions between all actors in the food chain such as research, (small scale) food production, city municipalities, education centres, consumers and citizens in the medium to long term;\n>  * Empowered local communities by using their potential to contribute to ensuring food and nutrition security at city level, which in turn supports the relevant SDGs;\n>  * Increased participatory and citizen science initiatives in the area of food and nutrition security in cities...\"\n\nWhat do we think about potentially brainstorming a concept and building a consortium?

I often have written about human evolution here at Edgeryders. There were great discussions with Maxime Lathuli\u00e8re and Jorge Couchet. Maxime and Jorge are aware of a 'cutural evolution', but nobody has venture so far as to say that we, Mankind, are still in the process of evolving.\n\nI have a rather optimist vision of the future and of human evolution. I wish that people were more aware that we are in a process of evolution. I think that if people had a clearer picture of this process, there wouldn't be as much loom. There would be more hope. It would probably also push people to change their attitudes. For instance, this current crisis, it's perhaps not the best and most fun time to live in, but if you look at from an evolutionary angle, it's an awesome opportunity for human beings, a great process of transition, leading to reshaping systems and to profound social and institutional redesigns.\n\n3 axes and 3 constraints, why not?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-27 19:23:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.606043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77940, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13735, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:1, topic:13735\"]\n3.

Edgeryders being what it is, it is only appropriate that some of our effort goes into \"blue sky\" thinking. This can inspire the way people in the broader community build their lives (myself included), and tends to draw interesting crowds.  Plus \u2013 and importantly \u2013 it is in general a lot of fun.\n\nThere is an important idea that is not receiving enough attention: the economic foundations of a modern society (let's say late 21st century). All I am seeing being discussed is minor tweaks on capitalism-with-state-corrections. This was not always the case: in the 19th century we had attempts at sweeping paradigm design (Marx, Proudhon, anarchic collectivism and mutualism), as well as prototypes (Fourier's Phalanst\u00e8res, Owen's New Lanark, and, later, Adriano Olivetti's Ivrea factory as the economic engine of the Community Movement). \n\nWe seem to have lost this alliance between top-notch economists like Marx and bold entrepreneurs like Owen in imagining possible alternative organizing principles for the economy. And that's a shame: even if we do not want to change our economic system, there's something wrong in not even being able to imagine anything else. It makes society more fragile.\n\nThe one exception I am seeing is a small cadre of science fiction authors. Exhibit A is Cory Doctorow, who is definitely economics-literate (see [here](http://www.cottica.net/2010/08/30/leconomia-di-makers-di-cory-doctorowthe-economics-of-cory-doctorows-makers/)). His recent _Walkaway_ (see [here](/t/7633)) comes closest to painting a picture of a completely different economic system. There are a few others: Bruce Sterling; Neal Stephenson; and, partially, William Gibson and Peter Watts.\n\nI would like to organize a \"blue sky\" seminar bringing together some of these authors; some professional economists willing to play ball; and some entrepreneurs who are experimenting with enterprise-scale economic models. There is no immediate goal other than the pleasure of having an interesting conversation with interesting people. It should probably be crowdfunded; crowdfunding is itself time- and resource-consuming, so we can only afford to go ahead if we find a lightweight way to get it going. I, however, would be willing to do work on it. \n\nI suggest this would be a smart move for Edgeryders now.

I don't know if you are aware, but I was the Director (called Indendant) of Bruxelles/Brussel 2000, when the city was last European Capital of Culture. Also as @alberto knows, I have been very involved with the ECoC project since it's inception. I was the Chair of the ECoC jury for 4 years, and have been the adviser to over a dozen cities who have won the Capital of Culture title. I also did a report for the Commission (2005) evaluating 40 ECoCs (called the Palmer Report https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/document-library/capitals-culture-palmer-report_en\n(There are two reports - one general; one of case studies).\nI have a lot to say about Brussels and the issues that will arise both at the bidding stage and if Brussels wins, as well as about the competition as a whole - and the politics behind it. @yannick I suggest you try and find a copy of our original concept for Bruxelles/Brussel 2000, and the very honest evaluation report I wrote (never published - too honest!), which are probably buried in the archives of La Ville de Bruxelles. You will be surprised how close some of our ideas and themes were to yours now (almost 20 years later) - and the projects we conceived to help realise them, many sabotaged or only partially successful. It was the politics behind the project that was a complete nightmare!\n One initial bit of advice for all aspiring ECoCs - if you don't have the politicians behind you, and formal backing (including financially) of the 'city' (in Brussels complicated with the commune structure), and in the case of Belgium - of the two (three) communities - even more complex - you will be lost in my view. That is why cities like Mons or Liege, or Leuven or Ghent have always had the edge - because of their relative simplicity. It took me about 10 years to get over the Bruxelles/Brussel 2000 experience (I lived in the city 1997-2006)! \nI quickly glanced over your Rapport de consultation BXL2030. Brought back memories, I sometimes tried to forget. I certainly applaud the ambition and the creative approach to the 20th commune of Saint-Vide-Leegbeek. Great idea! You now have a 1000 hurdles to jump over if the bid is to be credible and deliverable.

One of these, The Wellcome Trust (https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding) funds areas of the arts that reach into public engagement and arts fields as ways of improving health.\n\nI wondered if there was an opportunity for Edgeryders to develop a grant that brought together the OpenCare strand with those of us on the cultural side (not that we're really that separate) as a way of developing something (perhaps a offline public engagement project) that can feed into the strands being developed around mental health improvement.\n\nThere are certainly studies that show that engagement with the arts have a sustained and positive benefit on all aspects of mental health, and i've also seen brilliant theatre work that works across a variety of disciplines.\n\nThere are a few platforms out there that allow us to engage with similarly interested parties in the field.\u00a0\n\nhttp://thesickofthefringe.com/ - provides a platform for finding new work that supports companies developing and showcase work in this area.

What drew you to think about natural products, do you yourself use natural products?\n2. Which kinds of natural products are the most popular in your town or city? In your country?\n3. Where and how are these products grown or produced? This is important to know because then you know which suppliers you need to make a good offer to. *For example I think I heard that in Morocco argan oil is often produced by women in social cooperatives - so you would need to go to talk to them to find out about pricing, what troubles they face and what you could help them with.*\n4.  How and where people who are interested in natural products are currently getting hold of them? \n5. What are the difficulties of the people who are currently producing and distributing these natural products facing?\n6.

The post is impressive. @matthias has been thinking a lot about high-latency computer networks for application to rural Nepal, and I see his arguments coming to life in Rusty's words:\n\n> Understanding New Zealand's geographic isolation is necessary to understanding why SSB came into existence. Birthed from the brain of Dominic Tarr, SSB was originally an attempt to cope with New Zealand's unreliable internet connections. Instead of thinking that this roadblock had to be overcome, Tarr &amp; soon others developed a way to network using localization &amp; disrupted connectivity as foundational concepts. ([source](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://sdf.org:70/0/users/rusty/Post04-ssb)) \n\nI am fascinated by the trade-offs that Rusty mentions (I experience them myself, I have used SSB for almost one year now). Since posting is permanent, you are discouraged from posting in anger. My client (Patchwork) wants you before each post, and asks for confirmation. This generates friendly, \"sober\" thoughtful responses. People go out of their way to get closure of anything resembling conflict. But then, no, you definitely do not own your data if you cannot delete them. \n\nIn the end, he proposes that the best use for SSB is to keep track of interaction with local groups:\n\n> Instead, I see its greatest potential as  being a tool for aiding communication between individuals in a closed network. [...] SSB would make for a great tool in a closed network because everyone's information is stored on each other's computers. There would be  no corporate spying or targeted ads. Since you avoid outside servers & could even avoid the internet, the rules of discourse could be negotiated by the active participants. In other words, SSB could help maintain autonomous digital spaces at a time where they are rapidly disappearing. \n       \nIn Edgeryders, this function is fulfilled by:\n\n1.

It is best not to keep identification information if you don\u2019t have to. If the consent form is the only piece of information that would attach someone\u2019s name to the study, you don\u2019t collect names with consent forms.\n\n4. If you want to be extra safe, get verbal consent at the start of the call, and write down that you received that. Write the number of participants and note that they all gave consent.\n\n## This leads us to treat consent as follows for now:\n\nA) **For research on edgeryders.eu:**\nParticipants go through the platform consent funnel during their signup process. This clears them to make posts and be included in the research with their username as the only information we use (https://register.edgeryders.eu/).\n\nB) **For the summit pre-events, community calls, listening sessions etc.**\n\nDifferent registration funnels are being used which collect participant information - most importantly emails: \n\nForms such as: typeform.com or airtable.com\nFunnels such as: https://covid19-summit.netlify.app/#join\n\nThe purpose of the funnels is to onboard participants on edgeryders.eu ahead and after the events.\nSuch events are sometimes recorded on the spot (with participant verbal permission) but the recording is not used for ethnographic analysis, only to support note-taking by 1 participant.\n\nTherefore, we assess that registration funnels for online events which generate data that is not being coded and assigned to a person do not need additional consent.\n\nC) **For video calls, we will just set up registration funnels that make sure that everyone who is in the call has seen and agreed to the [consent info sheet](https://edgeryders.eu/t/13445) text about recording the call for research purposes.** We do it this way because it requires more text for recording and this should not be slammed into the general registration as the text to consent becomes too long and it is also irrelevant for most participants. It is however always relevant to those who want to join the call. Therefore, the videos call registration consent funnel in accordance with the needs described above:\n\n# 1.

No, I do not consent to the recording and can therefore not attend the call.\n\n\n* Email settings: Remember to change the email to the one of the hosts, so you receive the signup notifications.\n\n* Example:\n> Hi there, \n> You are invited to a Zoom meeting. \n> When: May 25, 2020 02:00 PM Brussels \n> Register in advance for this meeting:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0qd--gqDovH9KWERIuKhnH3WMJGC_a6VUj \n> After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.\n\nNB: If we add the webinar add-on (40 euro per month, we could customise the registration a bit more and invite \"view only\" guests who can not speak or share images, which would mean that we could share links for such a thing more publiclly)\n\n# 2. zmurl.com:\nZmurl is a new tool which is currently free, but will be a paid service in future (e.g. they will not finance it via selling information) https://zmurl.com/privacy-policy.

Data Terra Nemo is a conference to bring together the community developing open source protocols and clients for decentralized peer-to-peer applications. A very simplified introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the technology: Decentralized web applications are hosted without traditional servers. Instead, every client is both a host and a client. You can often still access these sites from traditional browsers, thanks to that many of them have been implemented in javascript. This shift allows for a lot interesting applications, and this is the scope of Data Terra Nemo.\n\nMany of the sessions touched upon the current challenges of decentralized technologies.\n\n## Blindly hosting information for others comes at a cost\n\n'Gossip' protocols like Scuttlebutt allows applications to share a pool of messages between users that are connected to each other. These messages are then interpreted by client applications, which can be social media applications, book recommendation services, chess games or private messages. I wrote a separate post about Scuttlebutt, and I am quite inspired by the community which has grown up around that technology. Largely because of the human-centric values of the core developers it has a unique feel and has attracted a big community for being such a bleeding edge technology. My reading of the role that Scuttlebutt plays in this space is that of the experimental avant-garde, the playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. Dominic Tarr, original developer of Scuttlebutt, had an interesting reflection on his own modus-operandi that I think has translated into Scuttlebutt itself, which is to \"not build the next big thing, but rather build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don't have to maintain it\". And it turns out that the developers of Scuttlebutt are working on problems that affect a distributed technology at its core.\n\nOne of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that I can host data for other people on the network without being connected to them directly. I can also host data on my own computer that is encrypted communication between users that I am  connected to. This is a feature that is very useful in situations where Bob sends a message to Alice, who is in a country where traffic to the outside internet is highly restricted. If Cindy, who has the privilege of a VPN connection, is connected to both Bob and Alice, then Alice will receive the message from Bob as soon as Alice and Cindy connect to the same network. Cindy doesn't even know that she is carrying a message between Bob and Alice, as both the message and the information about who is talking is encrypted. This is possible because, by default, everyone replicates the entire message stream of their entire network. In fact, many people replicate every message in their networks *2-3 hops aways from themselves*.\n\nThis creates some challenges. If Hans is in your network and connects to Lars who is a neo-nazi connected to a group of other neo-nazis, you might actually be acting as a server for information that you would really rather not propagate. This is not a hypothetical case. There are already known instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt as their preferred means of communication. Luckily for people that don't want to deal with them or host their information, they are still quite an isolated part of the network and prefer to keep it that way. Nevertheless, it only takes that one well connected person on their network-island  connects to another well-connected person in the Scuttlebutt mainstream for that isolation to be broken.\n\nScuttlebutt has tried to solve this with giving users the ability to block accounts they find abusive, but for those replicating data from a large network, they might actually never know who is posting that content. One solution that has been talked about is subscribable block-lists. This way, I could outsource blocking to a person or group I trust to maintain a block-list. \n\nLuckily, the most worrisome case of abusive photographs and other image content is not as big of a problem. Images are only downloaded to your computer when your client actually sees them, making it clear to you that foul content has made it into your stream. You might still host links to those images without knowing, but you are not likely to have images on your hard drive that you have never seen.\n\nBottom line is that the community of Scuttlebutt is charging head first into the future, working on challenges that many more will be facing as the benefits of these technologies reach more hands. Distributed systems are both democratizing and empowering, and they come with a whole new set of possibilities.\n\nI'd love to hear perspectives from @elch, @zelf and @hendrikpeter on this.

Delighted to see you here.  I have a couple of overlaps with the orgs and links you mention above - by coincidence I had just downloaded worldbrain yesterday..am just checking it out now.  Sourcefabric reminds me of The Coral Project, a US-based open source toolkit for journalists, to whom I did a bit of advising, and a good friend of mine, Dan Sythe, is on the Safecast team.  Dan invented a low cost radiation monitor that is used quite a bit on monitoring here on the west coast of California and his company, International Medcom, supplies many if not most of the radiation detectors Safecast uses.  Dan and I go way back...to a commune we both lived on in the 70s.\n\n(As a digression, since everyone here loves a good hack, Dan came up with his design for a low-cost radiation detector back at the commune by hooking a geiger tube to a heartbeat monitor, and voila!)\n\nRegarding climate change and its companion disaster, mass extinction, I increasingly see everything through that lens, especially politics, policy, technology, energy, etc etc - all of the above.

And I'm also a fellow with the Mozilla Foundation.\n\nPeter  0:10  \nThank you. This is against the background of this NGI Internet of Humans project. In your practice, you come from a design research background where you do a lot of design research these days and think about how that applies not just to to physical products, but to connected products. \n\nWhat was your journey? How did you actually get there? You did engineering, you did some AI stuff, you did a lot of design research, how did you end up bringing it all together in in this space around IoT-connected products and connected services?\n\nJon  0:43  \nThat's a good question. It's something I'm constantly shifting focus on. Essentially, I've always, in my professional life worked between electronic engineering, and product design and primarily interaction design. And actually, the thing that brought me into product design, and interaction design was really that these all have electronics in them, especially if you're thinking of the late 90s. Pre web as we know it. But effectively, electronics were the things in products that did the human interface, and then they converted that into electrical impulses. That was a radio, you press a button, it will change the channel for you. And the channel was in something electrical. So it was humans and technology coming together. And I've always done that. Flitting between them and at times I will emphasize more of the technology research. And at times more of the human aspect. Increasingly, I'm finding, maybe because I'm getting older, that it is harder and harder to differentiate the fields of engineering and design. Actually, I think the lines are getting more blurry.\n \nThey're getting way more blurred, because what the internet did was tell everyone they could make something. And that was the spirit of Mozilla, actually, in its earliest days was everyone can make something. And you know what? People listened. And so Arduino said, How can we do that?And Mozilla was saying things like web maker and other tools, and then log on and see all the stuff to get people making. And a real spirit of processing was one of the big founders of this. So we're all told we can make stuff, right? And so we did. And I then started teaching that to students in between design and technology studies. And computer science and engineering students would pick up an Arduino and realize that this was amazing. And they could do so much with it as much as a product design or an interaction design student would, or jewelry student or textile student right now. \n\nPeter  3:05  \nis it because the lines got more blurry? Like you have these bridge building kind of technologies of platforms, almost that kind of connect to these different roles.\n\nJon  3:14  \nYeah, and same thing with 3D printing. Rapid prototyping is natural. These used to be engineering tools. They were like CNC machines. And that they would sit next to the CNC machine as another way of doing engineering parts. But of course, they slipped into art schools, and they slipped into people's bedrooms, almost unnoticed. And suddenly the thing that was an engineering thing was suddenly some making thing. Suddenly, people who make things are not just engineers, they're all sorts of people. And I think, again, these hybrid bridging technologies are enabling people to do things in this way. So there is a blurring reality.\n\nPeter 3:59  \nYou mentioned things slipping into our schools and bedrooms. That the narrative of things slipping into bedrooms also, of course, is one you hear here often when you talk about why systems like Alexa, Google homes, all these kind of things, how, and this is like a very different kind of dynamic, because they also slip into all parts of our lives, but they're not making tools.  They are not creation tools, they're consumption tools. In the most benign reading right, or surveillance tools in the more maligned reading.\n\nJon  4:34  \nSo I think there's a really big distinction to make here about tools for making. So in the 90s, there was a big respected trend for bedroom DJs. And all the big names now that flood the circuit, and huge clubs all over the world - they all started in a bedroom. Because there wasn't a college of this, there wasn't a way to do this, where you learn what's in this. And they also went to art school.  So if there's a bedroom as a space for making, and it's yours, and you own that and you control it, and no one's gonna tell you you can't. And I think that's where these edgy, potentially paradigm-shifting is where Microsoft came from. Originally it's where Apple came from. And that's very different from consumer products. Coming into the bedroom and the things that are, for me, not things that should be put in without serious caution. And we're actually having the same thing I think with the thing about garages or the extension of a garage or your home, or your local street. Suddenly, even these last few weeks, where did all these E-scooters come from? And why was the one parked next to my bike this morning,  Before we move it, I couldn't physically move this thing. And it's blocking my way. It's really weird. And I've seen kids around the park bobbing around on this thing last night, They were neither over 14. Nor aware of any road safety or laws that you weren't allowed to have them in parks, and you had to be over 14. So I checked.\n\nThese things are happening in different contexts in ways that we don't know. You know, you might say scooter: mobility. I might say mobile mapping device. Hugely invasive. That thing now knows from just the behavior of how it's been spun around or stopped then someone else with a different way getting on it, it's been around. So that's really for teenagers. And this is the point of the part of they are and these are, that's very different from going from a middle class neighborhood area at eight o'clock every morning. I get into an office district, right in the morning.  So it's different contexts and different ways. So surveillance is now so hugely, I don't know transformed, it wears so many clothes now that it's impossible to see. \n\nPeter  7:00  \nLike the William Gibson quote where the street find its own use for technologies, but it's always like, almost like the surveillance capitalism finds its own use for the streets.\n\nJon  7:13  \nYeah surveillance, whether it's even spent it's capitalism. Yeah. surveillance is is just like the quote from Jurassic Park  where it's like nature finds a way. Yeah, I think surveillance finds a way. And I think humans want to extend the reach of their sensors all the time. And they want to do this for good. And they want to do it for harm.\n\nPeter 7:35  \nSo how do you explore these questions? There's like a bunch of inherent tensions in these fields  right between, say, convenience and privacy and, and across many, many dimensions, this is like a minefield full of potential friction, right? How do you explore that?  I know that once you helped commission a video together with Super Flux, and the extended opened-up IoT Studio to network around different personalities, different roles. Can you explain a little bit how that works and why you were doing that?\n\nJon  8:12  \nYes, there's two things. One, from my perspective it's a very powerful tool in. understanding the implications of technology in the future, is to give people as near to an experience of being in the future as possible. Now, that doesn't mean putting on a VR suit, stepping into the future at some VR cave in a very expensive lab. \n\nActually, for me, it is storytelling. And science fiction writers have been doing this for the last 120 years.  You brought out a William Gibson quote. We could bring out George Orwell.  We have all these imaginative ways that people tell stories. And design is another very powerful way of telling stories, when coupled with filmmaking. So designs that can make props, near or far future technologies that can affect appear in a narrative. And it doesn't have to be a blockbuster science fiction narrative, like lightsabers, or Harry Potter ones, this can actually be domestic, ordinary, rather dull futures, the kind of futures that we're really going to inhabit. The future is going to be just as domestic and dull as it is today.  The question is, can it be the domestic and dull that we want, or the domestic, and dull that's been forced on us that we don't want. And that's where making these films that can reveal in playful domestic ways, maybe there's a little humor, because people understand more with humor, if you can get across concepts. And what we wanted to do in that film was to translate the research findings and complex conversations we had on a research retreat for five days, this is really important process for navigating the futures.  Ask experts.\n\nHow do you get this messy, lots of posting those lots of conversations, lots of notes, lots of typed documents into something that was understandable. So one of the people that came was this filmmaker, founder of Super Flux. And we asked her to work with us, and us being University Dundee and Mozilla, to create a film around the future, the voice, which is a topic we were discussing in Bellagio. So that film is an embodiment of some of the snippets, and thoughts and reflections we had during and after this five day research retreat.\n\nPeter 10:55\nSo you gathered a bunch of experts, identified issues, challenges, approaches, then you had professional kind of speculative design fiction people turn that into a more graspable kind of tangible thing and the result was this video called Our Friends Electric. And it showed essentially three different personalities of voice assistants. One was a pretty controlling kind of nanny, like thing that would always ask you to do things. And other one was a kind of quirky, critically socialist, Marxist kind of approach. And the third was just having control of your voice.  So it would actually be a standard. And if you had to call like a phone hotline or something, and it would negotiate on your behalf, and you could just like give it basic back parameters, like, he wanted to have a choice. \n\nJon 11:45\nDo you want it to sound frustrated?  Do you want it to sound relaxed? Do you want it to sound funny? Or do you want to sound serious, you know, we wanted to embed all these and make them human controllable.\n\nPeter 12:00  \nAnd especially the one where you control the emotion, I found that really fascinating, because the idea to have to be explicit about what emotion you want to display right now is so inverse from how we usually experience where oftentimes I think we're surprised, by our emotions rather than, Oh, now I want to be angry. Yeah. Flip the switch be angry now on my behalf. So I don't have to. That's fascinating.\n\nJon  12:22  \nYeah. And also, if only you can turn yourself down, right. You know, like people say, tone it down a bit. Yeah, I think you have a tongue control. Right. And that was where that started to come from. And we also wanted the reality of conversations to happen. So there is a term in English, the saltiness, from sailors in that particular language, and sailors may or may not use it in myth and legend and reality. And that saltiness on the BBC is allowed to appear after what's called the nine o'clock watershed. So if the BBC made voice assistance, could you imagine the same watershed suddenly, after nine o'clock? \"What do you want me to fucking play now?\"\n \nPeter  13:14  \nI really love this movie. What were some of the feedback you got? Or maybe were there some surprising insights when you showed us other people like how they reacted?\n\nJon  13:22  \nYeah. So what was interesting is we wrote to them for this research paper, so we went back and evaluated. It's published in <Chi?>, and we need to reference it for this, I can send you the link. But a lot of the reflections and findings were shared, I think, with both these two groups as as personal reflection, so what was it like to have this film out there for a year two years and show it to students, design fairs, and events happening in the real world? Personal reflection is so close when six months after we made the film, where a voice assistant can make a call on your behalf. Google Duplex place was announced. I mean, it's interesting announced it since then \n\nPetera  14:03  \ntoo much fanfare and even more pushback.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:05  \nYeah, exactly. And I guess we were six months, in a way ahead, we hadn't expected to be. But what it made me realize straight away was 'wait - Google Duplex didn't inform the caller it was an AI.' How terrible. That's disgusting. They shouldn't have done that. And that was the big debate.   So when our voice assistant was calling people, it wasn't saying Hi, I'm an AI. It was saying Hi, I'm a person effectively. That was wrong. \n\nThe chat's interesting, because then you have two bites. The cherry as it were. So you have these because you're forewarned you It gives you another opportunity that when you've made something you're probably more critical of it in the real world than when it's first out, so it enabled us to be more critical of what we'd done. It also said a lot of the things they were doing to make people human was still this sugar-coated humaneness. The politeness. It wasn't like, Hi. Can I make a telephone? For seven o'clock? Wait, what do you mean, you don't have? No, I want that. Come on. Come on. That's a reality conversation. Not everyone is polite and hesitant. But it's just more sugar coated.\n\nPeter  15:33  \nThis is a personal assistant calling on behalf of so it looks like the subservient.\n\nJon  15:36  \nI've been called by people's personal service assistants.  Tickets, maybe. Yeah. Someone who has more power over you. So the power relationship was really interesting.  So again, we were able to investigate the power relationship between humans and machines. Which we also did in this film. Something that's so important.  So we tried to enable this third film which we were showing how you might want to program a voice assistant to be the person I'd like come on, like, this one because you are monsters, or another type of person. See, what we are trying to show there was really this basic research by people like Daniel Dennett, that there are different forms of machine consciousness. But ultimately, they are representative of the Creator.\n\nSo everything has a an ideology.  And so what we wanted to show was that if you had a voice assistant, you might be able to adapt it to appear like a monster. But if it was run by a capitalist, like company like Amazon, the only real existence is to try and sell you things.\n\nPeter  16:47  \nWhich it ends up doing.  \n\nUnknown Speaker  16:51  \nExactly. You know that. And that's the surveillance economy coming back to that that's the ad economy. That's a suggestion economy. There's new silencing. Yeah. I think machines having ideologies need to be really clear. In an age of programability  we need to be able to do that.  And ultimately, machines will need to be accountable, right? accountable to the people that \u00dfcreated them, Not just having robot toys for robots.\n\nPeter  17:20  \nI think, if you if you think kind of in concentric circles, if you're a user, and you have a device doing a thing on your behalf, that's one thing, that's one relationship, right? Between you and the device, or the device maker, possibly quite likely connected, if it makes a call your behalf, like already affects a third party who might not have consented to it. So already, we're establishing a completely new relationship. And then there's, of course, all the outsourced kind of externalized costs and external hidden effects that we haven't even touched upon. And that's really a whole new rabbit hole and a huge, huge field, right? That's only slowly started get any attention.\n\nJon  18:01  \nAnd I think if you can look at the way in which a blockbuster movie enables you to convince you that this narrative is real, if only in a suspend your disbelief kind of way. But now we see with a deep faith in a very different what was fiction is now able to do this, yes, not just suspend your disbelief as I hold your disbelief, but in the wrong direction. These things with the same production values, and now going into changing your behavior, right, as they go into changing your mood during entertainment. Imagine those production values of the things that are coming to you.And that they will employ so many different techniques, embedded in different things. And I think, really important for the next generation of the internet is to really, essentially understand these these very powerful forces to start to name them. I don't think we know.  We call them advertising, but we don't know what they are really, it is new forms of controlling.  And and we've known that like that we need to enable people to take back control to be able to read, write, execute and participate to be not just consumers, but creators. But these need balancing against trust, opportunity, responsibility, ethics, and they need to be done in a way that's back to the person in control of this. And that's hard. Because if I put a 12 year old, like my kids in the car, when they were particularly younger, would love to be in control of the radio,  that's fine, but not gonna put them in control of the steering wheel. Yeah.  So we've learned so much around dangerous systems in the past flying, driving, manufacturing things, you know, where the safety standards are so much clearer, so much more understood and have been adapted into human customs and behaviors,\n\nPeter  19:56  \nbecause it had a lot more time to mature, I think\n\nJon  19:58  \nthere was slower, yeah, you know, bits of metal was slower to form and communication was slower. So the steam engine took a while to spread around the world. Train, travel and train tries to years to build across  \n\nPeter  20:12  \nAnd cars took a long time to become even somewhat secure even for the passenger, let alone the environment. \n\nJon 20:17  \nExactly. But also, the systems - control and manipulation - grew up with them.  I think what's happened with the big tech is that the systems of control and manipulation and law and lobbying and policy to enable your product to get to market and through government control are as hugely sophisticated as the automotive industry. They ported those same people into the big tech calls. But what hasn't been ported is a sense of safety, responsibility, workers rights, all this stuff has been jettisoned. And we require new understanding of what have we left behind rightly so for what are we left behind wrongly? What do we need to bring back on what new skills and things do we need for this very fast economy?\n\nPeter  21:06  \nHave you seen any promising approaches? Or do you have a gut feeling where you think how we could even tackle these large-scale change problems? There's a lot of talk about , generally speaking,  social media and all these wrong incentives and all these like public discourse platforms that lead to outrage rather than consensus, how that undermining democracy and the democratic process completely. So the tools are currently not that strong it seems to me.\n\nJon  21:40  \nThere's two things we have - two pieces.  One piece we've talked about, where you're able to make films and speculate about the future and tell stories about the future, in a very clearly produced way that is built on expert views from many, many points of view, gets written into a narrative by filmmaker and designed in order to show this to have many different lenses looking in the future. So we know how to do that.\n\nPeter  22:12  \nSo these are essentially objects that you can then coalesce a whole conversation around.\n\nJon  22:17 \nWhat we then could do is say, okay, we first will use experts to create this vision of the future. But then we need other experts to critique this.  So the piece we don't have, and that comes back to democracy and control is, we are seeing powerful emergent techniques around informed citizens, such as the citizens assembly. And actually another thing, which I found out three days ago with citizen juries, which are a more lightweight version, imagine 12 members of the public chosen at random, and who get  to cross examine experts. So could you imagine these speculative films about the future in a series of 12 or whatever number, get to basically see these films then interview the experts behind the films, also experts that present a counter viewpoint to the film. So in the case of Our Friends Electric, you would show these films, and these would be on trial, the future would be on trial. And then these 12 people come from all aspects of life, completely normal from all across Europe, let's say, Would then be able to interview the people behind the film who made it and everyone who went to Bellagio. They would also be able to call people who would counteract that. So maybe Google Duplex would be there saying what's wrong with this film? Why their duplex is better. And you could have someone from facebook say, okay, we don't have to go with a blown up thing. It wasn't what these researchers and the Guardian is saying, and have this thing on trial.\n\nSo why don't we put trust the data on trial? and show what that looks like? Let's show the crimes or the impact, right don't have to be crimes it just like, what's the future look like different visions for the future? And put them on trial. And before the problems have happened. So it's a kind of predicted, not predictive, responsibility.\n\nPeter 24:07  \nIt's participatory prediction.\n\nJon  24:10  \nOf future responsibilities and how we in the EU or globally can deal with them. So I'd argue that <??> should have been through this process before at least an amount that centralized in fields day in day out totally and have all the absence associated with that aren't going to be have the fingerprints run for a while. That's the only way of accessing the bank name that enables you to operate as a farmer and receive benefits, subsidies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So let's start to put these things in front of juries. And I think, why do we have these features? Why don't we know about this? Why aren't they just done in the background, or someone should have made a film about these real prototype as they've existed for ages. And they should have had, here's a film for the for the defense group, and here's a film made by the accusers, And he got these people and experts coming in and out. Can you imagine how that would look like? It would be amazing.\n\nPeter  25:11  \nIt would be amazing. Yeah.\n\nJon  25:12  \nAnd yeah, we're leaving things. Autonomous vehicles are gonna ride like scooters, everyone's gonna go. We read about these and we knew they were coming. But we didn't know they were coming next week.\n\nPeter 25:23  \nAnd even if we did know that, then unless there's a way to actually participate in the decision making process it doesn't matter.  \n\nJon  25:33  \nCould you imagine like in the old days the cinema had the news before the film, could you imagine if you said, okay, you're coming to see science fiction, you're highly, highly, highly motivated by futures. And we're just going to show you the five minute film beforehand. And then everyone gets to vote on the future with a few questions. And could you imagine how that would be as an experiment - ways of putting things in front of people that start to use people's time more wisely.  \n\nPeter  26:04  \nThe other example is really great because at the very least, it surfaces that as an issue and the fallback plan like iris scans are a big problem for people with cataracts. But also someone will say  well, I don't trust it. I just want there to be a person to talk to because that also doesn't exist, like all the fallback plans. They always get scrapped. It's like, Oh, we have a new shiny system. So everything now works perfectly. But if then anything doesn't work entirely perfectly everything goes belly up. Everything comes to a grinding halt. \n\nSo you mentioned that the next generation is really important in this and you've started this PhD program called <opened up?>. What's up with that? How does it work? What's your goal with that, because to me, that's a pretty groundbreaking new thing, the way you frame these these PhDs?\n\nJon  26:55  \nI think it comes down to a simple, maybe naive observation the world and this was a response to a call, which is about identifying gaps in training, where you need seriously strong academic leadership, that have industrial experience to go into this gap in the training. And the gap in training, I can see globally. But some way Europe can foster it is the gap in the training of how we design for trusted objects within the internet. We don't know how to design for trust. We know, as designers, we might know how to design for reliability, we might design for speed, we might know how to design for people with poor eyesight. We know how to design for so many things. Yet, we don't have design for trust. \n\nSo we realize that this isn't something you're going to tackle with just putting up a 10 week course on a bachelor's program.  It's a graduate program that we needed this be an intensive training. And that's what we applied for. And we won the funding for. And that's what starting we're really looking at this trust, and the internet, across all the physical, different scales that the Internet of Things will be happening. Because on one level it's either on or in your body or medically or for pleasure or just life assistance. It might be in your home, it might be around your home, it might be the bedroom or kitchen. Have friends share things in homes. So the homes are important, as is the body. And also we're going to have a kind of informally, like networks and community level. So not the stuff that's happening by politicians. But we can blend together and say we want some technology in here. And then zoom out again, on the biggest scale, you have things city, this so-called Smart City, infrastructure debate and so on. And there, things are coming in a different way. And all this is calculated by trust, of which we now don't even know how to read this now, visually, or otherwise have been informed. So we have designed a program designed for trust.\n\nPeter 28:57  \nSo that's also what I really appreciated about this is the framing that I found really interesting.  But also you take a clear stand based on values. This is like a very opinionated, kind of program in a way. And it's not just like build sensors, build IoT stuff.  Make it trustworthy. That itself is such a strong frame.\n\nJon  29:18  \nWell, that's the kind of highway. We all have heroes and heroes. One of mine, John Sacra, he's had a lifetime  - 50 years of experience in journalism and design and technologies and big systems. And he just said recently, in an article in the magazine for us, he said, You know that for all these incredible sensors, and 50 sensor based and open source technologies that are emerging in the world, how much difference is that actually making to people? The iceberg's are still melting. And disasters are crashing even faster and closer. So while we're sitting there measuring and being all kind of very self congratulatory about this citizen science approaches, they're not making a difference. And they're really not. If it is well done, we would have been able to slow down this stuff.  \n\nI want to relate this to another piece, which is relating it to trust. And the next thing I think, which is if the next generation Internet has to comply with is all the other work that's going on around climate change and humanity. This is a human centered Internet of Things, or can we be a humanity and Planetary centered into that? That's not right. Let's not do an iteration, let's do a paradigm shift. So let's not do it to keep the internet things going, it's going to keep going. But let's not just make it more human, let's just make it serving the planet. And we already have a framework that's been discussed for years and years and years has been prototypes through the Millennium goals, and now has become the UN sustainability goals, so-called SDG, 17 of them, carefully planned so that by 2030, the planet will be in a better shape. So the thing I will ask as pushback is, isn't the next generation internet going to be here  before the next generation arrives? It's got to be compliant with the SDGs and how much work has been done? As far as I can tell absolutely nothing. So this has to be the priority area of designing for the SDG for the next generation internet. Plus trust,but plus the SDG.\n\nPeter  31:34  \nAnd that's, that's really strong framing because it makes it more easily relatable to policy, which I think is always a huge thing. I see people are now moving from the product thing to, Oh, actually, we need to always go upstream. And one more step,   what's the economic model and its policies around it? And what's the regulatory framework? That might be the the peak of that particular mountain,that peak of the stack where you go, Okay, look, if it doesn't fit in the framework of the sustainability development goals, then maybe it's not a thing we can be doing.\n\nJon  32:13  \nOn the surface, the CE sharing bikes, I know, look like something that has meets sustainable development, because they're going to have cleaner cities, they're gonna cleaner energy than, say, a car or a train or bus. But actually, if you really look at them, in terms of leaving no-one behind, behind this model leaves everyone, except the company owners behind it. So no longer can you repair these things. We both have bicycles, and I know without looking at your bike, I can take the saddle off my and put it on yours, if your brakes failed, I can take the brakes off mine and put it on yours, if your tire needed fixing, and I could take my punch repack it right and put on it to my bike and said, You need a good bike dealer. You could recommend the repair shop around your corner, and they will fix my bike without having to check which model it is.  Now, the sharing bikes with a circle sharing are doing the opposite. No parts are interchangeable is the trouble. You can't change the saddle, all the brakes, or the lights. So when my bike go bust, you have to throw everything on the mountain. So they are not meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. But they're not also they're not reaching the next generation internet goals. They're not reliable or trustworthy. We have no idea what's happening with your data. We have no idea what's happening to the communities that use these and so on. No idea where the app connects and the Bluetooth.\n\nPeter  33:53  \nBut we do know that none of them put a premium on privacy data protection, we do know that they don't do the same for sustainability. We do know that none of them make a point of say minimizing external costs through paying a fair labor, labor share something we do know they didn't have a business model. They don't have one. So that's why you see these explosion and then they all get gobbled up at the same one. It's like that's like the purest version of like the event the downside of the venture capitalist model. \n\nJon  34:24  \nWhat the problem is, is not that this is happening, that's just a result of that consequence. My problem is the only counter movements of protest ones, there's no lead by example. So we can have this next generation internet then let's have a set of values as defined by the UN sustainable development goals. And then let's start to create these stories and compare them right through citizen assemblies or citizen juries. Let's have a debate about this. So if you can say, here's a film made about E-bikes, so good from Lyft, or whoever's made them from Uber. And here's a film made by researchers and designers,  like as a counter narrative. Don't just leave them as opposition on Twitter and Facebook bubbles, bring them together, and critique and analyze and then draw the best bits out and use policy to regulate and inform so that these companies are not about eradicating these companies. It's about them being more informed, and evidence-based ways of making change.\n\nPeter  35:38  \nAnd also, I think, frankly, as someone who lives in one of the many cities where they just get flooded (with E Bikes), and one's neighbors get flooded with them. They're not good neighbors to have around. It's just like, it's essentially really expensive trash all over the sidewalks blocking my way. Like I said before, this is not this does not play well with the neighborhood at all. There's not a good interaction there at all.\n\nJon  36:02  \nAnd yet, what's interesting is that cars have had that model. Cars Park everywhere, but they've lived in cars.  \nin general, \"oh these E bike are ruining our streets.\" Why can't they (E bikes) be left in car parking spaces? They are not. If these are actually road bikes which are not actually allowed on the pavement. So I looked into this notion, was these E-scooters system not for the pavement. Yet, that's where they're all, not just parts, but all left by the companies that run them in a nice neat row. And overnight 20 of these are in front of your apartment on the pavement. Right now in a parking place.\n\nPeter  36:43  \nI would argue that not even the cars in our neighborhood are in car parking spaces. They just block the street. But just because one system has horribly failed, all the citizens but the ones that actually use them...\n\nJon  36:57  \nThe police or the parking attendant. Yeah, you could potentially call the police, say they are blocking you and move them.\n\nJon  37:02  \nYeah. So what do you do with E scooters?\n\nPeter  37:04  \nIn our neighborhood, a lot of them end up like in the river or on trees and sub optimal outcomes.\n\nJon  37:10  \n\"But that's not the company's fault.\" In quotes. \"That's the neighborhood's fault.\" Again, then you pitch the neighborhood against clean tech - so-called clean energies, and it ends up in a terrible place. So the future is not going to work out well for these things. And someone's going to get very rich somewhere in the world, but not in your community, I can assure you.\n\nPeter 37:29  \nI read this amazing thing from Deborah, who, in her newsletter just drops this one line, \"sustainability always looks like under extraction, when you compare it to extraction.\" And there's so much in that sentence, like if it's sustainable, it'll just not be as in your face, as the hyper growth model that we're so used to. And anything digital and globalized. That I found really interesting is like, Oh, yeah, maybe just like, seems a little slower, more, a little more humble in its approach that might not seem like it's a fantastic business model that scales from here to Mars. But it's something that we could keep doing without limiting future generations. \n\nJon 38:12\nAnd again, with these models, and we're trying to bring them back with other forms of resilient sustainability, you know, and ways in which we could do this, we still haven't got it right. Farming is still not a place that probably could ensure it, the lessons of history have been for now, of course, this is affecting wildlife all over the planet, because of these huge farms that have been grown from machines to harvest and marketers to sell not for people to eat and animals to live with. And again, flipping the framework, if we had all the farming meet the SDGs everyone would be fat, everyone would be fed,because that means that animals  and the environment would flourish with farmers. And we have to look at technology development in the same way.\n\nPeter  38:58  \nSo if I tried to like sum that up the key takeaways if I have it right would be that sustainable development goals should be the guiding framework for all that happens, the next generation internet and beyond. And participatory futuring, if you want to call it that, or, you know, participatory processes in evaluating futures would be the bottom of thing to help us guide within with the framework.\n\nJon  39:22  \nYeah. And I think to be to be a non evangelist in a space is one of many useful tools in understanding.  I'm not saying this is the magic effect. All I'm trying to propose is this form of future storytelling involving designers and filmmakers, is one  more incredibly powerful tool to add to many ways in which we academically and professionally evaluate the the world around us and propose futures. So I want it to be given due credit in a broad spectrum approach. Because it has to be right. No one method is going to find this future. It's just not going to happen.\n\nPeter  40:06  \nIs anything I should have asked anything you would like to add that I might have forgotten?\n\nJon  40:12  \nI think the main thing I do want to stress is that I don't think that pursuing technology standards first as I have seen, in the current NGI approach is going to do anything. I really don't. I think it is a really problematic approach. What we need is humans first, and the planet first. Then find, right, what standards and cultures and practice fit together in order to exist in that world.\n \nBut finding 5g 6g 7g finding HTTP, HTTP, s plus plus, wherever you want to call it. That's not going to happen. Because, humans and surveillance will always find a way.\n \nHumans will find ways of being more human. But if you put technology first humans will find a way find a way around it. Always.\n\nPeter  41:17  \nkind of a beautiful, both dystopian and kind of hopeful message.\n\nJon  41:22  \nAll these futures exist.  The future is a sphere not a line. And it can go in so many different directions. And why don't we just choose the ones we want to go. \n\nAnd the other thing I think about the future, which is really, really important. So this is the other thing I've talked about recently is: I could say to you there's the park next door to here, right next to the office, and I know a particular oak tree right round about the middle of that park. If I tried to describe that oak tree and ask you to navigate, you would probably get somewhere in the right part of the Park, because we could say that you'd really study and would get to some oak tree but you'd probably have one of a hundred chances of being at the right one. However, if I took you to that tree, right and said, find your way back to the chair, you're sitting on the resident office right now..No problem.\n\nMy argument for this speculative approach is: let's take people there, and ask them to walk back and see the consequences to where they are now.

You can find the article linked here and comment with your own thoughts and questions.\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/infrastructure-companies-as-platform-moderations/14284\n\nAnd we all worked together with the participants of the coworking event, programmes and people doing transcription and our great copywriter to filter and present to you the best quotes and ideas form the co-working workshop with 50 members from all over the world from coworking owners over technology providers to network builders.\n\nHere are 4 picks that I think might be especially interesting for you here in NGI:\n\n* [How to break the digital divide?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-break-the-digital-divide/14320)\n\n* [Coworking throughout Covid: First hand experiences from London, Dublin, Barcelona\n](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coworking-throughout-covid-first-hand-experiences-from-london-dublin-barcelona/14282)\n* [How technology can help support the recovery of the coworking sector](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-technology-can-help-support-the-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector/14323)\n* [The possibilities of remote working](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-possibilities-of-remote-working/14281)\n\nThank you for being a great community!\n\nLet\u2019s work together to keep warm, happy and busy in autumn.", "created_at": "2020-09-03 12:27:57.768589", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 12:27:57.768589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 327, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 48.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [82475, 82148], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61043, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11081, "post_number": 2, "raw": "**John**  0:00  \n\nWelcome Peter Bihr to our community call today. Delighted to have you. I don't know how much everybody knows about Peter and his work. But I spent a lot of yesterday reading your writing, your website, looking at all the things you do. You're a prolific writer, you have the ThingsCon conference that you've been doing, you have The Waving Cat, you do consulting, you're a young parent, you started a company that makes pants, you have a travel magazine that is kind of crowd sourced blog thing. What a renaissance man. Where do you find time to do all these things? \n\n**Peter** 0:41  \n\nWell, the good thing is, I don't have to do them by myself. So that makes it a lot easier. The things I do most of us basically just what you mentioned, the way we can, that's my company, that's essentially the administration little back end to make everything work. That's that's the consulting firm. And that makes it a lot easier. Thanks. \n\nCon is the other big project that takes the other half of my time mostly. That's a nonprofit, but that's a bigger team. So that, you know, that's not just me, that makes it easier. And the rest are kind of like side projects that were other teams, or are really like on a very like small slave. So that makes it a lot easier. It makes it sound more than that. It really is like the way the Cat the consulting part around smart cities and emerging tech. That's the commercial part. And the things con is the nonprofit advocacy part of the whole thing that started as a conference, and then turned into a whole online community where essentially, we work with a lot of professionals and practitioners in IoT to make sure that it gets done a little bit better, and not just faster and easier to exit later.\n\n**John** 1:40  \n\nYour current research focuses on smart city governance, what specifically Are you looking at with that?\n\n**Peter** 1:47  \n\nSo when we look at smart cities, like anything that's connecting the urban space, let's keep it like very open and broad for now. Anything that is internet connected or collect data sensors that enables administrations to run decision making algorithms, that kind of stuff, anything called Smart Cities, and - small footnote: I go through this whole spiel that that's all encompassing because the term Smart City is a very specific industry shape term is like it's essentially an IBM term more or less, that they kind of brought into the world. And like all the vendors that make smart cities acknowledges use that term. And it comes with some baggage. But I mean, whenever we connect public space, essentially, we, I think, need to look at how that works. Because if you look at my home, it used to be a private space; home in the in the global West used to be a private space. And now because we embed connected microphones, it's not so there's a phase change of some sort. And similarly, if you look at the public space, the moment we started tracking the movement of people through space, or we imply algorithms to make decisions about where to put the next fire station, or who gets to use which road or that kind of thing of who gets routed which which way that happens in public space. And unlike if I buy a naked gadget for myself, in public space, there is not opting out, if they want it or not. And so I think it's like this, the smart home was a face to face for privacy, the Smart City, I think is a face change for who gets to control the public space in a way and who gets to shape it. And I think that's like a profound change for governance. \n\nBecause right now, most of what we see, and this does not happen with any malign intentions, as far as I can tell, it's just like a thing, where the companies that make technology could connect public space or network companies, they are data analytics companies, they are logistics companies, companies that know how to track movement of physical things to physical space, and companies who know how to extract meaning from data. Those are the companies, the Ciscos and Googles - the waterways of the world. They know how to network stuff, and how to extract meaning, from the data that's created. And so with them, when they transfer the knowledge from advertising technology into the public space, or from global supply chain optimization into public space, they import along with them a certain logic of thinking about the space to us. And that is not necessarily compatible with what we know works for a rich life, or civic life in the city. And so that's the slightly heavy way to think about this. But really, the question is, who gets to control? what's allowed in the city? Is it the vendors of technology? Or is it the citizens who live there, and what we see in practice is that the vendors are lobbying city administration like crazy to just implement stuff, and then test it. But once it's implemented, realistically, it's never going to be taken back out. Again, once it's in there, it's established. \n\nAnd so we're in a really pivotal point right now where I think we can help shape the discourse of what we actually want to see in public space. And what we don't want to see there by establishing first participatory practices that say, Okay, if we're going to put something in public space, we're going to have a process where it's not just something where a vendor sells a city something without public oversight, or with not very meaningful public oversight. And then everybody's just stuck with it for like, 25 years in a IT support situation.\n\n**John** 5:24  \n\nYou make the comment, at one point in your writing, don't leave something this important to a bunch of tech Bros. You also made the point that technology is political.\n\n**Peter** 5:35  \n\nYes. And so as I think these lines are both very closely interrelated. I'm a political science and communication science major by background. So while I've never worked much in that field, I do think a lot about how things are political. And it always sounds like an abstract kind of late at night red wine discussion. But really only it means who has the right to change the rules, if we don't? Who gets to decide what's allowed? What's up? With whom? What's good for whom? How do we measure what's good, right? And silence these questions. There's never going to be a perfect answer. But the quest of finding an answer and discussing this is really important. \n\nWhen I refer to the bro culture, I mostly mean, that's really, a lot of the products we see out of Silicon Valley. These things are made by young fairly well-off men for their peers. There's nothing inherently bad about this. But this is not a representation of the world. This is a very narrow section of how we go through the world. There's gender issues, there's control issues. There's racial components to this. But there's also, just like a wealth gap issue, always part of this, a lot of smart cities stuff, for example, that's the secret. This is what's called pay for place. So of course, it's it sounds like a fair argument to say, Hey, if you're going to use the service, you should pay for it, that's fine. But on the other hand, there's a good reason we provide some stuff for free, because we don't want stuff to be exclusively available. If you're rich enough to afford it. There's some stuff, and sometimes it's more than others, but where we just think this is really important that this is what means civilization, and it goes the same for us. So this is going to be available for everybody. To a certain degree that starts with stuff like clean air, to some degree, it starts with affordable public transport. It is available in some countries. I come from Germany, I live in Germany, public health care, that's not free, but it's very affordable is one of those, Where does it start and an end. That's the thing that every society has to decide for themselves. But that everything should just work really, really well, for young single men who are 25 and get 250 grand a year, it should also work for like a young Hispanic mom, who has to get by on 30 grand a year and may have three kids, some things should not work for just fairly rich white guys.\n\n**Christian** 7:55  \n\nI, I think one of the main reasons why things go wrong or tend to go wrong is because usually the sensor package and the action package get put into one thing, the person or the organization, who does the monitoring of traffic is also the same organization that then controls the traffic. And because that data never gets used. Otherwise, the interesting part of what make smart cities or internet of things for the city is if we have on one side, little machines or little computers that generate data, and that show data to people and make it available publicly anonymized pro certain point or whatever. And when on the other side, we have services that use that data, and then provide services based on that. And as long as we keep this device intact, we have publicly available data sources. And then the option to use that data and then have paid services, free services, open source services, things made by enthusiasts and things made by new companies that do something, we can have all the good things there and we make even the bad things, but we can act on it, we will have the option to say okay, this company is doing bad things with data, we're not buying there anymore, or we as society decide to shut them down. But we still have the upside of being able to use the data. There's a friend of mine here in Berlin working on a project where they are basically adding very simple sensors to elevators with a long term goal of making all this sensor data on the elevators publicly available, and then have a disability-friendly map of buildings know that at the train station, the elevator is not working before you're there. So you can take the train to the next train station where there is a working elevator.\n\nAnd that works because there is this divide between our sensors delivering data, and the services we make use of. And if we do that, for traffic lights for traffic control for congestion, for smart air quality, noise levels, how many people are walking down the street right now? Is it full? Is it full of tourists or not all that and then allow people to make choices based on their data and you have apps or things working on that. That's a whole other thing.  \n\nI don't know how many of you read Wired magazine back in the 90s. There was always on the last few pages, the column by Nicholas Negroponte. In one of those, he painted a dystopian and utopian picture of the city. And on every corner possible, there was a surveillance camera, and all the cameras collecting all the data and all the images from everywhere. And in one city, all the data went to one entity, surveilling everything. And in the other city, that was just open video data. Anyone could at any point, go to any camera and look for it. There was no central authority on that. Anyone could look up, yep, I'm going to look to this camera right now, and could save the stream just in case or not. Which of these cities will be nicer? They are both surveillance states that the one has some sort of crowd control on it, where people can look at this and can get to the data, even if a police is doing something wrong. And that's where the power dynamic comes into play. And I think this is something that is really important for public internet of things, that the data that is being collected should be available to the public.\n\n**Peter** 11:47  \n\nThey're really important points. So thank you so much for sharing that. So first, you touched on, stopping to work with a company if they happen to abuse that data or if they're just not good enough, that's a really good point. Like currently, most Smart City contracts have these long built in contracts where it's IT infrastructure that you don't easily switch back and forth. And that's a question of procurement that's only solved at the stage of buying public infrastructure and defining terms of data portability, and that kind of stuff and exit strategies and making sure they\u2019re not too proprietary, there's a really big lock there. And even if you have to use some providers stuff, which sometimes might happen, I think there's still practices to make sure you can move to a different vendor. So that's absolutely important. \n\nYou touched on publicly available data, like open data, like strengthening the data comments, essentially, which I think is a tremendously powerful thing that we've only seen the tiniest first steps on. It feels like there's a lot happening. And there is but, I think if you look back in 10 years time, it will look like the tiny, tiny bit of the curve where it just goes up a little bit. And this little mountain that's like a big hockey stick curve. There is a downside to that too. Where going back to like what Negroponte wrote there, we all thought like that in the 90s. And up till maybe like fairly recently that publicly available data also means evenly distributed power dynamic. And only now do we find that if it's publicly available, it could also very easily be abused by much more capable organizations like the New York Times that have fantastic interactive piece, maybe maybe three months ago, maybe a little longer, where they tried to track individuals through like a cheap, I'm not sure if it was Microsoft or a Huawei Chinese tracking software like facial recognition software. And they just cooked it up with publicly available video feeds around Union Square over a week and tracked people that they could identify with a very high confidence, and they took their sample data. If I if I remember this correctly, I think they took the faces of the company websites around unit square, and then run it through the facial recognition software, and compare that to the video feeds. So there is an element where it's very easy to start being really invasive with this. And I'd have no solutions for this whatsoever. Maybe maybe just no video cameras whatsoever. Maybe that's maybe the radical kind of Luddite approach is like the only one that works. But I don't feel comfortable proposing that. It does have interesting friction there, right. TI think that maybe that's the best I have to offer. There's interesting trade offs there to make sure. But also, there's recently like a wave of new companies that actually also figured out better ways to do video recognition stuff in public space, but do it with a full respect of privacy where on device they filter out faces, or number of plates of cars, or where they track footfall in retail spaces, but only looking at the feet. And somehow, through gate recognition managed to get fairly robust demographic data for retail spaces by only ever looking at feet, which I would be kind of surprised that someone found a way to make that a horrible thing. Yeah, that seems like a very, very sensible approach, like if you can actually make that work. But there's a New York City based startup that collects traffic data like cyclists and cars in public space. And they automatically filter out all the faces and the number plates. And so you get traffic analysis. But like nothing ever leaves the device is all further up on device seems to me like a really powerful point of leverage, where you don't have to trust the company to have good Privacy Practices later on, if the stuff never gets collected to begin with. So that's not like criticism about the points. Like that's a that's a very clear Yes. And there's there's a really interesting part about the decentralization and the commons, kind of like leveling the playing field here that I don't think solves all the problems. But it certainly is a much better start than just having one company collect all that stuff and go crazy. \n\n**John** 15:49  \n\nIt maps directly right back to technology being political, because in order for that kind of benign vision to even be possible, it isn\u2019t enough to have a democratic society, you have to have more than just that. You have to have an aware society. \n\nIn your writing, you talk about your little privacy dial - a little thing in your home that dials up how much privacy you want at a given moment. You have another example, there's a kind of a fob you could carry around in public that would let you have some kind of control over your environment, which I thought was a wonderful idea. \n\n**Peter** 16:31  \n\nWell, I'm always hopeful. There was a small piece of speculative fiction as part of an exhibit for the DNA Museum in London, where they explore the impact of tech on society. And we just played around with known interfaces trying to have them do stuff to give you control of your data. And these are complete purely visual mockups, the box to do anything but latest LEDs and the favelas, literally some some piece of metal and a kitchen and some some Sugru or something. But the idea was that just like we know how to turn on and off, up or down the volume on an old hi fi system, you could just say, hey, all my smartphone devices go through this thing. And when I want my home to be as assistive as possible in the mornings when I have to get ready for work, and maybe have kids running around or whatever, I want all the efficiency that they can offer me. And so as I say, you know, I'm going to wind down the privacy part, but I'm going to let it do all its smart and loose and support stuff that it could possibly do. Whereas, in the evenings, I might sit down with my partner and just want to want to have like a quiet conversation and might not need that level of assistance, I'm going to turn the privacy all the way up. And I won't need all the smart stuff, I'm just going to have my privacy now. And in a very intuitive interface. This model, of course, breaks down really fast when you like try to map what it actually means in context. So it's really like it's a speculative fiction piece. And a fairly simple one at that. \n\nYou all know the feeling when you're invited to a friend's birthday or something. And in my my peer group, my circle of friends, there's like a bunch of people who really like Internet tech, but also are others who are real hardcore privacy activists. And so you'll always have like a bit of this tension, which is maybe too much of a word. But, clearly, there's there's different interests coming into the room where some people want to share with you on Instagram, and others don't want their photos to be taken at all. Preferably some check in on Foursquare others would rather have you know, like a Wi Fi blocker, but whatever the range might be. And the idea with this fob thing was that, what if we just have a thing on a key chain where we kind of set a default, where we define what, generally speaking, I want in public spaces such as, I don't mind my movement to be recorded, but I don't want my face to be seen in public and in private space at home I don\u2019t want anything being recorded, when I go to like someone, I don't go through three to three degrees of separation, I might only be comfortable having either recorded or presence recorded, but not audio, whatever the things may be the match your personal preferences, as you could just have them set. And when you walk into a room, the room would be smart enough to recognize and also respect all that these wishes and fulfill them. Of course, like I said, that would mean first of all, that all the infrastructure is in place, which of course, it's not. That every vendor, every app maker every hacker like agrees to these rules and respects them, which of course is like a wish we would live in that society. And also, we all need to agree that that's actually even something desirable. And that needs to be respected. And of course, that's like the next thing. We need to be able to trust the whole chain to respect that decision, and to work. And of course, this is never going to happen, right? This is like, when we talk to these people who are not technologists at the VNA in London, it was really interesting, because people got the idea. The moment you mentioned, both of these, they're like, Oh, yeah, I can set my stuff here. And then I can just walk in and the place knows what's cool. Like, that makes sense to me. I want to dial up and privacy down. First, there was like a bit of a question around like what a smartphone even does but then, and they're like, Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I want that. Can I get that? And of course, the answer is no, absolutely not. The moment you have, the microphone, you kind of got a hope at Amazon. And all the makers of apps on the on the Amazon Echo are trustworthy enough to respect your choices. Maybe they are, I hope they are.\n\n**John** 20:30\n\nSo you have a smart city. And you set it up where maybe it doesn't quite go all the way. But let's say part of the way toward this, and no doubt the people of Toronto, people in government of Toronto, I mean, I wasn't sitting in on the pitches, but I've been to plenty of pitches to government and high up people who don't really use this stuff or completely understand it and you dazzle them properly. They'll say, Oh, yeah, okay, we want this, that sounds really benign and cool. And we'll get that going and won't be exactly the way you describe a better vision, but it'll kind of work. And the people running Toronto, you know, are pretty good people, I think in their hearts and stuff. However, all you gotta do is get some people in who don't feel that way, who flip a few switches. And suddenly, you have a pretty dystopian situation, like I see in China. I saw 911, here in America in 2001 change our society very profoundly. Everybody was all freaked out. And in the end, during all that panic, all kinds of horrible laws got passed, at least horrible in my opinion, to essentially surveil us all in order to make us feel more safe. And so then you get Obama, a guy who has a strong belief in certain amount of civil liberty and personal control, who understands the technology and did have to engage with the national security state. And I can only imagine what that must have felt like, I'm not going to second guess the man's political instincts. But you know, he dialed it back a little bit, but that structure was largely already in place. Okay, now we have Donald Trump, he and his people are completely comfortable with mass ignorance and a high level of surveillance. And he has millions of supporters who are perfectly fine with that. I'm reiterating the point that whether you like it or not, technology really is political.\n\n**Peter** 22:47  \n\nWhen it really touches the most personal parts of a man just like this, with a strong power dynamic, which, of course is government to citizen relations. There's always a point that I'm making - it mostly doesn't play the day to day the way it should - that the citizens rule through the government, but rather there is a slight disconnect often where governments can come into power. And they might totally use all the established infrastructure and the data you collect for not the originally intended purposes. Often for nefarious purposes. Like I said, I'm German, I studied German history, there's like two states in like the last less than 100 years, that essentially run to a large degree on large scale data collection, spying on citizens and absolute abuse of power at the expense of a lot of large minorities, mostly, and often leading to horrible, horrible, horrible results, first the Nazi regime, of course. And then also, isn't Germany also like a big surveillance states compared to today's level of surveillance? Of course, this looks like peanuts, but it ran very efficiently, right. And so these are things where oftentimes we see infrastructure implemented with good intentions. But every technology that can be used for bad will be used for bad at some point. So when you talk to security and privacy activists, of course, they will say, the only really powerful failsafe way of data protection and privacy protection is by not collecting any data at all - is data avoidance. Once you install CCTV cameras in public space, it's a question of time. First they are going to use it to remove some trash then to highlight some bad parking along the way, of course, always like to find like terrorists, if you can, often they don't turn up anything. And so there's a question of time, because at some point, they need to justify all these costs for very low level returns. And so you're going to widen the mandate for the surveillance.\n\n**Inge** 24:40  \n\nI want to go a little bit back. There were a few things mentioned about this before. And I have to say the reason why this is so important to me is because I work with journalists who are covering these stories, mainly about the problem with smart cities, for example, in China, where a minority is being currently genocide. And the problems with smart cities. I've posted this on the on the forum before as well, a newsletter actually by a by a colleague of mine about his ideal Smart City was always negative because he focused so much on authoritarian regimes using it in a bad way. And he got all these Google alerts about how great Smart Cities are. I think this competition is great to have and needed to have for for us in the West and in the states and hopefully able to push a more ethical and sensible way of using tech. But what can be done about regime said, like you were mentioning right now, Germany itself 100 years ago, and then 50 years ago, use the surveillance state and negative way to suppress people? How should we approach this? And what can be done? I mean, there are companies that are willingly selling their surveillance tech to make smart cities in China. Is there something - what is our role in making sure that can't happen? In your opinion, what should be done?\n\n**Christian** 26:06  \n\nI am at the same time, incredibly optimistic and pessimistic. Let's start with the pessimistic part. The cat is out of the bag, the genie is out of a bottle, we will not be able to go back. But technology is VR. But technology is getting better and better and scarier and scarier, mass surveillance, will be effect, we will not be able to get rid of it with technology, because whenever we built the technology that enhances privacy, someone will build a technology that negates that enhancement, and then as more researchers are coming up with more and more ways to identify people, how they look different biometric things like skin, fingerprints, mouth prints, whatever it's getting more and more and more and more. And we probably haven't even scratched the surface yet on how to identify humans with technology. And that's getting more and more, we will have data collection, it's getting easier and easier. If someone wants to spy on us at large scale, they will be able to do so. The only thing that has a chance in hell of stopping that is the social contract. That's the only chance we have. And that's where I'm going to be optimistic. I don't know when we will achieve that. But ideally, I hope and believe that at some point, we will come to terms as humanity as a whole in how we integrate living with this technology. I don't have any idea of how that is going to look. But we have to realize that the concept of privacy we are living in right now, as in, we have separate bedrooms, we will not have sex in front of our children. This is new compared to the whole story of humanity. And not saying this is bad. This is good. But we're having this right now. But a lot of the concepts of what is private and what is not is a social construct that we have arrived at sometimes recently.  \n\nScandinavia, for example, especially Sweden, has a lot different expectations on how you treat your salary. In Germany talking about your salary is kind of a taboo among colleagues, you don't tell your colleagues what you're making or, allowed to buy contracts - you're not even allowed. In Sweden, for contrast, you can look up anyone's salary on a public internet database. If you know the name of a person in Sweden, you can look up what they make per year. That's a completely different concept. And both have sort of advantages and disadvantages. I\u2019m leaning towards the Sweden model myself, but but on the other hand, I'm German I grew up here. And this you don't - the don't talk about money thing is kind of ingrained in me and we will have to come come to terms with effect. But anyone can find out everything about us online, eventually. And that will have a huge impact on how we will live and how we will treat each other. And in the best possible of roles. This will mean that we will be able to accept each other more that we will be able to forgive things, though not necessarily forget. But actually forgive. Right now we have this \u2018you rights to be forgotten\u2019 directive, where if Google know something about your past, which you're embarrassed about, you can tell Google to not show it in the search result, you have an actual legal rights of that. The next evolutionary step would be that, yes, I have something horrible in my past, but I have overcome it. And even though you know it, you will not hold it against me, because now I'm a different person than 5-10 years ago. I have no idea how we will get there. That is basically the only chance we have as a species. To overcome this, we will have to adapt to living with very invasive technology. And we will have to adapt in a way hopefully, that will make us better, as opposed to just controlling each other and use it as a means of oppression, then we have to protect privacy by social norms.\n\n**Peter** 30:25  \n\nThere's a bunch of things like wrapped up there, right? Because, Yes, I think part of it is social norms. Now, we need to have the social norms, and then some hard guaranteed rights, I don't know, if if the UN Human Rights have been set as the baseline or something or something new that comes out of them or something else entirely. But there is a hard thing that you can go to court to, hopefully, if your country supports the rule of law. And then there's the social norm kind of that's like on the smaller change level, not the faster change, before it gets put into law. \n\nSo there's one thing that I think you mentioned, also, your colleague or friend worked a lot with the horrible implementations of smart cities, and in authoritarian regimes, but now he gets all these Google alerts for the great versions. And I think what one question that I personally find really helpful to just ask when you see something like this is working well or not? Well, this is great. Great for whom? And by extension, for whom is it maybe not great? Is it only great for the 25 year old white dudes? Or is it great for the week? Or is it in China as well? And that's where I think you often get two interesting branches off the discussion. And so how can we make this stuff better, of course. I have opinions of what I'd like to see down there. I'd like to see a stronger focus on privacy and other stuff. But I think more importantly, then, what I think should happen is that we have a process in place. And that's where the policy part comes in. A process in place that is participatory, and actually democratic. That makes sure that I'm not the person deciding this because I'm one person and I'm in a historically very dominant, very privileged demographic group, I should not be deciding these things. So I think that's where that participation part is a really important one. We're in smart cities, I don't think we see it as much as say on the local governance.\n\n**Inge** 32:18  \n\nI think the question that needs to be answered in general is, can we make it more inclusive? There\u2019s this Wired video about the problems with AI and facial recognition and how it's super biased and how this is a problem for minorities and gender, gender minorities and ethnic minorities because that they are so much more likely to be miss-recognized, and so they have much more chances of, for example, being questioned by the police or seen as a perpetrator even though they're not. In this video, I think towards the end, it says, the only way to change is if we change the demographics of the AI study group, because it's white males. I don't know the percentage, but it was like 10% is like female and so. So that brings us to a second, I think, question when it comes to ethics and Internet of Things is how do we increase this inclusivity? And how can we make sure that we include all kinds of different groups?\n\n**John** 33:35  \n\nThis European Commission project, Next Generation Internet, Internet of Humans is related to the document you participated in, the Vision for a Shared Digital Europe that I don't think it has a formal relationship with this NGO project. Or maybe it does, I don't really know. But it's very similar in what it's going for in describing how society ought to work or it could work. And it has these pillars: cultivate the commons, decentralize infrastructure, enable self determination, and empower public institutions. And then it also call for replacing what it calls \u201cthe lens of markets\u201d with these four pillars. But that, to me suggests that capitalism itself as it is currently practice would actually have to change in order for such a thing to come about. Do you agree?\n\n**Peter** 34:31  \n\nI cannot take a lot of credit for it. I love the project. It doesn't have any formal relationships, I think, to anyone but the three lead authors and a few people who, like me gave some input, because it's literally at this point, just a large document online, by activists from you know, the Netherlands and from Poland and a few really esteemed senior colleagues from working with them for a long time who come from an Open Data background and activist governance background. And you're right, that's a big challenge that they're proposing. They're not just that Europe shifts away from seeing everything digital, just as a market, which currently, it does, where all the development stuff is framed as under the banner of the digital single market. And in the European Union, it was like this tiny term in some obscure document that at some point, just slowly started spreading until it became like the lead framing for the policy, the lens that everything to do with the internet is looked at and funded as is all market market market. And they say, hey, that's not bad. But it's also really myopic. It should only be a narrow part of what happens online, the internet is much more than just a marketplace. It's also the commons. It's everyday conversations. It's the tool that empowers this and empowers all the communities essentially, they say, how about the just start advocating for reframing of the internet, within the structure of the European Union, not primarily a market, but primarily a commons, decentralized infrastructure, and powered citizens, and empowered public institutions, the market is still a thing there. But it's a much, much reduced thing. It's not the thing that everything works for, it's the market would work for these other four pillars. And that's a very powerful framing, that I really, really hope, just like this single market, that as a term started spreading from this obscure document across the whole of the European Commission's language, that this may just do a similar thing where it, starts spreading from document to document and at some point, it's what shapes the thinking. And hence, also all the funding the European Union puts to work, which of course is a lot. That's how the European Union makes change happens through some laws and through some funding, right. That's the main mechanisms of influencing change.\n\n**John** 36:56  \n\nYou mentioned that you see opportunities here for European companies. And I think that is part of what the commission is looking for with this project, which is why they call it NGI Forward. Because we're all pretty good at describing the problems. And we're pretty good at describing what we want. And the trouble is, as futurist Paul Saffo once said, Never mistake a clear vision for a short path. But I think the opportunity here is to build products that are embedded with these values in what I guess is the hope that people will prefer them.\n\n**Peter** 37:36  \n\nif you look five years ago, there are many reasons why Silicon Valley technology is credibly dominant and solid. So for a long time, it's just been far superior to many other places, or better marketed, whatever the success factors were, but also in the current global way. W on the global market, think about data and how we extract meaning and value from data. They're at a clear advantage because they're much more free to do with their data as they please, as opposed to European companies that have traditionally been through a different kind of data protection laws. And they're maybe not more free and using this data. Then Chinese companies have easier access to the Western world. That's five years ago, right. So fast forward to 2019, we see I think, a dramatically changed global landscape. Because first of all, Chinese companies have gotten so much better at working across the global West and global south, they're much more international and global in their scope, and ambition. So that's one part. Silicon Valley companies, for the first time face significant pushback across all of the world for various different reasons in China because of geopolitics in Europe, because of geopolitics, and privacy violations and data breaches in the States, because they're kind of providing the tools for an election meddling, and all that stuff. So there's a complex mishmash of weirdness going on. But I think it's also very clear that since the GDPR came into effect that comes with significant financial, global fines for certain uses and abuses of data, and all of a sudden, you, you see a much more level playing field for companies that are from Europe, and stick to the national European data protection regulation. And they are not at a disadvantage, because they can't use the data as efficiently. But rather, they just happen to be compliant with one of the most powerful legal blocks in the world, whereas the others may get fined if they follow their own procedures. I have strong opinions on it. And yes data protection, but I also am painfully aware that part of this is like a horrible geopolitical power play in a way that feels really unhealthy To me, it's like, oh, we're also going to leverage local industry at the expense of the others. But to me also, I think, as long as it's based on certain rights I believe in and values I believe in, I'm kind of okay with it, if that makes sense. \n\nMaybe I shouldn't be. But I really am. I really like data protection to be stronger until we figure out what we want to get out of this. And for the first time, in probably 20 years, European companies are on equal footing in that space, the global players, and one example that I really, really like, it's a fairly small startup out of friends. They're called snip stuff dot AI. And they're like a voice assistant, and voice assistance are, you know, like, the Google Home or I'm an Echo, but their version is fully open source. And it comes with a pre-trained data set. It doesn't share anything back to the company. And for them, it was like a security privacy decision. But by the time the GDPR got implemented, when all the other companies started scrambling, and my phone stopped ringing, because then we were just trying to figure out, how can we make our data-hungry services compliant with that, which, frankly, I didn't have an answer, I could say, you probably can, but for them it's, it's by design, and it's by designed data for that particular law. They were having a big party, because all of a sudden, they get validation, they get a political framework, a policy framework that said, hey, what you're doing is exactly what we want. So you will not have to fear anything, you're good to go. And it gives them a boost. And they were one of these companies that already were trying to do the right thing by their users. And all of a sudden, they got a leg up from the European government in a way that I find really interesting, because of course, all these companies not like an unusual move for every country has policies in place to boost their economies and to boost certain technologies of others and certain markets or others. It's just for the first time that I've seen the European Commission, actually, up in the Parliament get serious and kind of intentional about that, and not just defensive in a way that I found really interesting. I just want to say, yes, I think there is a powerful point of leverage to boost certain values and certain rights on the global stage and incentivize companies to build products based on these values.\n\n**John** 42:03  \n\nOne of your big projects, and your Mozilla Fellowship was about your Trust Level tech certification process. For those who don't know, you can go to trusttech.org, where you can apply to get certified answering a long string of questions.  \n\nAnd even if you don't want to get certified, the questionnaire is so all encompassing, that it's a good map of the landscape. But I found it useful simply to read it. My question now is along the lines of what we were just talking about: have you seen any interest in the Commission or the larger pan-European government in this kind of a certification process, which would be different than Oh, you broke the law? And now we're going to find you, you know, I mean, it would be a kind of a positive step. Are they interested in that?\n\n**Peter** 42:55  \n\nYes, we designed this question specifically to look at all the aspects of product development which is really what we've been building for a long time, slower than I hoped we would. But we've been building for a long time, an actual design guideline. So by the end, you\u2019re just like automatically there. You don't have to, answer these questions, in hindsight, but these are all questions that aim at how you handle data, how you handle security, how you handle these kind of things in a pretty holistic manner. These are all questions you have to answer one way or another during design process anyway, only some companies I think, don't make it explicit. They just build something. And they've made a decision, but maybe they weren't even aware they're making this decision. So yes, it is like this, just for legal reasons. It's not a certification, because I learned this along the way, certification actually, in the German context at least, is a check if you're compliant with the law. And we , like you indicated, did not want to just say, Are you compliant with the law? We want to say, Are you building products and really respect users privacy and users rights? And do you empower users and give them all the rights you can, or strip them of the rights because you legally can. We wanted to say we didn't want to have the baseline certification of \u201cthis is not a horrible product\u201d, we wanted to find and identify and give some external validation and and reach to those products that go above and beyond in respecting user privacy and user rights.  \n\nHave we seen much interest in this? More from the policy side and product side, because it's hard to go back and have Twitter or go to a product that you launched, while you're working on the next level of the next product release cycle, it's hard to go back and then try to map that on your existing products. I hope you'll see interest in the next year, when more companies come out that have been developed based on this, there has been huge interest in the Smart City space to see what of this thinking can be applied to Smart City space, and to other decision making in the public space. I haven't seen that much feedback from the European Commission. To be honest, I've been involved in a lot of products where I'm on all these panels in Brussels. I\u2019m in the right conversations now. Nobody has invited us to see if we can apply this directly in a larger scale on the European level. And that'd be really interesting conversation to have. I'm not sure if that's possible. But I'm sure that our research surfaces enough potential issues and enough possible solutions to make sure that a lot of stuff would get a lot better, certainly a lot more respectful of your rights as a citizen and as a user.\n\n**John** 45:35  \n\nChristian is actively building a product that, as far as I know, very likely would qualify for that certification, which he's building from scratch, or sort of from scratch. Rather than \u201cwe have to basically bug fix our product to comply with something\u201d it starts from the premise that, as Christian put it on the Edgeryders site, social media is broken. \n\nLet's fix it, though, the only way to do that is to make things where the fix is in the core of it; you can't just put a nice suit of clothes on it. A lot of why this stuff comes up is related to social media. Things started to change extremely rapidly when you get smartphones widely adopted. This field of social media has overwhelmed so many things. The point I want to make about that is I see it a little bit related to the climate problem in the sense that there are tangible short term benefits, and the long term problems are not so tangible - until they show up.\n\n**Christian** 46:47  \n\nthe whole GDPR thing that is a perfect example of the social contract at work. And when I said only social contract can rescue us from the horrible internet, GDPR is one of those things in there. Something that is often overlooked is infrastructure. And the internet is infrastructure, social media, up to a point is infrastructure. Infrastructure drives civilization in the most profound ways. I don't know if any of you read David Prince\u2019s book, the Postman, you probably have all watched the movie with Kevin Costner. But basically, it's the story of civilization being restarted through the use of infrastructure, because suddenly there starts to be infrastructure, again, infrastructure for communication. And that bootstraps the whole civilization, again, that puts people in touch with each other, make them realize their very community. And that is what the internet is doing on a much larger scale. And that's the hopeful thing about it. Where we can use that. And if we protect it and see it as that sort of infrastructure, we can really drive forward. And if we build this infrastructure and maintain it with a view to protect minorities, to look at not the voices of those who are white and powerful, but everyone else, and build it in a way that respects everyone's voice, then we can build a truly internet of humans.\n\n**John** 48:36  \n\nWe've got the policy issues, we know the problems, or at least some of them, what concretely are we really doing about it, and I'll bring the Chinese back into the picture here because you pointed out when you went to Shenzhen, the Silicon Valley of hardware, at one point you show a fairly simple, but nice looking little smart lamp. Not really that outstanding, except the thing was made by a class of fifth graders.  \n\n**Peter** 49:20  \n\nShenzhen is fantastic, an impressive powerhouse in in the way they make technology, this is where essentially, all the factories and all the supply chains globally go from the silica mines in Africa, to the container shipping and packaging that ships this stuff's going on your end to Africa into Southeast Asia. And to a billion people in China. A giant chunk of that stuff is often produced in different versions for like differently priced markets. So hover boards are cheaper in the Philippines, which is why someone who imported the less secure cheaper version to the UK, they started catching fire. There's this aspect where they are the production line essentially for the whole world for electronics, but increasingly also developing and researching new technologies at ever greater speed. And it's a very intentional thing - a big government project. I think it's everything to do with IoT, with making connected stuff there. It has the term Internet Plus, where they just say \u201cwe want to be a world leader in AI in electronics and connected devices.\u201d And then they add the resources to it. Not having a strong democratic mechanism behind it, of course, makes it easier to have decentralized efforts, all the drawbacks that brings with it all the horrible drawbacks. But that's why it's possible to say we want to be world leaders. So we're just going to commit x billion a year to train X, Y, or Z number of PhDs in AI research, they're going to be trained by some of the best professors to China and software which are really smart there and developed training, they're also, certainly several hundred thousand or however many maybe study abroad at the most, prestigious universities, the nationally is really impressive. \n\nAnd like you said that small example when we went to this small maker space as a change of pace, essentially to see not just the factories and the r&amp;d departments, but also see the community spaces. We saw the smart lamp looked like a perfectly fine smart lamp. I thought, that looks like something Phillips, might produce or you know, it's it's a fine consumer product. It's really uninspired and boring, has motion detection, it regulates up or down \u2014 until the nine year old showed up who had made it. And I was like, Whoa, okay, that's kind of mind blowing. To me. It's also a generational thing that totally has gotten better and all of this, but still, it's impressive. They had found 3D models, they've modified them then from code, they modified it, they plugged it all together. Is this groundbreaking r&amp;d? No, but when I was like that age, I'm not sure what I did. But it was certainly not designing smart lamps.\n\n**Inge** 52:22  \n\nAt a teenagers security surveillance fair in London a month or so ago, a few of the major setups there were actually Chinese companies. So one of the major surveillance companies has all these cameras, and they're insanely good surveillance cameras that are all over China, but they're also sending internationally to smart cities. And some other innovative companies, tech companies from China that are from before would produce, tech that was like sort of a copy of Silicon Valley. But right now they're getting to the stage where they are making actually better things that are still cheaper. And one example is my phone, I have a Xiaomi, quite popular right now with the four among us. This is like a $100 Phone. It's a smartphone, and it's insanely good. It's super high quality. And obviously, one of the questions is, again, with me focusing a lot with my work on how I started during regimes that use tech to suppress their populations. That's one of the things we focus on iwith one of the kinds of the people I work with. How do we make sure that the tech that we employ will make our lives better? On one hand I'd like the GDPR conversation we just had to happen in China, but we don't have that. So what can we use?\n\n**Peter** 54:06  \n\nI don't think I have any answers to this. And China has this like big, big public funding initiative called the \u2018belt road initiative,\u2019 where they essentially try to like recreate or take the model of the Silk Road into 21st century. It's a thing in Chinese politics to always have these cultural references and have a good name for this stuff. So this is the New Silk Road essentially, is the metaphor they work with. And what it means is a big chain of investments in in countries around the globe and public infrastructure and companies, lots of joint ventures, lots of research partnerships, a enormous scale, I think disproportionately in the global south like Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, but also in Europe and North America, Germany, there's, I think I recently saw a map for journalists had collected all these investments. Germany has, 10 or so and they're like, you know, here's a pilot project on Smart Lighting in a city. Here's a research partnership with the University, it all sounds pretty harmless and benign. And I really, really try to not be overly biased and be very careful in my language. But there is an aspect of this where you see big Chinese part of these investments, usually big Chinese tech companies like Huawei and the others and Tencent investing in local infrastructure and networks and communication networks. And it's tricky if you have a government for a legal regime where there is no hard firewall between these companies and the nondemocratic authoritarian regime. That's, highly, highly problematic if you rely on that with infrastructure, with sensors with data analytics. I'm a little hesitant because again, to me, there are weird colonialist undertones there, but it does feel really wrong to just, say, look, can we really allow this or not? In Africa, for example, we see a lot of Chinese companies going in and actually building amazing things for, you know, urban, rural farmers and rural life, there's a bunch of what seems to be benign, good stuff happening there at the speed of the markets that European and American companies will just completely ignore because it's not high margin. On the other hand, we also see giants of infrastructure being put in place. Lagos is one of the Smart City projects for YY. But I imagine all the fast growing like African cities will be at some point, \u201care you okay with that trade off of like getting like quick Wi Fi everywhere in exchange for massive surveillance?\u201d Or is this like a false choice that nobody should have to make? To me, it feels like, this shouldn't be the choice. But as long as I don't see a better alternative. I'm not sure what to say. It's easy for me to say the pure right thing is better than the compromise thing. But that's easy to say, if you have fast internet.\n\n**Christian** 56:59  \n\nI'm by no means an expert on China. But one thing that I want to give as fruitful for China is undoubtedly cracking down internally as if you're in China, and if you try to be in the opposition or being a dissident, or doing something that is not officially approved, you will live dangerously, and you will have a hard time and it is horrible. And we should work against that. The other thing though, is if for example, China invests in Africa, or generally in the global self, it must not be necessarily a nefarious motive. Because right now, China is gearing up to be a technology provider. Everything China exports and bets that they can export with the good margin, a good profit margin is electronics. Right now, Africa is a huge untapped market for that stuff. If they bring internet to Africa, if they bring technology development fear, they can't they create the market to sell more stuff. And that is probably a large reason why they are doing it. Instead of just \u201cwe want to export oppression and correct on software, and spy on people.\u201d\n\n**Inge** 58:16  \n\nI agree with you. And I think what Peter said as well, you know, this, this post-colonial context. Look at us, actually, the people on this call are all nice by Western European and USA. It's a difficult subject matter to discuss. But yes, you are right, or I agree with you to that extent. But there definitely some ways and this is not only China. Especially Africa is very, very vulnerable to being used as a test case or two. As facial recognition, there's is actually just this major scandal that was in Kenya with this French company, de mi Gemma, if I didn't know if I pronounce this correctly, that works with the Kenya government initially, to better their voter database to make a FIFO metric voter database, but their data was sold in the back markets. And so there was this big scandal and then the Kenyan government said, like, Oh, you cannot operate here anymore. But one of the reasons they actually did go to Kenya was because they could test the Kenyan government allowing them to test their technology and gave them a free space to do it, because the African governments are really hungry to to improve. And so if they're given visibility to technologically try out new things and are more eager to do it, and a lot of other countries besides France or China would, because of their already disadvantaged position. But they, you know, there was this other big scandal, and I don't know where it was, I don't think it was Kenya, where he said area where they work with Chinese companies to make these smart cities and all the facial recognition data is being sent back to China for their databases. The point is that these people, the people that are participating in this, don't realize that.  \n\nAnd again, we've come to the social contract, right? You don't realize that their own personal data is being given to a foreign government, which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. But because there are already countries that are at a certain disadvantage, they're more eager and willing and open to accept certain things without further thought, or, understanding of what the consequences might be, especially for their population. So I do think this isn't this is an important thing. And again, it's not just China, it's it's like I said, this French company, as well, that the global sales in general is more more vulnerable to this than we are.\n\n**Peter** 1:00:50  \n\nI couldn't agree more. These are, really important points. Yes, there's more need and more hunger to, to not turn opportunities down, just because they have a risk attached to them. I think when we talk to government officials, especially on the city level, like in Europe and the US where they're not necessarily in the same situation of need, but they're seeing, they have such a perception that they need to be seen as innovation friendly, that they also don\u2019t want to turn stuff down just because it would seem as anti-tech, anti-innovation. And they're facing a lot of trouble. And it's not like the smaller cities have like a big staff that has the capacity to analyze these impacts, really like a new big city does. And maybe San Francisco does. But Austin maybe already doesn't. And Austin is like a fairly big pro-Tech City. And so that's interesting, but also what what John raised at the beginning of the call, if this stuff gets shared back to a government that might possibly abuse it, that's already bad enough by many counts, where, for example, like Geneva Conventions do not just forbid torture, they're also forbid the threat of torture, because even if you don't torture, if you expect that you might be tortured, that already changes your behavior. Not that it's the same thing. But the same dynamic applies, I think, where if you know it could be abused and shared back it already has an impact on your life. The bizarre thing of all of this is, that maybe some of these data sets are much more diverse than those of the restaurant companies, which is partially why the New York City Police is trial trailing out the facial recognition software by a Chinese company, that's much better at recognizing darker skin faces. I don't have a strong point here, except that there's a lot of like weird things going on when we discuss these things, because it touches all parts of all our lives.\n\n**John** 1:02:55  \n\nI was reading in some of your material, where you were talking about neural networks, and how AI comes into play in all of this, because they're so profoundly different in the way that they go about gathering and out putting whatever their result is. And the point was made that neural network can output a result and you don't know how it got there. You may or may not know, even the people who made it don't always know how they got there.  \n\nYou showed this little video of all these little robots in a warehouse, doing a much more efficient better job of putting stuff where it belongs, and how that's gonna be the way it goes. And for that kind of thing, it\u2019s \u201cwell, I'm sorry, you don't have your job driving a forklift truck now, because robots are doing it.\u201d And that's one kind of too bad. \n\nBut what about when you get this kind of black box activity going on in a situation where you need to find out how you got there. That was why I was thinking of elections when I read that. How did we get here? I was thinking about the intersection of IoT and AI. Do you guys have any comments about that? How things move from IoT, which is reasonably understandable at least to me, with little sensors doing things feeding information to some central unit? It's not really that black of a box, if you want to look into it, but it is different when you're talking about people who make these things who don't even know how they got to the answer.\n\n**Peter** 1:04:30  \n\nright, and what went into like, shaping things\u2019 decisions, right? There's these things start as a thing where you test them for some results, and they show good results. And so, you know what, it's good enough. But you'd have a human in the loop. And at some point, the human in the loop seems to not add a lot of value. And so you cancel that line item in the budget. And all of a sudden, you don't have a level of recourse or someone to understand how these things happen. And we see this in a certain level of transparency in the way that insurance premiums are calculated. We see it to some degree in the way that policing algorithms work. Most of these stories are fairly horrible. I guess we only read about the ones that are fairly horrible. But if you can really interrogate the way that decisions are made, if you don't, we don't need to know all the the exact. The exact recipe is one metaphor, everyone's heard that I kind of like, we do need to know which ingredients go into the decision making. So we can at least get to some level of accountability. We don't need to necessarily understand exactly how it works. But we need to have tools built in and methods to interrogate if the results are correct, we need to if we are using AI to do any decision of importance, and we make it mandatory to use AI for that.\n\n**Christian** 1:05:54  \n\nIf the person who gets potentially affected cannot opt out of the AI, then I need to be able to understand the process in all of its forgiveness. Because if I'm not able to understand that this is a nightmare scenario, and it's really important that AI only gets implemented in ways where people can look after this. Part of the reason why Germany is still so much on the paper votes is that is something that every person with a minimal amount of training can actually understand how the votes are being counted. If there is a machine, then you will suddenly need special knowledge and special training to understand what is happening and to be able to check on it. And that's the same thing with AI systems. If an AI system that makes a decision, I need to be able to understand how video a vi system came to the decision. So in order to make a meaningful appeal to it, if it's necessary, or to understand one of my behavior or my things or my surroundings, factor into that decision. If that doesn't happen, it\u2019s basically the same as if the king just say kill that person. And I just have to deal with that. That's the same result from the citizens perspective. And that really means AI must be made in a way that is transparent. Also to uncover any hidden bias that is created in the AI when it's being built, where we end up with systems that don't see black people.\n\n**Peter** 1:07:33  \n\nI think that is a really good point. I think in the meantime, we just need to also make sure that there is a level of a method for records built in. This is something that's an aspirational goal, but I'm not sure it can ever be fully reached. But in the meantime, which might be forever, we just need to make sure that if something smells fishy or something goes wrong, there is a method to address that and get someone to look into it, preferably a human. I know Institute's annual report, they have all these examples of say, you know, health insurance in the States, changing the rules for like, who gets what level of care at home with like certain disabilities, and how the rules change. And all of a sudden someone gets lowered from getting like a full-time care person to a 20% care person, which might not be enough to get through your day, in a dignified way. And if there's nobody to understand how the process ends up there, then you in deep trouble because you have no level of recourse that says something that happens because this is always like a force not applied in a vacuum. But it's applied in like horrible, commercialized, cost saving contexts where all the safeguards will be stripped off to make to increase the profit margin. And that's where things go really wrong.\n\n**Christian** 1:09:02  \n\nIt's even worse, the thing is VIP process costs time. And depending on who or where you are, in which circumstances you are, for example, you get a parking ticket, you could just pay it and when it's when it's over. Or you could say I don't want to pay, I handed it over to my lawyer. That implies that you have a lawyer and you're willing to take the risk. But if it's somebody for whom it is going to cost more with that lawyer, that implies a whole different level of wealth so they just pay for the parking ticket, because the risk of having that escalate into something bad, right? They won't do. Now imagine VA is handing off the parking ticket because it's an AI, it's a computer thing, it's suddenly at a much larger scale. That's the thing with everything where humans are involved, that puts a limit on how often this happens. Because that takes time. And if you want to scale it up, you need some way more humans for this. So it's not happening at that large scale. If it's a computer, you can have it 1000 times per second, and it doesn't cost you much more. So suddenly, VAI would give our parking tickets way more often. And then, to stay in this example, which is slowly getting more unlikely you would have poor people bombarded with target parking tickets, they cannot fight having VAIV, and just saying \u201cin case you do not like for result Call this number\u201d is not enough.\n\n**Peter** 1:10:34  \n\nAgain, we need like a fair playing field for all artists. We need transparency and all that. I think it's not a coincidence that s one of the organizations that is most urgently researching transparent AI is DARPA and the US military research agency, because they say look, we do need algorithmic assistance in the way we handle our weapons systems. But we also really need to understand how exactly they come to their conclusions. For example, an AI- based visual recognition of incoming fighter planes is much faster and more reliable than human eyes at a certain distance. Because you can't even see, you can resolve what's going on, when they already recognize the movement patterns as drones or rockets or planes. But before you shoot at anything you need to really know that you are shooting at the right thing. And you can cue all the examples of where that went wrong with like human or no human in the loop. Of course, there's more than enough examples of that. But I was at a conference listening to a military person, at a fairly high ranking University, describing in great detail how they're super afraid of introducing too much AI into the process, because the risk of escalation and wrong decisions is so high if you just go to the point where you say a green light or red light for shoot inga gun shows that you really need to know is this reliable or not. And CN system always having a human and never have fully automated systems on that level, which gives me a shred of hope at least.\n\n**John** 1:12:08  \n\nEither you or somebody you were quoting was describing how in chess, the computer beats the human but when a computer and a human team up, they always beat the computer by itself.\n\n**Peter** 1:12:22  \n\nYes, like the Center Chess model. That goes back to the Engelbart focus on augmentation over automation. I think that's where it gets really interesting: when you don't just replace humans by automating them away. But you give them superpowers, the way that all of technology does, it\u2019s like going back to a knife where the knife helps us to cut things that we couldn't slice them with our hands, these tools enhance our capabilities. And that's I think, where things get really interesting and where I'd like to see things going where we augments the skills of of humans rather than automate them away.\n\n**John** 1:13:00  \n\nThank you so much, Peter. It is an honor to have you with us. Christian, the same with you. And always a pleasure, Inge.\n\n**Peter** 1:13:10  \n\nThank you so much for having me.", "created_at": "2019-10-09 17:25:12.981228", "updated_at": "2019-10-09 17:25:12.981228", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12891, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82711, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14351, "post_number": 3, "raw": "ping @marina,@Markus_D, @LauraRoddy", "created_at": "2020-09-03 12:29:05.201232", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 12:29:05.201232", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63295, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11411, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_This is a wiki where we collect information about the events to support Social Innovators and Entrepreneurs in the MENA region.

Another way to frame this is that by _walkaway_, Commoners threaten Elites with type-L collapse (\"scarcity of labor\", concept taken from [here](http://www.pitt.edu/~trenchea/NAPFF/Presentations/Eugenia_Kalnay_HANDY-population-ClimChange.pdf#page=39)). It solved inequality, the problem that caused the walkaway in the first place, but only for a time. Just as insightful policy change or political violence can solve inequality for a time only (Peter Turchin's _secular cycles_).\n\nBut what if the _walkaway_ solution becomes much more doable and comfortable through well developed, ready-made, open source solutions. Commoners would not choose it as a measure of last resort, but much earlier. As a result, inequality oscillations would be much less pronounced, mainstream society would be and stay more equal.\n\nBut for that, the parallel, DIY _walkaway society_ has to be a credible threat. It has to exist permanently, people have to choose this as their lifestyle, and it has to work well.\n\nMuch work to do :)", "created_at": "2017-11-08 22:37:32.836873", "updated_at": "2017-11-08 22:39:42.417365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 195, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [39184], "is_reply_to": [39184], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67578, "user_id": 5538, "topic_id": 12081, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Thats fair.

And the conversation will be exploring Noah's visions and thoughts of a utopian internet, as well as some of Noah's history. We've been talking quite a bit ahead of time. And we recently got introduced each other. And it was kinda with a shebang and a lot of checkboxes. \n\nTo give it a round about exploration of what you've explored previously, is it legal infrastructures mixed with AI and ethical complications that come thereof? And you've explored ethical hacking, and working with radically open security, as well as psychology and programming and many more it seems like, and now you're entering a master's program at Oxford? in like, two weeks? Yeah. To start off, if we if we go about it from a chronological order, where would that lead us to start?\n\nNoah:  \nI'm Noah. And I think my journey started as a politically aware and interested human being quite young, I was 12 or so when I really somehow caught fire for a topic that now is actually all over the world and more in the headlines, but back then was not so much. And it's really just like, how can we get to a world with hundred percent renewable energy as fast as possible. And that was my utopia, my first political utopia, that that really inspired me and got me going. \n\nAnd I came from a small town in southern Germany, and I started to like, travel to different places, try to like, you know, protests and all these things. This in touch with research institutions, and political institutions and things like all these things. And then there came a second phase at some point, because I realized, well, somehow in the end, in all these discussions that I had with politicians and lobbyists and activists, in the end, you know, like, we can all discuss this, and how, what's that there's an imperative how we need to change our world, due to the ecological boundaries of our world. But in the end, still, that the economic argument wins somehow. It always does in the political arena, or tends to, and I was really frustrated by that. And so it was like, Well, if the economic argument wins, maybe I should learn better how it works. And I really got into business ethics, and it was like back then, how can we reimagine how the economy and how businesses work, because to challenge that paradigm off that it's only about money making, and it's much more about human striving and the common good. And these are the contributions that companies should aim for. \n\nSo from there on, I realized once we drive companies and what really shapes them, but companies also can be really slow, or they can become really slow to develop there as well. The single force that right now is changing companies in the economy most is technology. And so if we get this one, right, if we can get the technological technology to change, then that's also a really good opportunity to just change how our economy works, and how our society works for the better. So like technology is what's right now is the moving pieces that right now are, are shaping new things, and we have the opportunity to co-shape, our generation has to come opportunity to co-shape these technological changes. And I think that's opportunity I want to take so that we can use the technology together with our human insights and intuitions and values to make a more humane society and economy.\n\nZenna:  \nSo I'm, I'm curious. Now, we've talked a little bit about this before about the technology being power. And we also talked about how Oxford was Hogwarts. And coders are the wizards up today, Framing it in that perspective, is an egalitarian world something worth fighting for? And if it is, what is technology and the knowledge thereof, what place does that have?\n\nNoah:  \nI think, like generally I find, it can turn philosophy very appealing, particular, to the very rough like John Rawls idea that inequality, that the generally there should be, first of all, in terms of freedoms, they should be equal, and everybody should have some basic civil liberties. And then when we look at material conditions, that to be very rough again, the different principle is that according to John Rawls is that an unequal division of resources is only then legitimate, if it actually benefits those that are least well off. So when when an unequal distribution can meet that, for example, that overall, there's just much more resources, including for the for the less than the least, will have to go around. And I think, right now we're definitely at a point I would say, where we don't justify our current system is not justified by that, by that standard, in the sense that we use technology often not centered on the most vulnerable people in our communities and societies very much on emerging goals that already happened to hold. \n\nAlso Silicon Valley culture, even if it purports to claim the world, to save the world, really is the end, although startups gets bought up by by venture capitalists that already are basically, that then again are owned by the ones that already currently own the world. Self-feeding. Exactly. And again, I find it sad that all this beautiful technology that could be built into really meaningful things in the end, like I mean, nobody says that all the social media companies we have now or all those giants needed to go to the direction they had to it was just that's the society in which technology arrived was one in which these kinds of innovations were immediately put into, under profit, maximizing pressure.\n\nZenna:  \nAnd copyright?\n\nNoah:  \nAnd copyrights is also one part of it. Yes, I could imagine very different ways of arriving there. But then again, I think my my philosophy that I developed around this is kind of really being willing to think, very radical, very big about how things could be different, but then really starting from where we are right now. So I really don't like just complaining about how things should be very different. And I gotta do fix. And it's also when I yeah, I mean, I didn't like only talking about business ethics, but I also got into social entrepreneurship and founded companies myself and try to try to not just talk about how business should be run differently, but I tried to do it. And it's hard. \n\nZenna:  \njust as a tidbit, what's goal that you found from your time in there, and I don't mean, goals as in capitalist values, but as in, what did you find that you brought with you on your new journey?\n\nNoah: \nI think generally, the, the methodologies of business can often be very useful if they are used to different ends. So like, basically, the idea of one Europe is to find a social business, to use business means for social ends to solve really social problems, and not for the kind of problems they've been conventionally associated with. But that's not an original thought. So even though I want to credit it, but I think one more additional thought that I had was kind of like that it really helped me to develop my own philosophy that I call pragmatic idealism. At this point, I can summarize in three models, and first kind of is hope without critical thinking, is just naivety, but critical thinking without hope is just cynicism. And then the second idea is confidence without humility, is just arrogance. But then humility, without confidence, is sheepishness.\n\nZenna:  \nAnd that's your own personal philosophy for how you see yourself throughout the world?\n\nNoah:  \nMore people that inspired us include Maria Popova, Bulgarian writer, but also many others. And then like the last sentence kind of is more like the synthesis of it all I would say, which is pragmatism without idealism is just opportunism. But idealism without pragmatism is just wishful thinking. So that's kind of my, that's my philosophy. That kind of is the goal, I would say, I found that pragmatism and idealism need to work together. Yeah, the, I think, especially like, the first two are probably more inspired by other people. Pragmatism and idealism, they live in the space between the two. And so really have ambitious goals, but also be really pragmatic, where you start with it.\n\nZenna: \nif we go back to the origin of the ambitious goals, so to speak, if you were to start sketching out the image of what those ambitious goals for, let's say, if you want to reshape the internet, plural, What would that look like for you?\n\nNoah:  \nThere can like I don't have like one overarching but I think I have several again, utopias for this, or different utopian visions. I took an international relations course in my undergrad degree in Amsterdam and social sciences and I was thinking about well, how does international relations in global politics fit into cyberspace that we increasingly live in, and the internet and, and just writing and trying to combine this global politics theories with these new technologies, and then I just for some reason, wrote these words like cyber peace and cyber war. And I just noticed that my computer some enough reason underlined cyber peace as like an unknown word, but CYBER WARS recommend. And then it actually was, and I looked up in different word processing programs, none of the new cyber peace, but all the new cyber war, I looked up in different almond dictionaries and make not all of the new cyber cyber war, but very few use cyber peace. And so it was just like, Well, that's interesting, the vocabulary that we have in the conceptual space of the internet, is we conceptualize it as war, we don't even know how to talk about it in terms of peace, because we don't have a word for it. And just that obvious asymmetry that it somehow needs to be a very aggressive and violent place, apparently out there. And this is the language we use. That kind of made me think there's some utopia missing. And they're starting to develop that a bit more in this economic context, initially, where and for example, what I find interesting is, when you look at cyber peace, maybe we look at peace in the real world first. And like there were always like ideas of world peace, they've always existed, but somehow we've not achieved it yet. So just one very common idea of world peace was always Immanual Kant, philosopher, who, in 1795, wrote an essay called perpetual peace, for some reason, the original, they basically purported that just the simple hypothesis kind of is the states with a republican constitutions of democracies, basically, they should all just guarantee each other security. And when they do that, then we could have an ever expanding unit of peace, because nobody would ever attempt to attack such a block of countries. And we could have an ever expanding unit of peace.\n\nZenna \nOne thing that's been discussed recently, especially in the realms of internet and internet infrastructures, is the issue of centralization. In that kind of utopian image of a block of peace, one can say a block of Empire, which would then set the frame for the rest of the world.\n\nNoah \nAbsolutely agree. And like, I think it's really interesting that like, actually back then, again, I don't want to get too much into wrap Kant up. He said, We don't need a centralized contract or institution for this. We don't need a treaty for this, this would just emerge out of enlightenment, basically, enlightened actions of, of individuals and countries, again, 18th century philosophy maybe doesn't completely extend the internet. But I think there are some interesting things when you actually apply it. \n\nAnd again, because the internet is a very different beast. If you look at the long term trends, again, we have not achieved real peace. But overall, we live in a more peaceful world than ever like than ever before. In less than two years, we did have a lot of progress. And I think we should continue to have that progress. Because right now, when we speak about the internet, we just speak a lot about, like, there's a lot of outs, and so insecure and get cybercrime and a cyber war between the countries and all that. And I think that what we really should aim for is really to have this this utopian vision and how I think that can actually happen in cyberspace, much more than in real world, think cyberspace is actually could be a much more peaceful place, then then, then the world we live in physically. And that is because of the different dynamics of security in the cyberspace. It's very asymmetric. And it's very different from other security, thinking of like 20th century Cold War thinking, which often has been the only dominant security paradigm has been applied the internet, because the common story is internet you just, like you don't know who's your attacker, basically, it's very difficult to do attribution of attackers. So you just want to develop your own offensive capability and hack everyone. And you can just do it in the face with us I've been doing in Russia, I've been doing in China for doing, many other countries aspire to do. And there's also again, like the superpowers that are emerging, it's basically trying to copy this old patterns into this new world. And I don't think, first of all, I don't think that's how it's going to work out. And first of all, don't think it's desirable, and it doesn't work that way. And that's because because of this asymmetry and the internet, that you don't know who your attacker really is, attribution is very difficult. So you can't retaliate, just to keep because you have offensive capabilities, right? Because you have cyber weapons, because you have the vulnerabilities that you know about, exploits that you can enter into other systems. Just because you can attack someone doesn't mean that they want to attack you, because you again, the offensive capability you have is not a deterrence against somebody else's attack, which in the physical world is very different. If you have a nuclear bomb, you know, the other person is not going to bump you so much because you can bomb them back. This logic of, of Cold War in that sense doesn't work anymore in the internet. A second reason for that is basically you can destroy somebody else's offensive capability by building up your own defenses. So if you do really good, actually security for yourself, and if you do security research, and you find vulnerabilities and you find zero days, then you can basically destroy the offensive capabilities of others because they rely on these vulnerabilities. And so, you know, if I have a nuclear bomb, just because you build some protection doesn't mean I don't have a nuclear bomb. But if I have a zero day, which is basically an exploit to which no fixes there yet, and you close that, that gap, that I don't have a bomb anymore, I don't have a weapon anymore. So basically, you can take away somebody else's offensive capability by building good defenses. I think these dynamics have not been fully understood by policymakers.\n\nZenna:  \nIs that something you would call sign of peace? You can build up defenses and by having a safety rather than offensive?\n\nNoah: \nYeah, I think like that, when my vision for several pieces that states should end and everything out everybody else, I don't think security must always be so state-centric, my vision for cyberpeace is that, basically everybody in a certain union, and it doesn't have to be a contractual union, works towards building collective defenses. So basically, these are two very basic things. zero day reporting, a global norm for zero day reporting, that's countries that join a certain even even even just an idea that they would never did follow this idea can start to report zero days and never include and never improve not only their security, but security of everybody else. And again, like many people might say that sounds so super idealistic. And I don't think it is, I think it is very pragmatic reasons to do so. Because if you're part of this defensive union, then you can really you will be much safer than if you're if you don't share any of you zero days, and you twist try to get keep and build your own offensive capabilities for all the reasons that I've named, because on offensive capabilities can be destroyed by enemies, and because of having offensive capability is not a deterrent against attacks.\n\nZenna:  \nSo if you have a union, there must be something that's in it for them, there's the <CAN\"T INTERPRET THIS WORD>  Is that what you imagine, for a utopian internet?\n\nNoah:  \nGenerally, again, I would apply this kind of Kantian idea that in the end, we want to live on a peaceful planet or in a peaceful cyberspace. My vision is that we, in the end have a safe space in the internet and that place in that sense that we start by creating small safe spaces, and they start expanding until in the end, hopefully they cover I always think that will be like, there will always be cyber attacks. But we can minimize the impact that we can increase our the integrity of our of everybody's experience in the internet by for example, having a global norm for zero day reporting. And I find what I like about the global norm for zero day reporting is it encourages everyone to contribute to everyone's security, because you can't just close the zero day vulnerability for yourself, you do it for everyone. And at the same time, the only them that basically you create is the people that don't want to work together to make everyone's experience safer. And the them is basically the people that want to keep the exploits to, for example, I don't know, whether it is NSA hackers, or whether this malicious Russian hackers or whatever, whatever groups, only the people that kind of want to be able to really attack other people systems are then kind of that that will be against, I think the what would I like with this is it's not so much that I have a very clear institutional setup, how this would work, because obviously, it's very difficult to control these kind of things. Exactly. So I don't it's not fully developed. But I think it's kind of like my point is more like this narrative shift from we talked about a place where there's a lot of war happening, cyber war, to a place where cyber peace is possible, and where we should make sense of peace, not cyber law or cyber war.\n\nZenna: \nWhose responsibility is it to make this shift happen?\n\nNoah: \nI think in the end, it's everyone's, but I think, if I should put my my my hope on, for example, individual institutions, I think institutions that are very well set to do this, or where I have realistic hope for this is the European Union. So if the European Union were to start such a project, where it say, okay, we, as a group of countries decided we want to start a norm, that what everyone ought to report zero days, because it's better for everyone to do that. I think that could be very powerful. And I know that the current administration, for example, in the US, which obviously controls the most powerful capability there is not going to willing to do that. But I hope that that could change given also the large trajectory of history, I hope that it is possible. Also for other countries, I hope that they that in the same way that we didn't think it seemed impossible to ever start a counter proliferation movement in the nuclear age. And it seems we will for eternity, always just create more bombs to kill each other. We now actually live a world where there's still too many bombs, but at least less than 50 years ago. And in the same way, I have a hope that in 50 years, I know it's a long shot. And it's not going to happen overnight. And right now, all the talks on your end level are basically non existent on this topic. So it's I really hope that we could live in a world where we have less, not more attacks and more integrity of everybody's devices.\n\nZenna: \nYou've been working a bit with AI and machine learning, and specifically on the focus of whether it's ethical, if placed in a legal system. Do you want to expand on that?\n\nNoah:  \nYeah, of course. So I think kind of like that was my work that I started, or did two years ago that I kind of talked about this narrative shift to cyber peace. And what I didn't like about it is that it was apart from that it was like state centric, and that there were many practical problems with it and very long shot, it was still defensive, it was still like it's talking about my utopia is security or safety, which is still something like the absence of violence. That's the problem with peace. Also, you know, it's not medicine super positive, it's only that bad things are not there. And so I was like, I want something more positive than that. And and that's then where I got also more into this AI space. And because I think they're really there is opportunity to positively shape human thriving in many ways. And to unlock this potential that we need to avoid many risks that are often also discussed and that are very real. And the as I said, also, I wonder, and they I feel I don't have this super clean utopia, because somehow every utopia that involves machines that can do more than we do, in some sense, apparently ends up being a dystopia sometimes. And so we have to still do a lot of work on which utopia, we actually want out there.\n\nZenna: \n In your utopia, does AI exist?\n\nNoah: \nIn my utopia. Again, I'm a pragmatic idealist. So my somehow my ideals are also based on my pragmatism. And I think there is not a world possible. Like we cannot, I don't know if you heard about the unabomber, who's like a, like a guy who started basically bombing scientists, because he believed that the progress of science and technology would destroy human society. And given that I don't think that's a viable path that we will have, that we will basically live with less technology, then the question is, how can we shape the current trends and the current technologies that are rising to human benefit? And also maybe sometimes also, how can we consciously decide not to use them? Yeah, we can sometimes do that. \n\nBut overall, I'm convinced that we will get machines that will be better than humans at many tasks that currently only humans can do. Given that that's going to come, the question is, how do we want to do that? I think their biggest problem are, exactly about human centrism. So how can we make sure that they align with our values and their <unknown>? Like that's a long term perspective, I would say all this question, which is kind of like AI governance questions that says when, for example, pioneered by Nick Bostrom, the whole ideas of what do we do when general AI actually is smarter than humans? I think these are super valuable questions to do with and to research. \n\nBut then there's also the short term questions, and that's what we're after dealing with these important questions of, if we already today have for example, a system that makes legal decisions, for example, in an administration and that public administration, what laws do we want to be imbued into that? Do we think it's just fine if there's some human mandate and humans and some democratically elected institution decides now we want this to be done by an AI? Or do we also think there needs to be some outputs that need to be in some material sense fair, as it just if it's if it's cheaper and faster do we just accept it? Or do we also want to actually be able to understand the process to be accessible for humans, because then many advanced machine learning programs, currently, they're black boxes for us, so we can't really understand them. \n\nAnd the other question is, well, if it's trained on any human data, human centric data, also in that sense, then it's going to take human vices with it, and it could even aggregate them and exaggerate them. And so yeah, there's a lot of open questions, and I don't really have full answers to those yet. But my utopia is just I can only explain it in very abstract terms at this point, because there's a lot of research and thinking and testing and acting to be done on this field. But right now, it's to reap the benefits to avoid the risks, and to make sure that we humanize the technology that we live with, in the sense that in the sense that we really challenge also what it means to be human for ourselves, because I don't think we know right now what it means to be human. And if we first figure out like, or if we figure out what it means to be human, then we can also tell when we want technology to do to help us to thrive.\n\nZenna: \nThank you so much for forth your thoughts. I'm that feeling that we will hear more from you.\n\nNoah: \nWell, thank you very much for giving me this space.

This is because a complicated model with many moving parts, while it is computer-runnable, it is not as human-interpretable. A possible angle of attack is to treat issues separately, by building three models: endogenous preferences, but no money; money, but exogenous preferences; both money and endogenous preferences.

Goodwin's model implicitly assumes a product made of things, physical stuff; so it makes sense to impose zero growth, like Marco does, in the long run.

Today we're talking to Pablo Velasco.  He's an assistant professor at Aarhaus University. And you have a history, at least with your PhD, on researching blockchain? \n\nPablo:\nYes. \n\nZenna:\nAnd currently, what's your focus? \n\nPablo:\nI still research blockchain to some degree because that's what I'm known for in the academic world. But I'm also interested in decentralized web in general, and automation processes in general.  Especially creative automation processes. \n\nZenna:\nYeah. So we haven't had this conversation yet in private. I look forward to having that one too about the decentralized web. But to start off, I'm really curious about what journey brought you to wanting to study blockchain. How does it begin? And was there a societal perspective to this? \n\nPablo:\nYes, that's my, my my approach always. Like, politics and social elements of technology, in this case blockchain. The first thing is that I started studying in my very early years, electrical engineering, because I really much it was very much into computers, technology and that kind of stuff. I was building my own computers. And I started that career. And then at some point, I started reading philosophy, I started reading Nietzsche, and I was still kind of young.\n\nZenna:\n Which one?\n\nPablo:\nThis was the  posthumous writings, so like a bunch of separate non order writings. And I got really engaged with that. So I left... \nZenna:\nWhat ideas got you engaged with that? \n\nPablo:\nI think it was more the type of questioning, because in electrical engineering, you will have very static ways to think about the world. Yeah, I was more pragmatic, more utilitarian. And these were questions about existence and why are we here? And what who questions are power, for example, right? So at some point that became more interesting for me to pursue to some degree. So I applied to a philosophy place in a modern University. And I got accepted. So I did, I made that jump. So technology always seemed like sub subterranean to some degree to my further background. Yeah. And then later, when I finish my master, I was still in philosophy, very metaphysics question actually. And I started using Linux, which I always I always have the tingle of it. It's been about 10 years now, since it started Linux and I was very driven by this idea kind of community enabled, instead of business capitalist kind of ideology behind it. So I was very much into it. So when I finish my master, I start looking for technology again, but always from this social perspective. So Linux was like that. The jumping port. Yeah. And then I have to select something to study there was kind of on that avenue. And I cared about Bitcoin at that moment. That was 2012-13. So it was already there, but still not on a mainstream level. And I thought, well, this is this was a great case study, right, because it's about decentralizing and making, building a system from a community. \n\nZenna:\nOkay, so you mentioned a word right there that I think is very interesting to also find out what it means to you. Because it's a word that is used a lot recently. But it has a lot of different meanings. So \"communities\" is one, I think most people have a similar sense of that one. But: decentralized. What does decentralized mean to you from a more society perspective, as you said, like technology is a little bit easier to discern what's decentralized, because the average take on what decentralized means, but societely, what does that mean for you? Is that a power question? Is that a community question? Is that a structural question? \n\nPablo:\nI think it's definitely a structural one in terms of hierarchy. Right. So political systems.  \nMost historical political systems have have been based in strong hierarchies. So yeah, I think you have a decentralization leans towards something that is distributed in a different way. But it's still it's kind of blurry, because, yes, I think it's a word that is used too much.  Like a buzzword it has currency, but it's rarely defined, in part because it's difficult. Right. And I think it's very interesting that you mentioned not technology, but social because I think a lot of projects tend to mixed those two, and you kind of are confused which one they are talking about. Right. And it happened. I mean, my research was many bitcoins during my PhD. And there was a struggle for the centralization, but most of the time, it was meant socially, whatever that meant. But it was enacted technologically. So there was a like a gap, a gap. Yeah, like, almost, I'm missing the word, but a bit of psychotic difference in between those split. Yes. So what I will say is that you don't necessarily have to look on technological advancements to think about some sort of decentralized structures, right?\n \nA lot of communities and working environments not a lot, a few, a few exist. They exist. And they don't necessarily need a technological medium to exist. Right. \n\nZenna:\nAnd you mentioned that to me like co ops. Yes. Or community run daycare. \n\nPablo:\nSo yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think the co-op is the great example. Where systems of power are some degree decentralized. Right. In in more specific political examples, the Zapatistas in Mexico is not decentralized, per se, still like a representational system to some degree, but it makes a lot, it puts a lot of emphasis on having discussions from the grass roots and finding consensus from the grassroots before, instead of, someone deciding. \n\nZenna:\nit's where the masses of power are located in a society, yeah, yeah. community or in a some cases technology. Yes, yes. And that's a very interesting thing that you mentioned that, because I've felt that a lot myself actually where it's been a difficult path to maneuver between the decentralized webs and the blockchain cryptocurrency world, because they'll both use the same terminology of decentralization. I think I've seen recently that \"distributed systems\" is a term that's used often and like the decentralized distributed realms more maybe to differentiate from the only technological aspect that goes with the decentralized. I don't know, but it was a really interesting thought that I'd never put down so concretely before in my own head. Yeah. So thank you.\n\nPablo:  \nIf I could say a bit more about that. Another thing that I think we're putting in the table is that - and I carry these from a guy a researcher called David Colombia, Columbia a few years ago in a conference - is that there's like an assumption that decentralization is good and better and an improvement. And I believe most of the times it is, but he questioned that.  He was like, Yes, but why? Why are we assuming that that's that's an improvement? Right? So I don't have an answer for that actually. But I think it's important to ask not only how do we decentralize things, but also like, why are we Why should we decentralized certain things aren't and maybe not not everything right. \n\nZenna:\nAnd it's a highly politically subjective perspective probably too. I'd imagine that most people who also promote decentralization also promote the more liberal I guess it's called, of the political compass style. \n\nPablo:\nYes, the more libertarian approach, they will say that, that will also be very much in favor of a kind of decentralization that is not the same as the co-op, right? Not exactly. And in in that sense. There are cool projects like the <UNKNOWN> and I researcher that gathers modern cooperative projects. And he calls like platform corporative activism. \n\nZenna:\nCool. \n\nPablo:\nSo it's like, but the emphasis on deck operatives and how technology helps them, but not the other way around. Right? Yeah. \n\nZenna:\nCool. I'm going to ask you about that afterwards. So, I wanted to bring this back, though, because you mentioned that you found blockchain during 2012. And you started your PhD writing about it. And before we started this conversation, you gave me a tidbit, which was also the term \"utopia\", which you mention has been played a big role for you and your writings. Specifically, you mentioned the differences between utopias. Does this is also tie into decentralization?  Are they weaved together? \n\nPablo:\nI think they are, at least in their ambiguity. Yeah.  I mean, I haven't worked very publicly on the concept we talking about, but that was a narrative argument that was in my PhD dissertation for sure. Part of the narrative it was it was like, and it was applied to each of the different meanings of utopia, One is: Why does there no place in the says that a non physical place or non existing place, right, so a lot of that is about cyberspace, the, the inner we inherited from the 90s. And that kind of stayed still there. That cyberspace is in office. Yes, exactly. So yeah, and not even physical, but like a no-space. Let's call it like that. Yeah, there's that tinge of utopia that comes from from from before.\n\nThere is also the the idea of a place that is to be achieved. So something that has to come to be yet. And that that's what I think decentralization is really tied to it because it's also like something will happen. And when it happens, things are gonna be different. And we cannot know and if it's utopia, it'll be different in a good way. Yes. There is also the utopia that is not meant to be reachable, right? There no place that the moment you reach it is no longer the no-place. Right? It's it becomes the place. I know. It's it's a bit cryptic, to some degree, but utopia is also something that it's always in the idea and remains in the idea. \n\nZenna:\nAnd I think it can't really exist in reality, because reality is never utopia. \n\nPablo:\nYeah, yeah. And that's kind of the the use of of it. Not something like negative right is the use of it. \n\nZenna:\nAnd these three levels is something to aim for. \n\nPablo:\nYes, exactly. Yeah. And I think there's three levels of different kinds of utopia. You see them in, in different ways in in, in decentralization-driven projects, right. That's the way I use it, at least in my in my work.\n\nZenna:\nThat ties very well into the narratives that are happening with the solar punk movement as well. \n\nPablo:\nYeah. But I think it's important to separate which one is which, right, which one is it's it works as an ideology in a good sense. And which one is more elusive and more...\n\nZenna:\nBeautifying. \n\nPablo:\nBeautifying? \n\nZenna:\nYeah, like creating a utopia, image - a utopian image in the sense that in \"1984\" They used a Peace Institute instead of War. Yeah. It's like beautifying the world or utopia-fying. Yeah, that's fascinating. And then that also becomes a question of, is it subjective or not.\n\nPablo:\nOof! You ask me questions like that, and yes my background is philosophy...\nbut I will say that part part of the... subjective is maybe an important word here because it kind of separates..It is not individual. Like subjective is not necessarily individual, right, which is the kind of more Silicon Valley I will say,<UNKNOWN> oriented idea, individuals that are mediated by technology and that's a good thing in itself. And I think this, the other kind of more complex idea for a subject is a subject that is not an individual. It's a subject in a community, for example, that is made a subject because it's in a community and there's where you have the co-op more linked. \n\nSo when you ask me if it's subjective, I immediately think of which kind of subject. \n\nZenna:\nIs it a community subject or is it an individual subject. While we were talking about communities and Silicon Valley, it brought me into something I'm just curious to ask you and see your take on because I've been pondering it in my own head and I have not come to a conclusion yet. The topic is DAOs: decentralized autonomous organizations. And from my perspective, it's been curious because I've heard a lot of people mention DAOs that was of course, and, and tokenization of organizations in order for automating them, and with the subject in this case would be for the community or for the individual to speak. That's my own thought pattern around DAOs. Yes. Have you been thinking about DAOs? Is that like, as a part of your realm and studying blockchain? \n\nPablo:\nI mean, it is there of course because it's it's a topic that...It's around. I haven't written or thought specifically about that. But I think because in great part I related it with the DAO kind of attempt and failure from from a few years ago, right.\n\nBut I think tokenization it's a topic that is closer to where I have been thinking. And one of my issues actually, with about blockchain projects, is that they tokenize. I mean, a lot of the early blockchain designs, they were based on tokenization. Right on a production of units. That was similar to production of economic unit before it. So token: I think part of the the issue well, I don't know if it's an issue, but part of what I see as a problem is that tokens are related to economic units, like small units of value, that kind of organize the relationship. Right? And in that sense, it lands too close to the economical systems that we already have. Right. So for me, the idea of the token is very tied to pre existing economies that the quality is that getting rid of those economies right, going beyond those. On the other hand, it's not like I know exactly what will be a good replacement or attempt. \n\nZenna:\nSpeaking of good replacement seminars, are there any projects that you've encountered on your journey that you've been like, wow, they're kind of on to something. You know what I mean? \n\nPablo:\nYes, but I guess I have to say that not that many.\n\nZenna:  \nIs it that you have high standards?  \nmaybe to broaden your radius?\n\nPablo:  \nI think my problem was, I mean, it was very invested in the early years, like 2012 to 2016 or 17, and my main problem was that most of the projects will have a very, very verbose way of presenting the project and then they will be a replication of other systems, right. Like a lot of alternative currencies, which are not a trendy thing to say now, now you say decentralized apps, but but the way they work is not that different. So it's just like a new... \n\nZenna:\nt's a lot of tag words. cuz they use the technology. Yeah, blockchain technology. Yeah, this system is the same. \n\nPablo:\nYeah, exactly. And most of them will phrase their projects in in radically different ways. And then you will see that the working it was exactly the same right as as other crypto. So I guess it's hard to we can be very blinded by the amount of projects, if you could see the list of decentralized apps are there. They're massive, right? But, but when you go beyond that and start to see like, well, what's a specific difference and of this one, you see that there, you can cluster them in relatively easy, you can also check, like which degree of development they had, most don't have that much development. So from the massive amount of projects that you can see, it's easy to decimate that number. And then... \n\nZenna:\nbecause of the similarities\n\nPablo:\nI will say that it's less that the centralized projects but I have found interesting and more the, the loops that go back to the cooperative, and then the technology they use is like the secondary thing, right. And in that sense, I mean, the decent project was was an interesting one that eventually was kind of implemented to some degree, at least in Barcelona or some other communities, that it started like that, right, like, like, it was part of it was like a cryptocurrency at some point. And but it ended up being to some degree, successfully implemented for a different way to relate related to government. But then again, it was because I think tech was a bit secondary. And the main point was like, how do we reorganize this between people for people? Yeah. So and that kind of those kind of projects is the ones that you don't see that often. Many because it, there's, they're small, right? And they don't have like venture capital or big websites or anything like that. So that's why this idea of platform corporate activism listing is interesting because you see that it's, it may be a really small project in a small community, in Ireland, or in your country. And for me, that's the really interesting part. \n\nZenna:\nSo when we go into the fact that there's a lot of smaller projects out there in the realms of more social action. Yeah. And then secondary technology. We have the case in a lot of the mainstream, more default internet, as we know it, that there's also a lot of misinformation going around. Do you think that there could be a point in also having these smaller initiatives of technology? \nOr do you see that there's a risk in the smaller initiatives existing and then not learning from each other because they're too small? Or in the in the space of worldwide webs? Yeah. to local smaller initiatives?\nHow do you fare?\n\nPablo:  \nI think I'm more driven to local networks even if they are disconnected between each other in great part because there is different ways and things to solve in regions, right? So kind of having like a magical solution or technology solution or something our organization solution for a really broad spectrum of people. I think that's really complicated, probably destined to not work because of the differences in localism. Right and coming back to Zapatistas in Mexico. Part of their speech is that attempting to replicate them in other countries and other contexts is like, that's absurd, right? \n\nZenna:\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, did they not train in the forest? And secret for like, 10 years or something? Yeah, it was like that. \n\nPablo:Yeah, it was about 10. He was kind of small guerillas. I mean, it has a very interesting history. So they came out in 94. But since the 80s or so. But yeah, the it's a really long project, right? It's a very interesting project, but the it has 30-40 years in the working and, and it's local. I mean, it's it's about a certain region in certain communities in Mexico, and for that they made it work in a beautiful and very utopian way.\n\nBut then again, if you just take like that risk recipe, and try to apply it in, in Denmark or whichever region, it's, it's probably not gonna work, of course, because it's important to take care of the context. And that's why local communities and local networks even, cannot communicate between each other. For me that's kind of quite relevant. \n\nZenna:\nEspecially in today's globalized world. Yeah, getting resources from all over the planet and shipping it all over the planet. Yeah, that's something huge amounts of co2 all over the planet. It feels like also finding local solutions could be a good key. \n\nYeah. So we're going to wrap this up on this lovely note of globalization and Zapatistas. Thank you for a wonderful conversation. Thank you. And yeah, any last notes you want to throw in there?\n\nPablo:  \nNo, I'm just glad that these kind of channels exist. And that we keep asking questions about these topics like not just answering right now just trying to offer solutions. \n\nZenna:\nThere's also like, many questions to keep asking before coming with a concrete pre-packaged \"Buy Now 99%.\"\n\nWell, yes.

I find it a pleasant and welcoming place to let my ideas set, so i hope you don't mind i do it once again]** \n\nSome of you maybe remember that i own [Fermenthings](http://www.fermenthings.be), a fermentation centered space for which i wrote [a little call a couple of months ago](https://edgeryders.eu/t/searching-for-puzzle-pieces-to-complete-a-circular-food-project/9840) already. Now that the place is settled, that we are organizing weekly workshops, brunches & have a selection of 100 products in the shop, i'm looking for 2020 into the empty space we still have on the mezzanine above the shared space with La Source brewpub.\n\nWhile the current project is a more straightforward business, i want this upper space to go back to part of my roots a societal and cultural event organizer but anchor it in a food environment. So what's the idea? Well i got inspired after reading a couple of books about forgotten writers of the enlightenment period, more specific the story of the Paris salons by [Holbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_d%27Holbach) & [Diderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot) where the birth of the encyclopedia was given and people like Hume or Adam Smith where frequent guests.   \n\n**\"Le discutoire\"- \"Speakplenty\"**\n\nWhile the salons from the 18th century where still a bourgeois get together payed by the baron or other wealthy Samaritans, the space had an openness of thinking never seen before. It's the latter part i'm interested in and find a contemporary twist to it. That is why i want to combine two ideas: the elegance of discussion of the salon and the wittiness of the speak-easy, clandestine bars in time of the prohibition. And so the \"Discutoire\" is born. \n\nI will accommodate around 20 seats, giving it a feel of a grandmothers salon, making it cozy and warm. It will have a library settled on food & Urbanisme in the first place. And a small bar where guest cooks, barista, mixologues will be able to share their passion. It will not be promoted on social media, just have a ear to mouth promotion. You will need to pass the Kombucha brewer and look if the light is on. \n\nThe space should be a space for when you want to have a discussion, try new things, study & share. Where we can think about how food needs to reflect our societal transition & how we can better the living conditions of our city. \n\n**Timing: Mid 2020**\n\nI still have around six months to make it a working space. But i wanted to share it here first, because i would love to have Edgeryders (as in people from the community) seeing it as a space where they can discuss, have debates and eat good food and drink good products.

Energy requirements for drying fresh produce are about 0.3 kWh/kg, 2-3 times lower than for otherwise comparable but much less DIY freeze-drying. So with 3 kWh daily excess electricity from a 1000 W photovoltaics off-grid plant, one could dry 10 kg of produce, or 20 kg if using ~40 \u00b0C thermal heat for 50% of the energy needs. Processing times are 20 min to 2 hours per batch, also much lower than the 24 h to 36 h for freeze-drying. Materials needed are just a used household microwave, a used household fridge compressor, some tubing and cabling, and an Arduino microcontroller. Probably together still below 100 EUR. With adaptations for running on 12-24 V DC instead, probably below 250 EUR.\n\nFor those wanting to try: the gory details are after a little sketch.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7400547a78a93e85ed67b3d52a04c53e0161bfa3.jpg\" width=\"571\" height=\"500\">\n\n\n## The gory details\n\n<strong>It's not freeze drying.</strong> The proposal is a DIY microwave vacuum dryer that consumes excess photovoltaics energy and excess heat. This is not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-drying\">freeze drying</a>, because the product is never frozen (thereby also preventing damage through freezing). Instead, the phase change will always be between liquid and vapor, but accelerated greatly by vacuum and microwaves, which makes the processing times so short that the above-ambient temperatures do not damage or microbiologically spoil the products.\n\n<strong>Process requirements.</strong> The process is commercially developed by (for example) EnWave, calling it the \"<a href=\"https://www.enwave.net/how-it-works\">Radiant Energy Dehydration (REV)</a>\" process. According to this sources and an older [nutraRev Fact Sheet](http://www.enwave.net/media/downloads/nutraREV-Fact-Sheet.pdf) that vanished from their redesigned website, the process can use an input temperature of 37 \u00b0C even for meat products. Which seems to mean, the 37 \u00b0C can be applied as thermal energy, and additional energy is applied via microwaves. So the process works at all pressures where water boils at 37 \u00b0C or below. Which means about 6000 Pa according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#Crystal_phase_diagrams\">phase diagram of water</a>.\n\n<strong>Parts to use.</strong> These low vacuum requirements are good news, as it allows to use a recovered standard fridge compressor as the vacuum pump, which can achieve pressures down to about 1500 Pa (as demonstrated <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Vb_9HWAjCgQ\">in this video</a> by boiling water at 15 \u00b0C). It is also (probably) possible to combine two such compressors in series to achieve a better vacuum. Finally, DIY building of a vacuum chamber from a kitchen dish, plus suction hoses, is explained in another video, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qckdVa_UF4\">How to Make a Freeze Dryer</a>\". The last part is getting the moisture out of the vacuum \u2013 either by just using the vacuum pump (if it does not get damaged that way) or by using a condenser as in freeze dryers: a cold surface to remove the moisture by freezing it, possibly provided with a small Peltier element. In freeze dryers, this surface is usually -50 \u00b0C, while in our case (due to the less perfect vacuum), -10 \u00b0C to -20 \u00b0C would be enough. In addition, we will need a microwave oven; the cheapest solution is a thrown-out AC grid microwave. Solar thermal input (at about 40 \u00b0C) is also good, as it reduces the amount of microwave energy needed.\n\n<strong>Operation.</strong> So one would place a dish of food under a vacuum bowl (normal kitchen glas bowl) into the microwave, extract the air, and apply microwaves. The process duration would depend on available excess photovoltaic energy, but under optimum conditions would be 20 min to 2 hours (<a href=\"http://www.enwave.net/nutrarev.php\">as specified</a> for the EnWave nutraRev system).\n\n<strong>Energy costs.</strong> Energy costs are 0.23 USD per kg of dried berries <a href=\"http://www.enwave.net/nutrarev.php\">for nutraRev</a>, which at about 0.12 USD/kWh U.S. electricity costs maps to 2 kWh / kg of dried berries. Now berries (blueberries in this example) have a 85% water content, meaning the energy need is 2 kWh / (1 kg / 0.15) = 0.3 kWh / kg of fresh blueberries.\n\n  So for comparison: If you have a 8 m\u00b2 photovoltaics off-grid plant plant, that's about 1000 W(p), and maps to at least 3 kWh \"freely available\" excess energy per day in summer, which you just don't need for normal living. You can dry 10 kg of fruits per day with this. Or probably 20 kg, by also using thermal solar input energy compared to the all-electric energy used in the EnWave process. Seems decent for preserving excess food from dumpster diving quick enough :)\n\n<strong>Sealing and storing the food.</strong> For storing the food \"with a shelf-life of 24.5 years\", it seems to be enough to just put it into containers and vacuum-seal them (again using the fridge compressor as vacuum pump). One can additionally put oxygen absorbers into them (which is just iron oxide), or rely on vacuum alone. These techniques are explained in the video \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gothlufqKA4\">5 Year Food Storage: Lisa B on Freeze Dried Storage Methods</a>\". So there is no (strict) need to replace the vacuum with an inert gas and sealing the product in this atmosphere, as usually done in commercial settings.\n\n\n## Usage in the lab\n\nRevisiting this idea for a possible use as a small-scale lab dryer, I'll add the following thoughts:\n\n* There will be a bit of an issue with shielding the microwave radiation as we need to route the vacuum tube through the wall of the microwave oven. However letting it make a 90\u00b0 bend right after exiting the wall and adding metal shielding so that the tube is sandwiched between the microwave oven and the additional shielding will probably fix this. There are handheld microwave leak sensors that could be used to prove that this shielding works.\n\n* A Peltier element inside the vacuum chamber to remove the water vapor through freezing of course won't work. It contains wires, and metal in a microwave means lots of sparks \u2026 . The Peltier element can however be mounted in a second part of the vacuum chamber, located outside of the microwave and connected by a vacuum-proof tube. Water gas molecules travelling through the tube would hit the Peltier element on the other side and freeze stuck to it. With that arrangement of the cold element outside the microwave oven, there is more space and instead of a Peltier element it would be possible to use the inner parts of a commercial deep freezer to create a way more energy efficient cold element that easily reaches -20 \u00b0C.\n\n* Using fridge compressors as vacuum pumps is highly experimental and would need fixing the lubrication issue that happens when not operating them in a closed loop environment like a fridge where the lubricant is mixed into the pumped medium. Without a closed loop, lubricant has to be continuously added at the input side of the compressor somehow, or it will run dry and break soon. So for a lab device, better use an off-the-shelf vacuum pump.", "created_at": "2014-09-09 22:37:23", "updated_at": "2018-12-25 22:34:47.619747", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1301, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 13011.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26748, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3426, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Are you still on this?</b>\n\nHi <a href=\"/u/justine2020\">@Justine2020</a>, so I think now would be a great time to flesh out the press release.\n\nTell me what you think of this: we had a <a href=\"/t/community-call-28-august-2014-writeup/3533\">community call today</a> and there is this idea to have a twitter press conference in September to announce Lote4.

Too much is in flux, starting from... the number of attendees, and the number of rooms we will be using simultaneously! But we are almost there; people have been recruiting session speakers. What we need is an empty grid, tenative as it might be. The easiest thing is to have three rooms, one for each track. Then divide each day into seven one-hour slots (9.30 to 12-30 am, then 2.30 to 6.30 pm); finally, allocate some time for the unPilgrim to be all together (example: Tuesday evening, welcome and mingling, no work; Thurdsay evening, unHalloween Party; Saturday lunch, Pasta Party...). Time is not allocated to cross-track activities is allocated to track-specific sessions. That gives us 4 days x 3 tracks x 7 slots = 84 slots. Some of the sessions, maybe most, will use two or more slots, but that's still a lot of slots! Maybe we should slice away one day, start on the 30th instead.</li>\n\n<li>if a session feels they need an allocated time slot now, let its proponent simply grab it.

There are 2 types of interviews: one to test the problem and one to test the solution. In all the cases you should adopt a detective mindset and pose questions that would help you to understand the deep motivations / concerns / pains / incentives of the customer in order to test your riskiest assumptions. So please, no surveys, questionnaires, focus groups at this stage!\n\nYou should do the interviews on your own instead of relying on consultants or employees because you are the one who got the idea, you have to listen to the customers because you may have insights that the problem is not relevant or the solution is not interesting for the customers and if it\u2019s done by someone else, you might disagree with the results thinking that the consultant didn\u2019t do his job correctly and you proceed and this is a big mistake or the employees could do it wrong because this is not their idea and they are not the entrepreneurs. So you should take the bull by the horns and do it yourself because if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself!\n\n![lean-startup-customer-development-interview-44-638|638x479](upload://dnUVbca0RsWN6qE39dMe0ASrI6U.jpeg) \n\nPosing the right questions is very important to get validated learning from your customers and avoid subjective answers. This is why you should avoid doing customer interviews with your family and friends and you should ask the right questions that prevent even your mom can\u2019t be subjective in her answers.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/geeZqaHaX80\n\nYou should also adopt a beginner\u2019s mind and avoid jumping too quickly to the solution or showing the customers powerpoint presentations or demos.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to a very good video on the common mistakes in customer interviews and how to do it right. I recommend that you watch it : \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3syNbgSkwE\n\nYou should also put the customer at ease and let him talk and lead the conversation. So listen more than you talk, use active listening and ask follow \u2013 up questions: Why? Why? Why?...\n\nHow many people you should talk to?\n\nSometimes you can get good results from just 4-5 customer discovery interviews. If, after 10+ interviews, findings have not converged, your customer segment may be too fuzzy.\n\nSome experts consider that you should keep interviewing until you no longer hear things that surprise you, which often takes 15-20 interviews. Ask for 5 minutes (consumer / B-to-C), 20 minutes (B-to-B).\n\nAs usual we had interesting questions from the participants. Some of them have been already mentioned by  [ **@khouloud.ouesleti** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/khouloud.ouesleti). You still can ask me questions if you would, using this thread.\n\nThank you again for your time and attention.

The platform and its content -- as suggested by Alberto -- of course tells the story by itself, it's all there ! And it is a living thing, you see the organism in full if you take time to look at it in action.\n\nBut, but,\u00a0*reviewers* (and I ask you to believe me, I've played that role quite a few times).\u00a0You have to put yourself in the skin of a reviewer when deciding what/how/why to deliver. Think of this person, reading about OpenCare a week before the review (sometimes more, but reading ahead of time doesn't mean\u00a0giving more time reviewing the project). Think of this person who wants to get information in a synthesized way, yet who wants to get a \"feeling\" about what's going on.\n\nSo, my take is, it's worth to put up a short, crisp, one or two pager that gives an overview of the deliverable. That tells this person where to go on the portal and what is to find there. You guys are professionnals at communicating ideas with so much enthusiasm. I am sure you all know what I am talking about.\n\nI know <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana\">time flies like an arrow</a>.

Plus, when letting them do the work there is a risk that they don't focus on the right thing -- because yes, they come with their own set of glasses, with their domain of expertise that do not necessarily fit ours a 100% percent ... and well, OpenCare is quite a unique \"assemblage\" of people, isn't it?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-07 05:03:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.389911", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 350, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25553], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57307, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10408, "post_number": 2, "raw": "cze\u015b\u0107 Samuel!

I guess I inadvertedly did that change when looking up the group fields, though I don't remember.\n\nThis shows the downside of Drupal's gazillion options: you can't remember them all :D A similar funny story happened a few days ago: the main body field on edgeryders.eu was not showing any more, and I had no idea why. So I even had to create a script that overwrites the Drupal database (of a testing site) with values from a backup, table by table and then record by record, until I found the single \"1\" where a \"0\" was needed to display the body field again. Turns out I had forgotten about enabling\u00a0 a certain module, and the default permissions of that module where such that they broke the site (see my <a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/2019919\">bug report about it</a>).\n\n<div style=\"position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;\">I originally wanted to post this comment within a dev group, but I didn't have default permissions to do that, - See more at: https://edgeryders.eu/blog/edgeryders-website-overhaul#comment-1198</div>", "created_at": "2013-06-17 23:57:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.375086", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24273], "is_liked_by": [115], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66085, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11954, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Nice to meet you, @TamaraVuk!

But to shift the focus of the unMonastery to one project - that would follow necessarily from its financial support - I think would be similarly, if not more, detrimental to unMonastery participants and to the great range of identified challenges we aim to address.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-13 09:37:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.676960", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 267, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47189, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 9009, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@amelia thank you for this :slight_smile:\nIt will take a bit to digest it entirely (and to have a look at the proposed literature).\n\nI will get back on this in a few days.", "created_at": "2018-09-09 07:00:44.570191", "updated_at": "2018-09-09 07:00:44.570191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24644, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2715, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Communication</b>\n\nOkay this feels a lot like people talking past each other, which is damaging for everyone involved - but seems to have become common practice of late at the unMonastery.\n\n<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a> I think you're misreading what people are expressing in terms of suprise about this post, actually this kind of transparency is most likely welcomed. Where the frustration falls, is in the fact that <a href=\"/u/fortyfoxes\">@fortyfoxes</a> was asked to be transparent about his intentions and plans, a week ago (and also 3 weeks prior to that by myself and Nadia). Everyone is still waiting on his response to both of those meetings we've had, and the frustration is centred here because you've been put in the position where you're the one reporting back for David. This is where the flares of tension are coming from.\n\nI agree that anything happening at the Meta-Level needs to be communicated on EdgeRyders, since this is the stakeholder dynamics and the way the project should function - so at each turn that we've taken at this level I've tried to report it online in posts. However the interpersonal dynamics taking place in the building are better resolved offline, otherwise we waste an enormous amount of time and energy debating online.\n\nIn terms of accountability to the broader EdgeRyders network, since that meeting with <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a> we have consistently produced a Friday public review, primarily intended for online consumption. Were this producing a dialogue online, more would likely be reported. It's also worth noting for the record that a mistake was made at the beginning of the project (perhaps by me) in that it was never stated explicitly that people post on EdgeRyders - given the disquiet, it's obviously not something to be repeated. It was though something that was lost in the infrastructural nightmare of the first month, particularly the severely flakey/no internet.\n\nIn terms of contribution to the success and potential continuation of the project, individual reports will be going online this week coming from each project and I hope that this will go some way to giving recognition to those who have put an enormous amount of energy into making things work.\n\nOn a side note, unMonastery wasn't supposed to be a burnout inducing project but it's now starting to feel that way more and more by the hour.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-13 18:20:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.486359", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1633], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74090, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 13174, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hmmm no, no garden here.

This will make you a natural part of the social setting.\n\n![image|690x503,75%](upload://rxeSOtlqkES74SCRnb06yV9BCRv.jpeg) \n\n\nThe ability is the second factor: Your offering needs to remove an obstacle to what people want. It needs to save people time, money, or offer the possibility to do a totally new thing. Something that the client didn't know that they want because they didn't know it exists. \n\nAfterward, you need to figure out how your offering can solve all of their needs.\nGet the bigger picture, figure out what pieces are needed and where you can find them. Even if you cannot offer everything to them, don't worry about it - you figure out how you can work with others to make a package deal that meets the clients' needs. Make sure you know you can add those things later, and we could build them exactly as the clients want them.\n\nIt would be best if you brake down the price of the offering into small segments. To do so, you need to think about your production process so that you only start with what you have without incurring additional costs. \n\n\n![image|690x263,75%](upload://xJllcoEwtyIv8GegkMjmSkjvBXV.png) \n\nThis means you need to get creative in looking around you to see what resources you already have, and then packaging them to sell as a low-cost/low-risk offer. \n\t\t\nAfterwards, Nadia shared the offline tasks ([Offline Task 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GwQoxDKsD-KXOWYTDurz4jjdmbrZKqnHJaCIRCj29-o/edit) & [Offline Task2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAZ1R_3TRuvz2gI9gyUgnHMsMRjZ_2mBGxvUGCcsWcY/edit) )\n\nAt the end of the Webinar @khouloud.ouesleti  facilitated a Q&A question\n\n[date=2020-01-28 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]", "created_at": "2020-01-28 22:39:08.396760", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:21:52.888636", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 239.2, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 6114, 3703, 6116, 5804, 6132, 6321], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71210, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9511, "post_number": 60, "raw": "We are published!!!! \n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1525822X20908236", "created_at": "2020-03-12 09:35:13.771849", "updated_at": "2020-03-12 09:35:13.771849", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 56.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [70390], "is_liked_by": [4096, 4022, 6183], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74594, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 13226, "post_number": 16, "raw": "\"The European Commission, in close collaboration with the EU member states, will host a pan-European hackathon to connect civil society, innovators, partners and investors across Europe in order to develop innovative solutions for coronavirus-related challenges.\"\n\n24-26/4 \n\nThe challenges include: \n\n- health & life\n- business continuity\n- remote working & education\n- social & political cohesion\n- digital finance\n-  open category\n\nAll info here: \nhttps://euvsvirus.org/?fbclid=IwAR1-OKe8PbxWFvczEIeLL38Cnjcivjt_HKpgO7qG6J-LyIF1UDUoKYAcH7M", "created_at": "2020-04-14 11:33:35", "updated_at": "2020-04-19 13:25:54.383508", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 67, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34075, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6643, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yay, I'm a big fan of city games :-) we dabbled in it ourselves in our city of Ghent a few years ago with a cat-and-mouse style Vampire Hunting city game.\n\nThere is another session that we're planning to be somewhere in the city: @albertorey 's [fly fishing demo](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-complexities-of-water-investigating-clean-water-for-community/6396).

The communitarian response is there and localisation (even at risk of becoming localism) also, and there is potential for further development. In my view, the big question for every food manager is: how much prices will be important in purchase behaviours during the economic crisis?\n\nThe Italian food retail in general marked increases of around 10% up to the first half of April 2020, with peaks of 30% for packaged goods. But small retail outlets, discount stores and supermarkets made double-digit progress. So-called hypermarkets, which already were in a structural crisis, suffered further marginalization. Italians made greater use of neighborhood shops and small markets compared to pre-Covid. The reduction in the frequency of spending corresponded to a preference towards points of sale close to home, especially those that have introduced services such as click & collect, telephone orders, via WhatsApp or via the website (16% of families benefited from food delivery). Take into account that before the pandemics Italian consumers were not enthusiastic online food buyers. According to a recent survey, 60% said that the origin of food - already relevant in the past - will be even more important after the Covid. This is tricky because it might have 'gastro-nationalistic' outcomes (see the proposed law in Czech Republic to push supermarkets to sell 55% of 'national' food). 45% said that short supply chains will be more important. It has to be seen how these new trends will match with the attention to convenience and price, given a difficult economic outlook, which will likely determine a sharp reduction in income and spending capacity. \n\nHope this helps.", "created_at": "2020-06-03 07:47:17.940584", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 07:47:17.940584", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 312, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 63.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77453], "is_liked_by": [3, 3293, 4934, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9883, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6123, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>So what started as a mockup anti establishment party..</b>\n\nended as a real thing aka\u00a0misery of politics? it's not clear how much was a premeditated experiment and where it went beyond it. the danger with exotic, eccentric figures turned real politicians\u00a0is IMO\u00a0when they start to believe\u00a0that\u00a0they're called for by the public, that they are sorely needed as saviors.

For me it's about getting lots of minds into a room and hacking through a series of ideas. It's really useful to have the knowledge from attending ER events around HackPads and shared note taking etc. More hints and tips of ways to get maximum participation and collective intelligence out of event like this would be helpful though.\n\nWe've attended panel discussions in the UK about refugee support and the end feeling is always a very negative one, the focus is so often on what cannot be achieved. We want to end on an optimistic note, to send people out realising that there are small things they can do in their own communities that will make a big positive impact on the lives of others.\n\nFor me there are a number of possible positive outcomes:\n\n1. We connect the attendees of the event together, bringing new support and volunteers to organisations in the UK (and further afield), creating the opportunity for collaboration and skills sharing in the future.\n\n2. We do some 'blue sky' thinking around refugee and community cohesion. Thinking up ways that citizen led projects\u00a0could help build services in the UK to better serve the needs of both refugees and their local communities. This could bring in case studies from ER community members around Europe.\n\n3. We set out to solve a problem that the people who are likely to attend could help solve. The number one target on my list is: How can we change the prevaling narrative about refugees in the UK? As\u00a0part of this has to do with the stories we tell about them, and who tells them, it fits really nicely into the other work that we are producing at the festival as well.\n\nWe've commissioned and are producing 6 pieces of performance art/theatre each one based on the data and statistics in one of the 6\u00a0Refugee Rights Reports about Calais. (http://refugeerights.org.uk/reports/) The idea in the words of my collaborator and 'boss' Katharine is \"<i>: the\u00a0<b>Refugee Rights Data Project</b>\u00a0collect data directly from the refugees in the camps of northern France. \u00a0Their reports are filled with facts (not fury or romanticism, facts).\u00a0</i><em>In a series of five stripped-back performances, Crew for Calais artists use music, theatre and the Refugee Rights Data Project reports to connect us with the day-to-day experiences of the refugees in Calais and beyond.\"</em>\n\nI don't expect that we can achieve all 3 objectives i outlined above in a short space of time. But if we can manage to do either 2 or 3 then i think 1 will start to happen automatically. I think right now (as i'm planning this in my head) I would try to bookend bits of 3 around 2 so that people can be drawn into the discussion by looking at positive case studies, then launch into a session dealing with a specific question, and then at the end bring it back to some other case studies so that people go away feeling empowered.\n\nI see that this\u00a0could be an opportunity to reach out to refugee support services that run in the UK and get them to feed their stories of 'caring for people on the move' into the OpenCare structure as well. I know that this part of the process will be 'over' by February but it can't help to keep feeding interesting cases into the network.\n\nEnough waffle for now.

Dinner is a special time, we all gather experiencing different tastes and point of views coming from different cultures.  \n\n\n##Still looking for a system\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7dbe0f42c11642dcf073ecf1c64bbb72cf8e3cd9.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"264\">\n<small> Left: preparing a movie screening on the rooftop during the full moon, Right: Starting a fire by the beach during our collective dinner/discussion. </small> \n\nWe believe that the highlight of the month could be summed up in \u201c LOOKING FOR A SYSTEM\u201d in between finding better efficient productive workflow to getting used to actually living together and knowing each other, building our personal relationships, and getting everything up and running from cooking, cleaning, washing the dishes, fixing the bicycle, getting water, bread, groceries, and tools. \n\nDefinitely not an easy straightforward task to have. We had our share of misunderstandings, and frustration. In order to pass through this we had 2 collective discussions where everyone shared their feelings, expectations, questions, and thoughts. One of them was around a fire by the beach ( location sometimes helps ). By the end of the month things socially became smoother, work still needs to be more productive, but it is advancing slowly though. \n\n>@imake _\"I have been liking the experience and the mix of people and nature so far. The part that is missing for me, the productivity people seem not committed about the work they are doing, but the why is missing ?_\n_why are you guys making this, I would like to know, and also for the projects, still didn't get the whole idea of the openvillage and I think this is missing and this makes it not clear for me\"_\n\n>@islem _\u201cWe need to find a balance between working and doing some activities, and the balance and between our own projects and what we do alone in our countries and what we are sharing with other people.\u201d_\n\n\nDuring the 2 collective discussions we touched upon different topics, passing by the usual organizational topic of [distribution of tasks](https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-living-together-doing-the-dishes-and-dunbar-ish-numbers-the-sidi-kaouki-chronicles/8068/7?u=hazem), and what exactly is the [openvillage vision](https://edgeryders.eu/t/proposal-for-a-network-of-openvillage-houses/6785)  and why and how is this happening, to acknowledging our cultural differences so not to judge others and to have a more freely open environment, to why are we not advancing as productive as we wanted to in the projects that we are doing, and how to find balance in between our own personal projects and studies, the actual project in hand, and getting everything to work on the house.\n\n\nThese collective discussions helped us in acknowledging our status quo and how to move forward and have a smoother coliving environment. \n\n\n##Social interactions / Coliving\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/63cea0b6f44f8dc15dd886b87686076083ece874.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"264\">\n<small> Left : Dinner time, Right: First aid session conducted by @HadeerGhareeb </small>\n \nOf course during the past month, we encountered lots of social interactions in between the Tunisian Egyptian Palestinian youth, sharing food, experiences, love stories, normal ice breakers as people are getting to know each other.\n\nThe more the number is increasing the more the interaction getting complex. Since the first day people seems like they are getting along together so well, supporting each others in their personal goals (quit smoking, speaking English \u2026). Some are proposing ways of knowing each more, telling stories, sharing answers on the same question, proposing movie nights. \n\nFor some the coliving is a new experience that they still not familiar with making them uncomfortable sometimes sharing life with people coming from different cultural background. Questions regarding the concept started to be arouse what led to many discussions including the 2 collective discussions mentioned above. \n\nNormally, some side fun activities emerged in the house, some mad people went swimming even if the weather is not that swimming friendly, practicing yoga on the beach, running, watching films, playing card games, telling stories by night, night walks, early morning walks as well\u2026.. \n\nEveryone is coming with a lot of enthusiasm for the project and the experience. But collectively we are taking our time to find \u201cequilibrium\u201d. \n\n\n##Work flow\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/df0bea42638fc3911472fd225e8c1bd69be1c1f8.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"264\">\n<small> Left: Bitcut team introductory discussion, Right: Coffee sorter team introductory discussion. </small> \n\nAs mentioned, work is still not as productive as expected. we believe this is due different reasons; we took some time to adapt to the living conditions and this was affecting the work environment as well, some of the productive time is lost in doing the overhead tasks required to make everything up and running, not enough fresh input from out of the house, besides with the windy weather we have one big indoor space for working and living. \n\nThat being said, you can follow the development done in the bitcut project [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-village-bitcut-house-sidi-kaouki/8145) where the team decided to design their first prototype for the local school in Sidi Kaouki. The process is done in cooperation with a local initiative in Kaouki where they discussed some of the local needs and the school was focal point of these discussions.\n\nFor the Coffee sorter machine, you can check the first machine design [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coffee-sorter-machine-design-version-1-0/8086/10) the computer model for the mechanical part is almost done and the camera is being trained to detect the quality of beans soon. \n\nBoth projects are already gathering online attention attracting interested people, weather coffee farmers or people interested in design and architecture. \n\nby the end of the period we would probably end up with initial prototypes for both projects, Still the business development for both needs to be done concretely in the coming stages. \n\non the side people started to discuss their own projects in small discussions, collectively we had only 2 night sessions with an introduction to machine learning done by @imake which was extremely interesting even for non-programmers, and a needed first aid session by @HadeerGhareeb, some other sessions are still pending where everyone can talk about his/her own ideas and projects so we can learn from each other and help each other develop our own projects.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9e77aadd1b6f209349a71820c7f508cb5ab326c4.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"447\">\n<small> Left: Bitcut's first designed prototype for the school, Right: @AhmedMajdoub working on the coffee sorter machine design. </small>  \n\n##Connection with the school and local kaouki initiative\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8bfdb073736740b801827bcddec02410e84249d7.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"264\">\n\n\n\nOn 16.02, @HadeerGhareeb went to the school, she had the opportunity to meet some girls on their way already to the school. They talked about the difficulty of reaching the school as it is far from their houses and the way is not smooth enough. They go now by bicycles that were donated by an association from Casablanca. Reaching the school that also was painted recently by the same association. The school has two class rooms and two teachers. Each room has two different levels accommodating around 40 students. Hadeer has the chance to give a small presentation to the kids about her \u201c[Trash Into Toys](https://edgeryders.eu/t/your-toys-out-of-trash-arabic-english/6687)\u201d workshops and she showed them some pictures of previous workshops. In her way back she met a family and they invited her for tea and they created a kind of bond. Hadeer came back from this journey loaded with feelings that she wanted to diffuse with the group.\n\nSubsequently, @hazem  and @HadeerGhareeb  went to speak with Mohamed Mady, A community leader in Sidi Kaouki to agree on collaborative initiatives (Trash into Toys workshop/Upcycled Playground) for the school. This will be done after an official letter to the association.\n\nMoreover, increasing the bond with the village @Komitas  and @HadeerGhareeb  went to the village and they made a workshop, introducing juggling and making clubs from trash. Since they still need a permission from the government, there approach was to go to the village talk with the families and take the family permission to interact with the kids directly. The first house they encountered, Hadeer didn't need much to convince the family about the workshops they immediately agreed to host them and the kids in their house. Then, we continued walking to get more kids we ended up with around 12-14 kid their age ranging from 7 - 15 years old. \n\n##Hosting @Komitas \n\nWe got connect to @Komitas , as a friend of @iriedawta , who was traveling around in Morocco at the time, so we hosted him for a few days and he was bringing nice energy to the house helping in every aspect. Naturally he found his place with @HadeerGhareeb  conducting some workshops for the school kids.  ( read about his own experience  [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/working-with-the-children-of-sidi-kaouki/8243/11) ) \n\n##What's next ?\n\nWe passed an intense month, now looking ahead to host the surfboards project, continue working on bitcut and the coffee sorter producing the prototypes and draft business plans, draft plans for other projects in house like @islem's and @Sofien-Dahem's ones ( will be online soon ).\n@hazem and @HadeerGhareeb started to record a video/audio series with the participants, Now @alex_levene is in house with more experience in this. \nWe are having some fresh faces and people leaving as well, Noha had to leave due to some family emergency in Egypt, then @m_tantawy and @mmajdeb as well, @natalia_skoczylas , @Ceylan and @alex_levene arrived. still some other participants will join us in the coming 2 months and as always you never know how things will develop with such a mix of people in one place. \n\n---\nWritten by @HadeerGhareeb and @hazem", "created_at": "2018-03-11 13:19:56.074629", "updated_at": "2018-03-22 06:06:22.230607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2009, "wiki": false, "reads": 43, "score": 738.6, "like_count": 16, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 3782, 4, 3703, 5, 4041, 3811, 4265, 4366, 3622, 4286, 3729, 3, 3791, 4085, 2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78793, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13861, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@nadia [here is the best](https://live.edgeryders.eu/13861) I could do with arranging text and photos, I don't know enough for making it prettier.  @owen can you help out?

I've seen young people making sacrifices to be there and heavily lobbying to their supervisors to get a job afterwards, because they actually didn't have any other opportunities and resource afterwards.. graduates who didn't plan to go back to their country where apparently they had limited opportunities, but didn't know where they were going to live when the internship would be over.So for such people it is indeed a huuge investment, it really is the unique chance to start a career.\n\nBut on the other hand I've met rich young people who were at their n-th such experience - some had been just returning from another of pretty much the same type only to apply to the next.. and continue their collection. asking around why organizations would even take them if they already did similar jobs, I got what IMO is an appaling answer: because orgs actually get a better deal picking people who already have experience interning. Which is serious because we're talking of \"professional interns\", and this contradicts the so-called goal of offering internships, to give a \u00a0career start and a chance to accumulate working experience, when there is none. Then you could say, from the orgs point of view, that this justifies not paying for work, or that it might be a win-win situation (of course hardly because for the less priviledged this is a no win from the start). \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut perpetuating this idea of a career in internships is really vicious, beyond my understanding. What can we do to change things? I've seen there's a lot of buzz already online, which makes me think the situation can't last for too long and things should change, but I'm not sure if legal initiatives have been created, do you know of any, Ildim?\n\nIn my university, in social sciences dpts, doing an unpaid internship can get you credits and it's sometimes compulsory - they even enroll you in a programme, so there's no unfair competition involved. But then you don't intern for the big guys, and the experience is not likely to constitute a jump start in your career..\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-17 20:45:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.092604", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 449, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86150, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14733, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Saw them many years ago in North Carolina.

Also, how do we make us think about retirement when we're young and busy with making ends meet - this is such a scary and distant prospect! With the project we're trying to make people imagine it a bit earlier on, also because we believe such imagination is key to empowerment and ability to create futures we like, in general. And the ability to imagine the life we want to lead in a rapidly changing socio-economical landscape will be key to finding strategies for the post-work world we're hopefully going to enter - because what retirement should be, according to its description, is a meaningful life in which money should not be limiting anymore. This is what I imagine us like when robots take over the boring tasks... :) \n\nThank you, @juneholley, for sharing your experience and ideas - very valuable!", "created_at": "2019-11-18 13:45:28.540504", "updated_at": "2019-11-18 13:45:28.540504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 302, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63145, "user_id": 5275, "topic_id": 11367, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi Nadia,\n\nI will only have the stories during the event.

Putting faces on names, and names into places can help to put some flesh in the process, which is always welcome. Hence, one question arises, one I am very much concerned about - as you have all learnt to know, by now! The unMon - Matera interface: [andrea paoletti] is in position... although I was wondering starting from when? I know that he has a contract for co-designing the space in the Sassi, so I was wondering if as \"interface\" this also meant the lin with the local community, the enterprises and the institutions. If so, I would very much like to team up with him since in the organization of the LOTE I have heated up personal contacts which are ready to join and participate, based on trust. We all know how much trust is difficult to build, and easy to loose. Thing is, I would really cherish to follow the unMon, and want to understand to which extent I can, as I am ready to take some personal choices in order to be in Matera. I probably missed some pieces, so I don't know what Andrea has been doing for the community building: it is important not to duplicate or overlap, as we don't want to harrass the locals, do we :-) So yeah, I guess I just would love to make things a bit clearer in my head, in order to channel the right energy related to a clear deal and not make any confusion!\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>I'll see all of you tomorrow, in any case!

Dragan Djilas, so called entrepreneur but in fact a guy who shames that profession for me and everyone else truly living it. I will not go into details about him, you could write a book about all the ways in which he wasted and stole public money.\n2. \"He never clearly said what will he do, we are sick of talk\". Opposition often focuses on why leader is bad, not what good will they bring. For example when I followed Vuk Jeremic candidature two years back, I did it because some common friends we have told me he is a serious candidate and that I should pay attention. I watched few of his speeches and quickly decided he is not going to get anywhere simply because he kept trying to trash current government but I heard no solutions. I decided I wouldn't support him either (I am not citizen of Serbia anyways but I wouldn't support him through other means).\n3. Opposition fractured because some of it is fake (created for the purpose of taking votes from real opposition)\n4. \"But things are happening, we are rebuilding\". That part is true and is visible around Serbia. The thing is, previous governments were often so bad that when you compare the current one with them-the current one wins. The bar is set very low.\n\nReal opposition gets minimum media exposure and the small bits they get are often just to attempt to provoke them and not really let them speak about their program (very little freedom of media, people are bombarded with all the amazing stuff about their government every day and all the other manipulation strategies like playing the enemy card, from within or from outside of the country).\nAlso the current government stole so much money already and created such a system that they can buy 50% of the votes for sure, even without all the positive things people see in it or are manipulated into seeing.", "created_at": "2019-12-01 09:31:35.959656", "updated_at": "2019-12-01 09:31:35.959656", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 377, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 52.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66485], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60001, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10886, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Zdravo Igor, dobrodo\u0161li u urednike !!

This is one reason I'll be working to assemble the Reality Guides to function as curators of the platform and facilitators of the people doing the work. \n\nBut perhaps an easy way to visualize the information users need to work could be to create dashboards that contextualize the information contained in the graph around a given node. \n\nWhat I'm thinking are web pages generated by making queries to the database and parsing them into natural language.

Less the 1000 EUR I can commit from H2020 budget (as we'll re-use the functionality on the NGI Forward platform), you'll have to find \u22643000 EUR from your project budget or similar.\n\nWe can't start working on this before 2019-07-01 due to current deadlines for other projects, so you have until then at least to confirm the budget.\n\nAlso to note, that budget is for the tech development based on your technical requirements. If you want a sophisticated design or UX, that would be in addition and you'd have to manage that part of the process (get that designed by somebody and handed to us when we start with the work).", "created_at": "2019-06-17 19:26:35.407727", "updated_at": "2019-06-17 19:26:35.407727", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 424, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [55208], "is_reply_to": [55208], "is_liked_by": [137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66887, "user_id": 5676, "topic_id": 12080, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Pozdrav, Tatjana!\nMi radimo \u010desto scenografije, za festivale, predstave, dekoraciju za koncerte i sl.

Among them, desks and office chairs; construction materials; empty bottles and cans; and conference materials, like flyers and posters. The complex hosted, for most of 2014, the world's first [unMonastery](http://unmonastery.org/), a hacker residency project tied to the city's victorious bid for the title of European capital of culture in 2019. The reporter decided this was an \"affair\": the unMonastery affair. Foreigners come to Matera to dump their garbage! Shame on them! This reverberated on some unpleasant social media interactions between some Materani and some unMonasterians and edgeryders, like @elf_Pavlik (see [here](/t/materatown-asks-about-some-waste-controversy/4055)).\n\nI am a partner and co-director of Edgeryders, the social enterprise that helped mount the Matera unMonastery iteration. I know the project well, and I know the unMonasterians who were its life and soul. None would dream of just abandoning waste in an unappropriate place, and some are extreme recyclers and upcyclers. So I asked around, and, sure enough, it turned out that the room in question ([highlighted in red](/uploads/default/original/2X/3/39d32ae21dd11a3fee8d518e170c76ead31fdd7d.jpg)) had been used as cellar since before we first inspected the complex in 2013 (see [these pictures](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/erqqhxwkt5qhdcd/AADOIqB3374nwJBoPu5a_mvIa?dl=0%20) \u2013 the Dropbox timestamps show they have not been edited in over a year). It is likely that the derelict office furniture has been abandoned by the former occupant of the complex, a company called DataContact. With appropriate irony, DataContact's owner also owns the local TV that mounted the \"affair\".\n\nDuring our tenure of the small part of the complex used for the unMonastery, the same room kept being used as a sort of cellar: a storage space for objects unMonasterians could not or would not recycle, generally with a view to later upcycling them. Like many cellars, it looks untidy, but that is hardly newsworthy. On the side, it is worth noting that the unMonastery project devoted over 50% of its budget  (about 40K EUR) to renovating that part of the Casale complex, owned by the City of Matera and hence public property. This meant installing a kitchen; repairing the heating system; renovating the floors, damaged by humidity in the bottom floors; whitewashing the walls; reclaiming the space from some people who were occupying it illegally. The space was returned to the city in way better conditions than we found it. What probably happened: somebody broke the door's lock before the reporter wandered in, and that allowed him his \"scoop\". Case closed.\n\nOr is it? There is a lesson to learn here. Why did  the obvious scenario (\"a windowless room at the bottom floor with junk in it? Must be the cellar\") escaped the local reporter? Why did he not check? Talking with some Materan friends, we made (partly for a laugh), three hypotheses.\n\n* **The absent-minded journalist**. Local media need local news, and \"foreign hackers pollute Matera\" is way sexier than \"a cellar containing nothing of value is broken into\". Especially if you are selling ads to make a living, and therefore counting your page views is important.\n\n* **The political conspiracy**: Matera has local elections coming up in the spring. The incumbent mayor is associated with the European capital of culture candidacy. The \"unMonastery affair\" is an attempt to erode the consensus enjoyed by the current administration in the aftermath of the ECOC victory.\n\n* **The nil-nil draw syndrome**: Italians, according to my wise friend Annibale D'Elia, \"do not really care about winning, as long as your adversaries do not win either\". In this culture, nil-nil is not a bad result; in fact it is desirable, because it allows the people in question to stage a fight without really fighting, to \"change things so that things can stay as they are\", as in the supremely Italian novel [The Leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard).\n\nIn the end, it is of no consequence why some local reporter decided to go for the \"unMonastery affair\". What does matter, for this iteration of the unMonastery as well as future ones, is this: **the unMonastery wields considerable moral and intellectual authority**. We might not want them, but we do not really get a vote in the matter. The smaller and more provincial the host city, the more prominent the unMonastery and individual unMonasterians will be in the public eye. There will be awe; there will be jealousy; whatever its sign, there will be exaggeration. These things will simply happen; it would be wise to be ready for them. From a stewardship point of view, it would be good practice to take time-stamped photo- and video documentation of any public resource the unMonastery is entrusted with.\n\nI submit underestimation of the unMonastery's public profile to @Bembo_Davies and @katalin for inclusion in the Book of Mistakes.

(That was all I know about calendars now.)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-05 20:34:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.596715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 214, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6970], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66968, "user_id": 6078, "topic_id": 12115, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![dsqd%20(1)|690x578](upload://z99QSXtUCPVHxOsMw5SdF9REnbZ.png) \n\n**What is OCI Lab?**\n\nOCI Lab brings social and green aspiring entrepreneurs from Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, and Jordan) together with mentors from all over the globe to their idea and reach their full potential.

They declined: they said they needed the building's upper floor (where the living quarters of the unMonasterians used to be) to move their own offices to. But then the plan must have changed, because they clearly did not move their offices there, and this left the building unmanned and unprotected.\n\nI was really saddened by these news. But they do contain a valuable lesson: <em>stewardship is about the long haul.</em> If you accept stewardship for an asset, you should be prepared to do it for a long time, ideally indefinitely. This also means that the logic of projects \u2013 that by definition have a beginning at an end \u2013 is at odds with that of stewardship. In practice, it will be inevitable \u2013 and even desirable \u2013 to merge stewardship initiatives with projects, and indeed the two can support each other; but it is important to keep your eyes on the long-term stewardship horizon. Now I will be forced to say \"we can't be held responsible for what happened in the unMonastery building \u2013 we took good care of it as long as we were in town, and in fact we promised four months of occupancy and ended up being there for nine!\". And it will be true, but it is also deeply wrong, and I do not like to have to say it. What I <em>would</em> like to say is \"hell, we are moving back in until the city can engineer another stewardship arrangement\".\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-14 11:36:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.162178", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 285, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26502], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54083, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9078, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Right: Payment, not Refund", "created_at": "2019-05-28 13:44:28.529541", "updated_at": "2019-05-28 13:44:28.529541", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54059], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56424, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10320, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@johncoate here's the text, but I dont know how to turn it into a wiki :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-07-09 15:59:57.206771", "updated_at": "2019-07-09 15:59:57.206771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80285, "user_id": 6527, "topic_id": 14032, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<!---I consent to this being published in my name/ on my behalf--->", "created_at": "2020-07-13 07:40:30.010161", "updated_at": "2020-07-15 13:17:01.781449", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54217, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10031, "post_number": 6, "raw": "well, unfortunate in the sense that we don't have salons (yet?!) on IoT by Rob ;)", "created_at": "2019-05-30 12:37:02.831257", "updated_at": "2019-05-30 12:37:02.831257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 18.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54215], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62052, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11233, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Tamara, I think we are good with the speakers and can focus on creating stories with them and others who are signing up.

If we find that it's attractive for more upstarting co-working spaces and communal spaces in the MENA region, we might want to bake this into the next project funding proposal that @nadia is working on.\n\nI agree that it's risky as an alternative to existing co-living models. I had primarily co-working models and other non-residential communal spaces in mind though (didn't write that clearly). Of these, there are many more, and they can add guestrooms or living quarters without making that their focus.\n\n[quote=\"Yosser, post:3, topic:6785\"]having women in rural areas to have a job in the space where they make an artisanal crafts and help them with selling them, so maybe also we can have such a thing in the platform where they can display their crafts[/quote]\n\nThat's a great idea \u2013 I'll add it above! Because, online sales to European consumers enables your artisans to get a higher price, when compared to both local sales and sales via wholesalers. (Market prices in Europe are higher, and by having an online marketplace for direct sales this higher margin is not captured by intermediate traders but can go to those manufacturing the products.)\n\nWe tried something similar here at Edgeryders by [importing coffee beans from a village in Nepal](/t/id/6056/9) and offering it on an associated online marketplace for direct sales ([epelia.com](https://epelia.com/)), which a friend of mine founded. The farmers would get approximately double the normal price, while our sales prices in Europe are still average. And managing European Union customs is definitely doable (it's a little nightmare the first time, but we got the coffee through in the end). Manuals and instructions for handling this can be part of the knowledge base as well.\n\nThe big problem with this approach is however, nothing sells online in Europe if you don't actively market it. When Europeans do that marketing, a big part of the sales price will have to stay with them due to the higher price and wage level in Europe. I think the only solution to that is a collaboration where most of the marketing effort is done locally in the country where manufacturing happens, and only tasks that require knowledge of the European target market would be done inside Europe.", "created_at": "2017-08-25 09:24:43.044098", "updated_at": "2017-08-25 09:24:43.044098", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 421, "wiki": false, "reads": 42, "score": 28.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [34695, 34702], "is_reply_to": [34695, 34702], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74257, "user_id": 6414, "topic_id": 13198, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey everyone.

It has been launched with funding from the Swedish arts council fund Kulturbryggan to create open source software for participatory culture, and that's what we'll deliver in 2019. For those unfamiliar with the term, participatory culture includes events like [The Borderland](http://theborderland.se/) and [Burning Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man), immersive productions like [Unknown 9](https://unknown9.com/) and [You Me Bum Bum Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Me_Bum_Bum_Train), live action role playing events like [Blodsband Reloaded](https://www.bbreloaded.se/) or games by @matteo_uguzzoni and [Urban Games Factory](http://www.urbangames-factory.it/en/about-en/).\n\nMethods and software that fit the needs of fringe participatory culture today might very well be key pieces in future mainstream paradigms for a wide range of organizations. I make this prediction because these project are often immensely complex, produced on a relatively small budget by volunteers that can number in the hundreds or even thousands. Decisions are often made by a wide variety of participants asking for advice rather than permission, and the operations are based on trust rather than mandate by hierarchy. Organizations working in the participatory culture field are particularly interesting because they are well fitted to decentralized organizational structures. Decentralized decision making and co-creation is still in it's early stages, but these concepts are hailed as the future paradigm by many. It's likely that it will be increasingly popular in the mainstream world to organize in this swarm-like fashion. \n\nOver the last few years working with the Borderland, we've found that deploying the right technological tools and methods at the right time can give big boosts to a participatory community and ease scaling of the organization and it's projects. However, most tools that exist have been built with tech development projects in mind. A large reason for this is this that this is the market that the people building the tools understand, but also because this is a field that has been flooded with money in recent decades. It's these companies and projects that have brought us technologies like revision control through Git, task management through Scrum methods and tools like Trello and Jira. However, tools for collaborative tech development are often a bit clumsy when used for other classes of projects.\n\nAt the Borderland, uptake of the Dreams platform had much to do that it had been designed exactly with that community in mind. This did require us to build things from scratch, though many design principles were inspired by existing technology. Dreams was inspired by services like Kickstarter. Realities is inspired by the task management cards and role assignment of Trello, the dependency terminology of Gantt charts and the graph data visualization of Kumu. In both cases, we've used language and concepts at the heart of the Borderland culture, rather than to force the Borderland to fit some predefined technical jargon. As a result, the Borderland is probably one of the most technically advanced participatory culture communities in the world.\n\nSo what's the challenge? Creating software takes a lot of time, effort and specialized skills. And paying in full for custom software development for participatory culture organizations is out of the question, it would be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the job market for software developers is such today that it's hard to motivate people to work for hours on an untested experiment. Most developers already have plenty of paid work and would like to spend their free away from the screen. However, paid meaningful and experimental work is rare, so many developers are willing to put in the hours for a fun project if they can just make ends meet. \n\nThis is the gap that Participio wants to bridge. We want to raise a pot of funding every year, find these paradigm-shifting challenges, and produce experimental but usable software to fit a specific case as a proof of concept. We will start with the arts and culture field in 2019 but move to other fields later. We will develop with an emphasis on fast iterations, and just enough polish to test the method and technology. We will document every step of the way, and make our code, documentation and research findings open source and freely available.\n\nTo reflect this, I've come up with a mission statement.\n\n> ## Edgeryders Participio Development Lab\n\n> Participio is a development lab within Edgeryders. Our purpose is to build experimental software and methodology for decentralized organizations and co-created culture. Everything built by Participio is open-source and free to use. \n\n> We explore what is ahead of the current paradigm. Our experiments might only fit 0.1% of all organizations today, but might fit 1% in a few years and 10% in a decade. We develop practical and groundbreaking software for real projects and organizations, but don't build finished products or deliver packaged solutions. \n\n> Developers, researchers, artists and designers working on Participio projects coordinate their work on this platform. Feel free to make a post about your idea for Participio, or to get in touch with a developer who can help you get one of the tools we've developed up and running for your organization\n\nBased on this, Participio has two goals for 2019. Our first goal is to deliver our first batch of experiments, research and documentation. We already know that the key client for these experiments is The Borderland and that we will do some work on Dreams and Realities. Our second goal is to raise funding for 2020 and define our future challenges.\n\nWe also know that Participio will have a physical home. Edgeryders is moving into the Blivande House in Stockholm in January, and those working on Participio and other Edgeryders projects will have a place at a desk there while they do so.\n\nWhat do you think about this plan? Who should be involved? What challenges should we look at?\n\nI'm starting this conversation here in Campfire so that more people can see it and get involved, and will later move it to the [Participio category](https://edgeryders.eu/c/participio). @alberto, @matthias, @nadia, @anique.yael, please help me tag some people that could be interested.", "created_at": "2018-10-17 00:23:06.720698", "updated_at": "2018-11-02 22:09:55.468360", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1069, "wiki": false, "reads": 87, "score": 1662.4, "like_count": 12, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 4451, 4660, 8, 3, 4691, 1543, 3310, 4861, 5494, 5512], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17491, "user_id": 2099, "topic_id": 3131, "post_number": 5, "raw": "It was going to be my session surprise but...if you insist...to catch more attendance it would be good it i could gift you and others with some of our products and if there is some other attend it would be glad to make some more.\n\nNothing i do(in life in general) for quite along is out what i do at jozour its some how its related if it wasn't directly projected....so what I'll b sessioning will be almost within what i challenging at jozour. and yes i got some factors (pillars) like \\#out of the box is the matter of thinking ....but elements and materials (most of time)some how they are hidden within(beneath us)...and that walk along with making the challenge well defined well put with the local language(well collaboratively understood), which leads solution to have high acceptability(sociologically-culturally) which have a direct positive impact on the sustainability of the project-<strong>project proofing </strong>till convert it as a matter of survival and become a community feature (its one statement....but its life adventure)\n\nI'll check on with the session conversation...and i would definitely glad to attend it\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3abe39f4b6cf6f184bcdc873a7e86f0629f3ceb8.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/608893bb76b4708422bc2c2464840ac50d731383.JPG\" width=\"667\" height=\"400\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-12 12:31:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:37.601723", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 240, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15025], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67561, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12189, "post_number": 8, "raw": "@Emile :  As for the story about Handelsbanken: the key part is that In 1973 they introduced an employee profitsharing scheme.

Please let me know when and how it will suit you to have a call.</span>\n\nAnd you are correct, our first challenge is to collect quality organizations. One strategy that we are implementing is TeachSurfing Wave. With TeachSurfing Wave, we focus on one country for half a year, get targeted fundings for that region, build a team and inform and recruit organizations. Our first Wave is in Armenia. The second strategy which we are testing and would be a great opportunity for collaboration is TeachSurfing Ambassadors. we aim to build a global community of TeachSurfers who take the ambassadorship to inform and/or register their village/city/region schools, non-profits, universities and communities. in return we plan to offer them an international network and training or travelling opportunities.\n\nThe second challenge is exactly what <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0mentioned... encourage the users or maybe even force them to create a complete profile. <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0you just gave me a great idea! if somebody is traveling to Lisbon we can send the organizations and TeachSurfers a reminder to update their profile because a cool TeachSurfer will be around and may visit them! The second idea I have is to separate the users without complete profile from complete ones. They will be excluded from the TeachSurfers search and recommendation letters. We will not hide them completely, we will just separate them from our quality search and recommendation system. because many of the empty profiles are just curious about TeachSurfing but they have no strong motivation to do TeachSurfing. \u00a0\n\nThe third challenge is to track our impact. write now the only way to track our impact is via TeachSurfing stories. The TeachSurfers can submit their experiences and success stories in the platform. One way we are thinking to collect more success matches is to track whom people are writing messages and later we write an email to them and ask for their status and offer them support: (a) did they get reply? (b) do they consider to do TeachSurfing in that organization? (c) is there anything that TeachSurfing team can help them with? This can also be a great point for collaboration. In Edge Ryders you have such a talented community of writers, so if they can help us with writing about their regions TeachSurfing success stories, this content would generate great value and impact for us.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-30 07:48:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.015955", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 557, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48863, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 9203, "post_number": 12, "raw": "An important discussion and thank you for your input and clarifications.

For now I don't have the capacity to rehash what we covered but seeing this conversation is moving it seems important to make one clarification. \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:8, topic:9203\"]\nIn the 2018 campaign, Anique and I took a different strategy. Instead of starting our own consortia, we joined existing ones, proposing everything we do in the concentrated form of one work package. What ended up happening is that we had to \"blend in\" a bit better with other WPs. This is a result of our success at establishing ourselves as a hard-working, dependable, intelligent partner. As the company's \"face\" in those relationship, Anique gets a big part of the credit for that. But that does not mean we do different things: what we do is still going to fall under those six headings, and then the six team leaders are still going to take responsibility for them. Or not: for example, we could have written in the proposal something wildly different, say \"fly fishing expeditions for environmental education\". That does not fall under any of the headings, so we would have had to look for someone else to take on that responsibility (while still in the phase of proposal writing, hopefully).\n[/quote]\n\nIt seems @alberto you and I have very different perspectives on NGI Forward. Acknowledging that you and I worked very closely on the whole 2018 proposal campaign and that our contributions to the proposals were based on your writing, I stewarded our inclusion in NGI Forward. As you know from our conversations along the way, and would have seen when you reviewed the proposal, I extended our work in the project beyond the typical work package model to include us in a number of additional tasks - such as the NGI Visions book which I'd been dialoguing around with the Coordinator almost every consortium call. In addition to a strategic tactic for Edgeryders, this was based on my own background and research interests. Acknowledging certain miscalculations on my part, it seems that one of the challenges we have in this current situation is the blurriness in a number of these tasks. I am not yet sure how to go about resolving this. From the above it seems you are saying that these additional tasks should be taken care of by those team leaders whose work most closely fits. Is that correct?\n\nFor now, may I finish by sharing my ongoing respect to the work of the founders and other collaborators that have got us here. It is unfortunate if it ever comes across differently. Throughout this whole process I have internally and externally acknowledged you, from advocating for the value of this work in the relationship building and proposal writing to honouring your work in posts planning how to scale. I do not think I need to apologise for being a leader in my own right and I think that one of the most significant opportunities Edgeryders has is supporting people to collectively shine. Of course the configurations to do so are not set in stone and I believe we know well how one person's thriving can look very different to another. The key is to find mutual support in doing so. If that means adapting my role I am very open to that, and suggest any further conversations on such a topic be taken to the Company workspace or in real life.", "created_at": "2018-11-22 18:05:40.487998", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 18:05:40.487998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 63.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [48853], "is_reply_to": [48853, 48860], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70094, "user_id": 4463, "topic_id": 12392, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hello Maria, \n\nThanks for getting back to me! \n\nYes that would be great!

I think there is an opportunity here, for papers not likely to be published in mainstream conferences/journals, to make an impact.\n\nSame as you, I would like to get more doers involved. My ideal path to publication would be:\n\n1. Doers inform on what was found to be useful in practice and/or a plausible direction for the sci-fi jump (doers are needed to make it relevant),\n2. Scholars and doers perform the jump together, discuss what they found at destination,\n3. During discussion, a tractable-but-relevant problem appears and gets the paper treatment.\n\nI like the topics you identified. If you keep updating the graph, you can put me under \"Models for organizations and corporate governance\" and \"Computer modeling\".\n\nOh, and I would very much like to have Jean on board for the Org Models topic too :slight_smile: . \n\nHow can I make it happen?

However, is it operational? Some of the items in your list are indeed currencies, although of limited circulation (airline miles), but others seem simply vectors of information (USDA Organic &amp; Fair Trade sticker) and cannot really be redeemed. All of this stuff is information, to be sure, and all currency is information. But not the other way around. Even in your fascinating hominid example there is a false step: signaling when hunting is not the same thing as chanting by the fire because, you know, dancing about architecture is meaningless.\u00a0\n\nComplexity science 101 begins like this: the world is a flux of matter, energy and information. Entities are not really there: they arise by ontological commitment, when I decide a particular mass of suspended H2O molecules is \"that cloud\". The cloud does not really exist in a reductionist sense: it has structure but is blurry at the edges, individual water molecules enter and exit it. It is a pattern, and it makes sense to make an ontological commitment to it because then I can talk about something I care about, for example air traffic.\u00a0\n\nTradeable wealth currencies are a powerful concept. We need it to explain a great many social phenomena. I agree that moving towards a higher level of generalization might yield good intuition.

I'm not too sure yet because it seems that Petri nets are used to describe processes, while our barter graphs represent atomic multi-party transactions (in analogy to financial account movements with the added property that for every account holder the transaction total effect must be zero).\n\nRegarding network barter: There is an introductory description with a small network barter deal graph in our <a href=\"http://www.edgeryders.eu/economy-app/detailed-description\">detailed description PDF document</a> (just scroll through until you find the graph ...).\n\nYou don't see value attached to arrows because it is here attached to the products (square nodes), but this is just a matter of presentation. And price quantization is my name for a <a href=\"http://fiverr.com/\">Fiverr</a> style pricing scheme, where prices can only be multiples of a base price (\"quantum\", in this case 5 EUR). This helps our network barter algorithm to find barter deals because prices can match exactly. However later, we run the algorithm on an order graph with arbitrary prices but allowed a certain mismatch amount (say, 5-10%) of prices via a \"private reserve price\" feature where sellers can enter a hidden, second price that they would agree to sell for at lowest \u2013 and guess what, the algorithm also found large enough deals in this case.\n\nWelcome to ask more questions, to give us feedback on the idea, or to add own ideas if you like :) We're always on the lookout for how to make this type of bartering more flexible, until it becomes hopefully nearly as flexible as money is today ...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-14 23:15:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.128616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 307, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15943], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70226, "user_id": 6183, "topic_id": 12667, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone :raising_hand_man:t4:\n\nThis is my first topic here on the Edge Ryders webspace, so I hope I'm doing it right. My wish is to both introduce myself and open another space for introductions :fire:\n\n---\n\nSo, my name is Danilo and I was born in what is currently known as Brazil. I have spent most of my life in these tropical lands, but I was lucky enough to do quite a lot of traveling, specially while I was a student at a [nomadic college](https://minerva.kgi.edu/). \n\nEducation has literally changed my life. I grew up in a peripheral region of S\u00e3o Paulo and attended the precarious public school system up until high school. At that time, I got a full scholarship in one of the best private schools in the country, which presented me new horizons. From there, I joined S\u00e3o Paulo State University as a Mechanical Engineering student. After two years, I realized that was not what I wanted, so I applied to Minerva (twice) and went on to travel the world as a Social & Computer science major.\n\nIt seems, though, that two years are the maximum I can handle in structured learning programs. So in the fall of 2017 I took a gap year from Minerva to explore a growing passion: Complexity Sciences. That gap was never closed and I didn't return to school.\n\nHowever, I kept on learning (a lot) since then, mostly as an [independent researcher and content creator freelancer](https://dnllvrvz.github.io/). Such a journey has led me to [initiate](https://www.emergir.co/) and [engage](https://daocast.io/) with different types of networks of learners and researchers, as well co-create with them. It took me some time to discover that many people do similar things as I do, and that there's a whole art & science to this practice. Therefore, I'm always happy to come across hubs such as Edge Ryders.\n\n---\n\nI discovered Edge Ryders through the The Babel Between Us experiment, which immediately caught up my attention due to my own experimentations with collaborative writing. And after doing further research on the methods behind BBU, I discovered [SSNA](https://zenodo.org/record/832464#.Xfu4d9ZKgWo), which excited me even more. Mostly because of the similarities between this method and a research experiment I conducted a year ago. In sum, even though I had never heard of digital ethnography or semantic social networks (in those terms), I intuitively did something very similar. \n\nLast year I was invited to work and speak at \u201cSystems Innovation Barcelona\u201d, a systems and complexity conference. I wasn't sure what to present so I decided to open up the creation of my talk to the networks that I permeate, only proposing the overarching theme of \u201cCo-creation & Emergence\u201d.\n\nSo, for 3 months, people from varied backgrounds congregated in online and in-person interactions to reflect on their previous co-creative experiences. And a \"SSNA\" exercise (with a slightly different methodology) emerged when one participant started to map the concepts we were discussing. By following his track, we mapped all other interactions and managed to identify some \u201carchetypical patterns\u201d characterizing emergent phenomena in our experiment. So the [resulting semantic map](https://kumu.io/felipe-silva/co-criacao-emergente#co-criacao-emergente/co-criacao-e-emergencia) served as the backbone of my [meta-presentation](https://bit.ly/2usYQGj) (the presentation tells the story of its generative experiment). On top of that, I wanted to digitally emulate our co-creative dynamic, so I built an [agent-based model](https://github.com/dnllvrvz/Co-creation-and-Emergence) that tried to embed the aforementioned archetypical patterns.\n\nThat was a very fun experiment, and I had a great time with it. However, I had never seen in it the seeds of a comprehensive methodology for the study of collaborative networks. And that's what I've found in your work with semantic social networks! That's really exciting for me! \n\n---\n\nWell, I see this is already a very long post, so I will stop myself. I just really wanted to say hi and also write down my wish to get more involved with what you do. I have taken the time to understand the basic workings of this website, as well as the way Edge Ryders is organized. I see there are many possibilities for engagement, and I hope to explore them.

Let me know what you think:\nIt's called La Serre (French for greenhouse), it's located in Ixelles close to[ Place Flagey,](https://www.google.be/maps/place/Place+Eug%C3%A8ne+Flagey,+1050+Ixelles/@50.8280134,4.3708725,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c3c49314fa21cb:0x103795c88c62478b!8m2!3d50.82801!4d4.3730665?hl=en) and offers:\n\n- 1 main hall with direct access from the street (can host 80 people for sure)\n- 2 smaller rooms (can host about 25, respectively 15 people each). One is suited for screenings too, the other one is like a living room\n- a kitchen accessible from the main hall - no doors between\n- a bar included in the main hall\n- 2 toilets using a water tank (see picture)\n\nUps:\n-bright and good spirited\n-purposed for community usage, looks quite flexible\n-we can get help for the bar & kitchen from community groups in Brussels attached already to run activities here, so we'd be supporting projects for social good\n-we can use the kitchen for cooking together in one meal at least; in general, we would be buying services from food groups (buffet style)\n-we can keep the doors open to the event for interested passers by \n- through the hosts, we can connect with local groups in Brussels who could host activities in the space (ie yoga) \n-accessible by direct bus line from the city center (15 mins) and from the Central train station (20 mins)\n\nDownsides:\n-no Internet connectivity planned, so we'll probably need to get it wired up\n-in this space, I would keep the number of participants at max 80 to manage the 3 rooms. Two are quite small..\n\n**Most importantly: La Serre is one of the community spaces stewarded by an organisation we like in Brussels called [Communa ASBL]**\n(http://communaasbl.wixsite.com/asbl) (a non profit association). For the past 4 years they have been taking over unused spaces in town (ex through agreement with the City authorities) and have revitalized and repurposed them for affordable use by citizens and collectives doing good work. \n\nCommuna is a version of OpenVillage that Edgeryders is contemplating, but the network of spaces works in Brussels only. Here's how: their collective started out as circa 20 people living together and trying to make ends meet as students, using the space they had back then in productive ways (from what I understood, it was a squat). Once they learned how to do it, a subset of the group gradually took over other places in the city, and professionalized themselves in a broad range of skills: from the legal aspects of taking spaces, to equipping them, . \nWe stand to learn from them because they too, are on a quest to building living and working spaces for communities which thrive.\n\nWhat do people think?", "created_at": "2017-08-08 17:08:51.433765", "updated_at": "2017-11-14 12:51:57.244807", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 531, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 264.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3362, 3613], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67045, "user_id": 3947, "topic_id": 12127, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Post-event Summary\n\nYour full name is: \u200b Sohayeb Belghith\n\nYour name on the platform is: @Sohayeb\n\n1.

Event agenda\n\n||Main activities and topics|Participants reflections /Questions|Outcomes of the discussions|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Day 1|* Presentation of different partners and supporters\n* First call with Nadia, to present Edgeryders, Open Village and OCI Lab\n* Icebreak exercice by Enda (energizer)\n* 1st workshop on SDGs and it transformational approach by Imen Hamza, Gender\u2019s programs responsible at Enda inter-arabe\n* 2nd workshop on responsible food production, responsible consumption and fair trade in Tunisia by Hanen Missaoui (Fair Trade project manager)\n* The Product Design session by Suzanna (connection problems prevented us from attending the whole workshop, but we shared the video afterwards)\n* First workshop on ideas development and expected deliverables\n* Edgeryders Icebreaking activity.\n* Participants spent all night in venue to start working on their project ideas|* What are the SDGs ? How SDGs guide social entrepreneurs to tackle urgent issues\n* To tackle environmental issues, is creating a green startup is the only way? why can\u2019t we create enterprises that are environmentally responsible, and not necessarily working directly and only on an environmental problem (is easier for revenue streams)\n* How an international community can support projects in a local context ?\n* What do we mean by product design? how can we put the client at the center of our innovation ? why is it important ?\n* They understood that to start a business or a social business, we have to think first of what need or what social issue must be addressed, not to come up with an idea and try to look for customers.\n\n* There is was a confusion between prototype and mvp for most of the participants.|* Learned more about SDGs, how it can guide them in addressing environmental issues and in designing a social enterprise\n* Got familiar with Edgeryders, its model and what value its community could bring them\n* Understood that environmental issues could be addressed from different perspectives|\n\n|Day 2|\n* 8 hours coaching sessions, 1 to 1, with all teams on business modelling\n* Live chat on Storytelling and pitching for Sales by Matteo.\n* Participants started to work to finalize their Projects and required deliverables.\n* Pitching simulation and P2P Mentoring.\n* Participants spent all night in venue to develop their project ideas, a small prototype (app interface, small drones, platforms interface. etc.) and finalize the deliverables|* Participants have a lot of ideas, how to organize them ? how to realize them? Where to start?\n* Sometimes, their fear of bureaucracy, of regulations etc. (which in many cases is not justified), put \u2018unnecessary\u2019 limits to their imagination and their innovation\n* Something also got my attention, many participants, when tackling environmental issues, designed their projects in first in a way that the state is their main clients, which is not sustainable (too much bureaucracy for a startup if you do not know the right people). Through the coaching sessions, participants reworked their business models in a way to consider the state as an important stakeholder, but not the only or the main client.\n* Questions about how to make money when tackling environmental problems (how to develop a viable business model and how to validate it)|* Participants have a lot of creativity, energy and awareness of environmental problems, yet lack the a clear methodology how to turn their ideas into viable projects. this was addressed through the coaching sessions, where they learned the basics in this, however expressed further support in the future.\n* Participants were introduced to the best practices for pitching, and many liked the call of Matteo (the energy, being interactive, easy english etc.)\n* Being in a workshop with other participants from other countries was exciting. It helped them open their horizons, and gain sometimes more confidence when seeing their peers from other countries having similar ideas and tackling same environmental issues\n* Participants were introduced to the best practices for pitching, and many liked the call of Matteo (the energy, being interactive, easy english etc.)\n* In the pitching simulation, Each team presented their work in front of their peers. This helped to gain feedback and share experiences. But what was interesting in this session, that when each team has been trying to defend their project ideas, they were sensitizing each other about the importance of the environmental issues they were trying to solve, without being aware of this. For instance, one of the teams worked on smart sensors to be installed in fishers boats, so wherever they go, it will their initiative to gain valuable data on pollution in oceans and seas. Presenting figures to defend their idea, and discussing them with their peers helped to put a light on this issue, which has been ignored before.|\n|Day 3|\n* Participants kept finalizing their prototypes and their deliverables\n* Participants put with the support of local team their deliverables on the platform\n* Pitching session with Enda inter-arabe and Dar Blockchain to select winning teams (for prizes from local sponsors)|* Aside from questions around the deliverables, the Many questions were asked about the OCI Lab, how mentoring will take place, the language, the frequency, etc.|* In the pitching session, 11 teams have presented their ideas and their prototypes. Not all teams completed their work, designed well their projects or completed the prototypes. However, they expressed that this Hackathons made them reflecting and having a deeper understanding of environmental issues even that not necessary will be working on them in the future.\n* 5 teams were able to develop their ideas into a social business and prepare a prototype (The minimum required to advance to a next stage with the right support).|\n\n3.

General remarks\n\nWhich teams did/do you find especially interesting or credible and why?\n\nMany teams had interesting ideas but they need to further do reasearch to refine them, better understand the issues and the market. They might need have trainings to acquire the necessary skills before start working on ventures/businesses. However the Hackathon was a good opportunity to gain better understanding of the environmental problems in their communities. Awareness issue was mentioned in almost all projects but many projects talked also about that, though people are aware, yet they are not sensitized to take action. Many have suggested to use \u201cgaming\u201d as a way to address this, including two projects (GTherapy and Leafs, though the teams\u2019 members are aged 17 years old, but with great potential). Other team have presented another perspective for carpooling, by getting inspired from Uber. The idea is to create a system of trustworthiness that allows drivers who have available places, to pick up people in their ways, and the latter to trust back drivers. We have become aware also of how pollution in Tunisian seas is threatening the fishery ecosystem.\n\nThese 5 teams, with the right support, could turn their ideas into beautiful social businesses and green startups:\n\n* 1/ G-Therapy: https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-envirement-tunisia-gtherapy/11831/4 : A platform with two components: 1- Instagram-like social media, where people can photographs anything to encourage or to denounce a responsbile behavious in regards to the SDGs 2- Crowdfuning for SDGs\u2019 initiative\n* 2/ Leafs: https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-environment-tunisia-leafs/11837: Gaming app to encourage responsible environmental behaviour and incitize people to take actions.\n* 3/ Fi Thniyti (In my way in Tunisian): https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-for-environment-tunisia/11823 : Uber-like carpooling app that creates mutual trust between drivers with available places in their cars and people in their ways.\n* 4/ Bike to Future: https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-for-environment-tunisia-bike-to-the-future/11834 : An app that encourage people to practice sports (bikes in Gyms) and to produce electricty that could charge their phones (contribute in reducing non renewable energy consumption)\n* 5/ AquaTech: https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-environment-tunisia-aquatech/11830 smart sensors installed in fishers\u2019 boats to analyse water pollution\n\n5. Stats\n\n* Number of participants: 51\n* Gender balance: 27 M / 24 F\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. English language was a barrier for a lot of participants. It was too difficult for them to follow when the speaker is speaking too fast.\n2. You have to make an effort to engage a large group in a workshop, and when it is online the effort must be doubled.\n3. People liked Matteo session because it was interactive and they got the chance to work with him. His english was easy to understand, and he showed great enthousiasme.\n4. Some suggested may be it has been better that each event has a seperate call with speakers, as we had many participants in Tunisia (though I think it is a little bit difficult to do and manage this)\n5. The participants had great issues when trying to work on and complete all deliverables in time, though they have spent 3 days straight in the same venue (almost all of them spent their nights in the venue)\n6. Concerning the 5 first teams, GThearapy, Leafs and Fi Thniyti would need assistance both in developing and refining their business model, have a better understanding may be on international market as they might have the potential to go internationally once their business model is validated and they have their MVP. They would need also technical assistance on the technology aspects of their projects. They will be supported by Enda and Dar BlockChain, and Edgerdyers could offer an international perspective for their projects. The remaining other two projects, they need to better understand their market and refine further their value proposition before tackling product development.\n\n**Pictures**\n\n![76960334_2746114408743176_4292461861187616768_o|690x341](upload://1AeFXMY644jDthVtNFUJH3aM4am.jpeg) ![76967065_2746119448742672_369958690352005120_o|690x353](upload://oFzI2CYvnQU69kefbw1I2KtmzTE.jpeg) ![77315319_2738567872831163_1121201204030865408_o|690x325](upload://6HPzRsX9ihOVA2Vuh5AGvLzyBhf.jpeg) ![77320883_2741421622545788_6380389663005212672_o|690x346](upload://3SzjU9JdAuJim50JSBj4zgJ5pDc.jpeg) ![77360783_2738562622831688_5617002081324892160_o|544x444](upload://7cT3uhc9gj5vld2a78jH0AxbAZP.jpeg) ![78103680_2746114222076528_4304599511780556800_o|690x342](upload://dWmEIBz5fsUPYq3SOTRi8g11Til.jpeg) ![78306045_2738563492831601_8598089381980405760_o|690x415](upload://j4zG0YdFaFVA2CSE4fUpAQ2hZSy.jpeg) ![78336726_2741419329212684_8966562318590672896_o|690x352](upload://19AuLnu8xAlpZpzWnDgrS6hK3Oj.jpeg) ![78681693_2738566582831292_84541620858388480_o|690x342](upload://affF4deVheFQaLpfdxSG9uKhfFS.jpeg) ![78837016_2746118462076104_615770573624049664_o|690x290](upload://p7fBsO072Z4ymE9JaUyrBCysP1P.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-12-05 22:40:04.765811", "updated_at": "2019-12-05 22:40:04.765811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1876, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 145.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [65500, 65508, 65501, 65507, 65506, 65503, 65504, 65502, 65487, 65499, 65484], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5843, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86028, "user_id": 3677, "topic_id": 14704, "post_number": 3, "raw": "**What is the significance of food in your family or in your culture?

Wait for some hours to download the so-called blockchain (some hundred megabytes).</li>\n\n<li>Get some Bitcoins. Usual way is to buy some on a <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchanges\">Bitcoin exchange</a>, but you could also sell something on, say, <a href=\"http://bitmit.net\">bitmit.net</a> (Bitcoin auction / shopping portal).</li>\n\n<li>To buy something, you'll have to use the Bitcoin client to send some of your bitcoins to the receiver's bitcoin address, which looks like for example \"143PV9zhJUwCiTDD8i7FE16JbfiJvX9zQo\". The transaction is more or less instant and basically cost-free, and shows up in the other party's Bitcoin client.</li>\n\n<li>To receive something, hand out one of your Bitcoin addresses shown in your Bitcoin client software.</li>\n\n</ol>You see the whole system behaves much like \"real\" money; there's no peer-to-peer crediting scheme like in barter currencies and time banking. Thus, Bitcoin lacks the better money supply (and the economic incentive) of credit-based money schemes, but might be a better \"store of value\" option.\n\nThe actual inner workings of Bitcoin are a quite ingenious cryptographic scheme that includes some distributed supercomputing \"proof of work\" concept to make the transactions happen and be irreversible.

We're a New York based company. However, I'm based in Berlin. Of course, at the moment we are 100% remote. But we love to promote flexible work styles. That includes coworking. We're huge advocates for coworking spaces and of course remote work and any kind of work that encompasses allowing people to work from where they need to or which makes them more productive and provides professional environments.\n\nWhat I do specifically for Upflex is that I partner with spaces all over the world. So we have more than 4,000 space partners and more than 8,000 spaces on our platform that we partner with for people that need hot desks or private offices or meeting rooms. What we do is we actually package that and promote it to companies that are looking to implement more of a flexible work environment within their companies, especially during the last couple of years. People have been coming away from the headquartered model of having actual locations where they send their employees to.\n\nWe're creating a new product that allows them to let people work from where they need to and create meeting areas rather than a place that you have to be located every day, 9:00 to 5:00, as well as commuting to.\n\nWe work with established companies and enterprise companies, large teams that are essentially remote and distributed. They may have locations all over the world, and they have headquarters in many cities. Instead of having an office building for 200 people in the middle of Manhattan, why not allow for people to work in Williamsburg and work in Brooklyn and not have to take the trains right into the city center. Right? So creating an option that, or of course, if you want to hire remotely, but still give someone the option to work from a professional environment that suits their job role or suits their working style. Typically platforms like us, there are other ones out there, however,  are more geared toward freelancers or individuals looking for spaces or kind of building their company. \n\nPart of the appeal of coworking spaces for them is that they can go and have a one month contract and then cancel it at any time so they not buying real estate for 10 years. But coworking companies suffered a lot from that. There are a lot of spaces, unfortunately, that won't make it through COVID because of the month-to-month contracts and the way things went in that regard, or they were just starting out or even some of the bigger players, they didn't have a lot of money in the bank. They might've been also going month to month because they were doing fundraising or VC, things like that.\n\nSo it is possible that some of the bigger players that we're used to seeing might be acquired by someone else. That is probably going to be the future. However, as much as they were hit hard and we lost a lot of spaces, and we'll continue to lose spaces over the year, coworking is going to come back stronger than ever. It's going to be needed more than ever. That is because of the transition of companies coming away from the headquartered model, wanting a more flexible lease and also this huge realization that, \"Yes, we can work remotely. I don't need to have my team all in one space, five days a week, eight hours a day.\"\n\nCworking spaces will be inundated with clients, and of course, adjusting to these flexible models and kind of changing even their space and what the requirements are. So for example, I love hot desking. I like walking into a space and just popping my computer open and feeling whatever perspective I want to have that day, instead of having my own dedicated, desperate work every day. That's not really how I operate.\n\nHowever, a lot of these spaces are going to be taking that element away for a while because the open concept is not so safe. It's not really something that I think people want to be doing. Even companies that had open space offices within a coworking space, so maybe for 20 of their people, they're going to start creating boundaries between the people that are working there. So whether it be screams or if they spread people out a little bit more. This means that the design of the spaces will change. Then of course, the influx of customers is going to change. It's going to take some time, probably like fall to later in the year. But people will want to return to work. They don't want to work from home. But they also know that they don't want to commute to the office five days a week again.\n\nTechnology plays a really big role in how coworking spaces are trying to develop the best experience possible, the most seamless experience possible. Of course, it is the future. I think people are really drawn to that aspect of things, and when we're trying to develop a new work style, that's always of interest to us using technology, whether it be for data or information and as well as making the process a lot more simplified.\n\nWith regards to technology and how that interacts, there's a lot of ways that coworking spaces are using technology in order to mitigate certain issues or just make the experience a lot more simplified. So we're of course looking to do integrations in the future, but there are inventory controls where they can put those online and have providers like us be able to tap into their inventory of what's available in their space, whether it be meeting rooms, private offices or hot desking. There is also accessibility options. Using keyless entry, you can do that through the app, and that can be integrated with their own systems that are in their buildings. So people can walk in and have a touchless system, and they know that that person has entered the building through those integrations.\n\n\nEssentially  we provide a platform for communications to happen. We are definitely, first and foremost, a technology platform. We don't have a product other than that. Our inventory doesn't belong to us. So it's all independent operators or business centers. They own their own real estate. \n\nOur solution is an application that allows for companies to white label the app. Let's use Coca-Cola, for example. They're not a client of ours, but let's hope one day they might be. But we could brand the app to have Coca-Cola logos. So when the employee is logging in, they're going to see that it's a company app rather than they're just using the third-party Upflex. So it's integrated with their culture. That's the idea. Then this app communicates with all of our spaces. It notifies them when people are coming and allows them to control their inventory online. So it's definitely like, I guess, a workspace that is put online until you actually physically go and check into the location.\n\nOur product was little bit early in the remote working industry, we had been really pushing our ideals, and we see that this is going to be the future. So when people were coming in, and we're speaking to companies, they didn't see that this would be an option for them. Then all of a sudden COVID hits, and then we got launched right onto the front lines of people realizing they don't want to have a 10-year lease anymore with our company, that it is way too expensive. So it was a lot of preaching that goes on and teaching people and helping them understand, yeah, this is a great option for your company and even talking to the spaces and seeing if this is something that would be valuable to them. \n\nNot only that these companies are experiencing remote work for the first time, in some cases because all of their teams were just sent home to work, and they're trying to navigate how Zoom works and how they can still run their companies without being in each other's space. Right? All of that happened, which immediately created inquiries for us and how companies are planning for the future.\n\nBoth on the space side and the client side, we've really had a huge influx of people inquiring about our company and fully understanding and embracing what it is that we were trying to bring to the market. So that's a really huge deal. So our projections, the statistics we had, all of the information that we had and as a group in the remote work industry, I think we're projecting this to be more realistic for next year. I don't think that we were really anticipating this quickly, all these companies going, \"Hey, wait a minute. Yeah, this works.\"\n\nThat was the first thing for our product, which of course is a really good thing for us. It's too bad that it had to be such a horrible incident for people to realize this. Then internally, we preach remote work, but I'm going to be honest that our company's still required a lot of attendance. So the New York office, they have a small team there and our CEO, Christophe really liked people coming into the office because he's that kind of person that's really social. He likes to brainstorm and be there in person. I've been remote the entire time that I've worked for Upflex. But all of our team was forced to go remote and start testing what it is that we do and testing our model.\n\nI must say it's been a really big surprise to Christophe as well that we all really came together, we made it work, and we were all way more productive. So as much as they don't want to admit it, it really, really changed things. I also was way more pulled into the team, more included in the team because all of us were online and there and present instead of our weekly meeting or catch-up. So that was a really great learning experience for us, and I know that that's something we're going to carry forward now, and Christophe has converted into, \"Yeah. However you guys want to work, let's actually practice what we've preached.\"\n\nThen from there, we created a really amazing product out of this. So of course, you have to be working on your toes. How are we going to be in the post COVID-19 world? How is that going to look and function? It ended up that we created a program called Safe Spaces, and we created a seal in partnership with Colliers International, which is a major real estate brokerage company. They saw the benefit of our product. What we decided, or what we realized is that people are going to have a hard time returning to the workplace because of, is it safe? Should I be leaving my home? If I'm going to be in a space with other people, is this okay? Then a lot of people that were working from home that actually don't enjoy that or they have kids or there's all these different things that don't allow for their space to allow for a professional environment.\n\nWe developed a bridge program where you can now filter for spaces that are adhering to local regulations. For example, in the United States, it's CDC and obviously The WHO, and then of course, whatever they want to implement themselves. A lot of spaces are even putting temperature regulators or a way that you can walk past, and they can determine if somebody has a temperature. That's not a requirement by any means, but some spaces went above and beyond.\n\nWe've also become kind of a beacon for people and spaces to say or to understand what it is that they can do in order to get ready to have people return to work. For us this has meant there's been a lot of educating and communicating: \" this is what's happening with our partners in China. This is what's worked for them. Let's bring that model over to Europe, and then of course, extend that to the United States.\" So a lot of communication and just really focusing on getting that bridge to bring people back to the workplace.\n\nWith regards to technology what I recommend for coworking clients, the most important thing would probably be to partner with companies like ourselves, like Upflex or people that are able to, whether it's bring extra people in and fill your space in a time where a lot of people aren't going there or a time where coworking has really suffered.\n\nUsing technology platforms like ourselves and companies that are advocating coworking spaces and also doing a lot of blogging and a lot of communication and things like what we're doing right now and educating that way, that's a really great way to get your space recognized, and people who might not know that you exist, it's a great way to advertise yourself. Even if you don't necessarily get customers directly through that platform, it's a way to get your name out there.\n\nI think that's really important. The safety component is really important for people, and everybody wants to know, \"Okay, what's going to happen. What is it going to look like when I return? Because I don't want to be sitting across from somebody that I don't know. I do want to be safe because then I have to go home to my family. But on the other hand, I really need to get back out of my house or get back into the workplace.\" So there's lots of technology that can help you with that. It can be quite expensive. So you need to pick and choose during this time of what's most important. But I do think the keyless entry is going to be a huge thing for people.\n\nTouchless. Everyone's talking about touch surfaces, and this is the big trend right now. You don't want to touch anything on necessarily in a public space. So having access, purchasing through your phone, having everything, all of your merchandise or anything that you want to purchase, whether it be a meeting room within this space, all of that can be managed through apps and through technology that is specifically geared toward coworking spaces and helping that be functional. Then any of those technologies that existed before COVID have been adapting to COVID and making sure that it's functioning for the needs of what's to come and the restructuring.\n\nReflecting on experiences from the intense user testing we've done the last few months about what I think are really important features for a remote team to work together well...\n\nRecording the information, storing it where it's accessible and having a map so that people can access all that information, that's the best way to handle it so that I can go and grab a document. I don't have to ask my colleague where it is and communicating that all the time.  Our CPO, Ginger Dhaliwal, is always making us write everything down. In every meeting, we're typing it out. Over-communication - which I get really bothered by if someone asks me many, many times, something that I felt that I have already been very clear about. I've had to reflect on myself and understand that's a really important thing to be doing is that communicate everything all the time. You're not there in person. Then when you go away to have your day, and you're not there to remind people what's going on, it's really important to continuously repeat information.\n\nOf course, meetings. The amount of productivity and work you can get done if you limit your meeting time.  I don't love having a million meetings all the time because it is very disruptive. I feel like when teams are remote, they do it in almost as a way to show, \"Hey, I'm here, and I'm working. I'm online. The little light is on, on my Slack that shows I'm live.\" I don't really subscribe to that. I'm really like, \"Let's have meetings if we need them.\" Because the flow of my day it gets disrupted. That's a huge thing that happens in the office space, right?\n\nOf course, keep them for strategy or if you're building something together or have, of course, your team meetings. But jumping on a million calls a day with your colleagues just because they're not in the office beside you to talk and respecting that time I felt has really worked. But this is stuff we've talked about. Right? So I've had to be really vocal like, \"Hey, this doesn't need to be a meeting. Send me an email.\" Stuff like that.\n\nThat's been working for us. But with regards to technology, there's just not so much that you need. It all depends on what you're doing. Zoom has been amazing. We like Zoom. It works for us, and of course, just having the cloud, everything mapped out and accessible so that you can find all the information and documents you need in order to do your job effectively.\n\nSomewhere in between is what the future is going to be. Then of course, making sure that the spaces can accommodate a certain amount of people, which again, may change the affordability of things because if you're not using every little square foot that you have or square meter that you have, creating more spacing, that can create a different pricing model. So I'm interested to see how that will also be affected.\n\nRural coworking, I think they're going to suffer the most, unfortunately. If they were able to get government help, that's great if they could stay open. But I think if they can hold on, there's going to be a huge driver there, and that's something that I've been advocating for, and I always try to partner with spaces in rural areas because those are the places where people want to live and work from. They don't need to be in the city center to do their job effectively. So I do believe more of those spaces will start popping up. Hopefully, some are able to make it through this time, financially they will be. But they know that they have to be on board with these health and safety regulations in order to make the space feel safe for others.\n\nI've been communicating with spaces all over, some that are in smaller towns or that are wanting to open during this time because the demand is starting to increase. But it's always going to be regional. It's always going to be based on the regulations, how far along they are and the reopening process after lockdown. But I do think that some of these methods and precautions are here to stay. The spacing issue, I think, is really going to be a thing because people didn't like that to begin with. You don't want someone in your direct vicinity. So that's going to be something that will be taken into the future. \n\nWith respect to membership models, a lot of spaces immediately took away their day use. So you can't just be a random person walking in off the street anymore, booking a day pass at a coworking space. Of course, it's because they wanted to cater to their own membership. If they're already only allowed to occupy maybe 60% of their space or 50% of their space, they have to first and foremost address their members that stayed with them during that time, making them feel safe, making sure they can return. So any flexibility memberships went out the window, to begin with because they just can't allow for strangers to come in, or they just can't occupy the space because they're operating at a percentage of their capacity.\n\nI love independent spaces. These are the ones that have character and really interesting communities. So I think they're really important to include. We have many on our platform. If you are to use your inventory, so you need to also consider what you have and what's empty and how you want to leverage it. So again, we allow for you to put one hot desk on our platform if you want, or you can have 10 meeting rooms and 50 private offices and 60 spaces for hot desking, depending on your capacity. So it's up to you to control it as the owner or the manager at the space. So you can go on and take it away and add it as you need to as much as you want.\n\n\n\n\nDuring these months, a lot of them did restructure their pricing model, or they removed a whole aspect of their membership, and then they were going into long term. Some people econstructed their offices completely and took away all the open areas and made them enclosed and maximized that. For example, we reevaluated our membership pricing. We are a membership-based platform up at Upflex. We realized where the demand is coming in. We knew that people are scared to be in open spaces with strangers or even with their colleagues. So we created a product, which is private offices for durations. So flexible private offices, whether it be by the day so that a team can go into an enclosed area and work together and do some strategy if they need to be together in person. Or you can do that by the week or by the month, depending on how long.\n\nThen of course, if those people are done after a certain project, they can go back to their respective environments and wherever they were working for or from previously. We've changed our product to accommodate that and accommodate what clients are actually asking for. Then of course, we're taking that to our spaces and letting them know, \"Hey, this is what everyone's asking for, You might want to consider reflecting the demand\u201d. I've noticed that a lot of people are going to that.\n\nI do see that the flexibility model is not going to go away completely. I think the day passes will not be so popular for a little while. But the flexibility is going to come into play, and then the memberships will have to reflect that.\n\n\nCoworking spaces need to be considering short term and not always committing to, \"Oh, I need somebody in here for a month.\" What if there is a team of four people that just need a space for two days? Would you rather it sit empty, or would you rather people be in there? So finding ways to do that and fill the space during times may be taking a little less money than you'd normally would. It's better to utilize and leverage that inventory, especially during this time when it's uncertain and people are just wanting to dip their toe in the water. So that's a really great way to do it. Put the inventory online. The requests come in 24 hours in advance. So if you just happen to fill them, we just can communicate that to our client and say, \"Actually, the space is unavailable.\"\n\nWhen we talk about technology...Keyless/ touchless entry. Maybe you don't want to interact with a person and have a receptionist lead you around and speak to you or have someone that has to be there, touchless entry is a great way to overcome that and also to allow for 24-hour access when maybe you don't want to be there, and you just want to allow your members to come in and work late. there are several  touchless entry tech providers out there but I'm a really big fan of KISI. I know the founders there. They're great guys, and they've built a great product. We aren't integrated with them yet. But they have their own separate app and keyless entry, or you can have card entry. They are a German company I believe, but they are based out of New York. Every space that I know in New York City uses Kisi, and it's super convenient, and it's also a great way for the space to know who's in their building as well. Right? So for safety, for security it's really great.\n\nWhen we talk about technology we can also just talk about internet and communication and getting the word out. I think if that is the best way to mitigate these issues or to stay in business, for example, and again, partnerships, making sure that everyone knows who you are, that you're talking to people, that you're talking to the right people. If you want to talk about rural coworking or even just intercity coworking, get involved in your community as much as possible and find ways to make sure people know who you are and know that you exist, know that you have inventory like that, and also know that there is a solution to working from home.\n\nLots of communication, lots online. A good example, I guess, would be Knotel there are quite a major company out of New York City, and they're in many locations. They were shut down when New York was shut down, and they weren't able to operate. What they did was they used their space and provided it to essential workers for a place to rest or some nurses and doctors, if they just need a place to lay down or somewhere to go to be alone or whatever it is, maybe to just eat and decompress without having to leave the city if they needed to be in proximity to the hospital or where they were working, or even if they couldn't go home, for example, because they might infect their family during this time.\n\nThey used their space during a really hard time, and that got them a lot of publicity. I'm not saying, \"Oh, they just did it to get the publicity.\" But it was really valuable to their branding and to their company and what they represent and when they stepped up during a really hard time and offered their spaces at no cost to people that really needed it. So things like that. Again, like I said, getting involved in your community and ensuring that communication is there and providing education like this to people that are looking to maybe get into the coworking space. But all of that can be done online. I think that's the best way to go. But otherwise, coworking is an in-person experience.\n\nSo technology plays a certain role in it. But I would say that just use the internet and use your networks and get to know people. Another example would be the UK. I know they were having a lot of trouble actually getting financial support as coworking space operators, which is really troubling. They were signing petitions and trying to get the government to actually recognize and provide them with these bailouts that a lot of other people were entitled to in getting, whether it be unemployment, et cetera, and they somehow fell into this no man's land, and they weren't eligible for this type of compensation.\n\nAs a space you need to be motivated to go out and ask for that type of help and spread the word. There were a lot of petitions that were signed. I think it was eventually overturned, and they were able to get some financial assistance. But understanding how valuable spaces within a community and what they actually bring to the community, if that was recognized by the government, and now that it is recognized by the government, they understand the value, right? That's a great way to stay in business during this time when you're having financial hardship or you don't know where you're going to be in the next six months.\n\nWe are advocates within our company, and we do partner with a lot of education platforms. We aren't an education platform. It just so happens that continuously, we are educating people through our product and by giving the option and making it available. So partnerships with these education platforms, which there are many out there, we do promote them on our site. We promote them to companies that are considering using our product. So having a nice network is really great to offer those things where you might have a weakness.\n\nHowever, we do provide a lot of recommendations as to how you can structure your team. So,  there might be a team that needs an office of 20 people, and that's okay. That's okay if you want to go and have that routine. Some people need it. Some people like it. But there might be five people on your team that don't, and they want to work from home, and then there might be another five that really enjoy working from coworking spaces or one that's a little closer to their home.\n\nSo our platform allows you to manage that or develop a system so that everybody can work the way that they need. That's what we're really trying to do to make it as flexible as possible to have the most diverse team and the most functional aspect of flexibility that you can. But again, the education component needs to be left to the professionals, and there's so many out there. There's so many great resources, even ROE remote. That's a great way to learn how you can do that and implement it. It's going to forever be ongoing education, right? Because I think the industry is pretty new, and technology keeps developing, so staying on your toes and really knowing what you can provide to your clients and making sure that they're getting the best resources available to them to make sure that this works and everyone's happy.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*This conversation is part of our event on 21/7.

There is an element of courage, of the elation of doing something difficult together. \n* This has been our aspiration for years, with the unMonastery and the Open Village.\n* We want to be neighbors to a university-powered innovation lab, and to offer residencies to engineers, biodesigners, inventors and artists to help us re-invent urban living. \n* We also want to be a hub for the neighborhood for this stuff. Matt has some very cool ideas about neighborhood grids, and we could have parties demonstrating cool tech, like the calcium chloride-dehydration of food. Or even a courtyard party in the winter, demonstrating \"stillsuits\" to keep us warm in cold weather. Matt to write a concise description of this, so I do not say incorrect things.\n\nVideo material:\n\n* New interview to me only (Matt's back in Germany).\n* Salvaging some stuff from Matt's existing footage (for example where he speaks about his truck). \n* Fragments from videos we find lying around.

Wow, that was a killer presentation! My name is Alberto, and I hope to prove you wrong on the \"theoretical physics is useless in practice\" line. It also looks like you might be wasted doing boring work with code: plus, Edgeryders is Drupal, which is PHP, not Python.\n\nMany physicists know some network science. Those that don't, being good at math, can easily learn it. Would you be interested in participating in a hackathon that uses network science to figure out how online communities evolve? <em>That's </em>going to use plenty of Python. I plan it for March, in Italy.\n\nBackground: we at Edgeryders are really interested in a network approach at studying how our own online community behaves \u2013 at least,\u00a0 <em>I</em> am and the others at least humour me! The thinking behind this is that, if we can teach ourselves how to \"steer\" emergent social dynamics of online conversations, we can use networked humans as a very large and powerful engine for problem solving. I tried to outline the dream in a TEDx talk a few years ago. A near-real time interactive network representation of Edgeryders is <a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">here</a>, and you are welcome to play with it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/KKrM2c-ww_k", "created_at": "2014-12-09 15:16:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.993980", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 251, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8433], "is_liked_by": [2437], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13225, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3299, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Re:</b>\n\nHi @#46, hope this helps:\n\n<em>1. I can't find away to stack individual days in columns side by side </em>\n\nYou could use a selector like <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">.view-conference-events .view-grouping {\u2026}</code> to get the columns (though not each one separately) and then assign floating and limited widths to them to get them side-bu-side. If you want to do something to individual day columns, there is the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/5664791/1270008\">CSS3 :nth-child() selector</a> (not too pretty a solution tho ...). If all that is not what you are looking for, I'd need to do <a href=\"http://drupal.stackexchange.com/a/30194/16305\">some templating as a proper solution</a>.\n\nHowever, maybe it's not worth the effort to try column-wise display at all? You will not be able to get a grid-layout as in you nice static HTML program, because the columns are independent here, not like in a table. But I remember that in the call, Nadia showed the example from that barcamp format conference where it was no grid either, but a list of days (like now, not even independent columns).\n\n<em>2. Is there a delay in the caching of CSS changes?</em>\n\nAw, yes, sorry I forgot to tell. We have CSS minifying and aggregation enabled for performance reasons, effectively resulting in CSS caching. So when using CSS injector, click \"Clear all caches\" <a href=\"/admin/config/development/performance\">here</a> after an edit. Or for a more convenient solution, temporarily disable \"Aggregate and compress CSS files.\" on that page until you are done with your editing.\n\n<em>As for the community program, I added the 2 top tables from the other program and applied CSS to the page but for some reason none of it's showing up </em>\n\nSorry, don't get it. Where is the community program (URL)? What is not showing up, the top tables or the CSS changes? Are the CSS changes again due to the caching issue maybe? There's nothing I am aware of that I need to do to custom blocks first. If the block is there, you can style it ...\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-20 22:25:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.875631", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13214], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45966, "user_id": 4260, "topic_id": 8800, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Hi everyone!\n\nThank you all for the much-needed webinar!

Edgeryders itself is pretty much a community effort, crystallized around an initial investiment by the Council of Europe; and the amount of creativity you will find in the \u00a0hundreds of mission reports and thousands of comments is mindblowing. So far, so good.\n\nBut.\n\nOne: your benches example would be illegal in many places. The urban game invented by Augusto (an Edgeryders from Italy: do yourself a favor and check out what he is doing, because it resonates very much with your own approach) had its community beautify phone booths (hardly used in the age of the mobile phone), and they got a cease-and-desist call from the relevant Telco. Collaborative-creative is not an unstoppable force (yet?); rather a fragile flower. Most people don't get it one bit. A vast majority, I would say.\n\nTwo: of course, if you ask people what they want, they will typically lie. Psychologists have known this for a long time. They will indulge in projecting an ennobled image of themselves, or they will interpret the question as a sort of test and behave strategically. If you go look where they put their money and effort, well - that will tell you a very different story. This is why real life urban planning exercises tend to result in luxury condos and shopping malls rather than theaters and public squares.\n\nNone of this undermines your <em>strategy</em>. I am not too convinced about your <em>tactics</em>, which - if I read it well - is simply to assume the advantages of creative-collaborative are self-evident and they are taking roots.

For me the most important takeaways for now (as you said, we've just started scratching the surface of something so detrimental) are the following:\n\n1. we need to increase tech literacy about the systems in place: if we (individuals, governments, policymakers) don't know how the black boxes work, how do we know that what they promise us is actually what results they give us. How can we question outcomes if we aren't informed about the manner in which the systems arrive at conclusions?\n2. we also need to understand the tipping point into creating action: when was the last time you really got upset and demanded change? The problem lays again with the fact that we often don't even know about the injustices (from increased traffic, to the inability to speak to people instead of machines). This topic I think relates to the first point. We can't be angry to the point of taking action (protests, etc), if we don't even realize/understand where the injustice is coming from. Side note: we may even want to take it further: should we use certain systems if we don't know how they work?\n3. If actors say they need certain systems, we need to ask them why. Why not do it by hand? The idea is that these systems will solve everything, but they are just accelerating broken systems. \n\nLooking forward to hear what the other people at the event found most interesting!

There I also learned about Edgeryders. I am an interdisciplinary artist and design researcher with a MA in Information Experience Design from the Royal College of Art in London who relocated to Stockholm in 2018.\n\nI love to participate in and facilitate interdisciplinary communication and exchanges. Therefore I am very interested in your type of research in general as well as this topic of the development of a more human-centric internet embracing and developing important key values.\n\nSince 2010 I have lived in 6 different cities and 3 different countries in Europe and I very much appreciate being able to do that and the experiences and encounters I had and have. However, sometimes I am questioning the effect of being disconnected from long term political and cultural discussions and participation due to this modern nomad lifestyle shared by so many of our generation, which is another reason I would be interested in this project.\n\nMy native language is German and additionally I have professional language skills in Englisch, am on a conversational level in Swedish and can just about ask for the bathroom in Spanish ;).\n\nDuring my MA and I took part in the online community of the Information Experience Design program where we exchanged texts, ideas, upcoming events and had discussions. (We went through various community and discussion tools before settling for facebook after all.)\n\nProfessionally I have worked in multiple groups making heavy use of online tools such as slack, messenger and Trello to plan, communicate and discuss projects and topics with people working from different locations and countries.\n\nIn my private life I am of course part of many WhatsApp and facebook groups keeping alive relationships and friendships over long distances for long periods (especially the groups including relatives certainly include some rather heated discussions and need diplomatic skills ;)).\n\nFor my previous job with the financial education app Gimi I also participated in quite a few online user chats on our Intercom with parents and children using the app, reacting to and answering around the clock if necessary.\n\nAdditionally I think that the experiences and abilities I have from for example performing qualitative interviews in user research projects for example with the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Inclusive Design as well as participating in, designing and facilitating workshops and discussions of an interdisciplinary character in- and outside the university in a non-online setting are relevant.\n\nI have an inherent urge to find points of connections between topics and people thinking about those topics, which I call being a &ldquo;compulsive connector&rdquo;. I love to recommend books and texts as well as potential collaboration or conversation partners to the people I meet and am very open to listening to and exploring the point of view of others, trying to find some common ground upon which we can communicate.\n\nI recently started my setting up my studio in Stockholm working as an artist and design researcher and working part time with you as a community manager with you would fit in very well, while probably also complimenting my other work and research.\n\nYou can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQoOCAbKH1FFWIyLlHvDKWMOdqTS8IX3/view?usp=sharing).\n\nI am looking forward to more communication,\n\nMaria", "created_at": "2019-03-12 17:11:49.149440", "updated_at": "2019-03-12 17:11:49.149440", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 564, "wiki": false, "reads": 59, "score": 151.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56431, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 10131, "post_number": 27, "raw": "Only topic creators.

It is defined as a four steps framework:\n\n1. have identified a need(s) that customers have,\n2. built the right product to satisfy that customer\u2019s need(s),\n3. tested the correct methods for acquiring and converting customers,\n4. deployed the right resources in the organization to meet the demand for the product.\n\nMainly, the customer development process is an iterative approach that leads to an execution phase.\n\n**![R\u00c3\u00a9sultat de recherche d'images pour \"customer development + hypothesis testing\"|624x334.9058769](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jMuSxeH6eb9atBmOP96bpqaPMZtfSO58oexKChs_RfQn7cn9Wo-r-yDqWEE7A-SnEW30xlUb7pmQDHkXyuDckR9ARSVerNWtDNgHfO6aCiba6_CzduNCbs3l5u1VLF9rTROW8hgG)**\nKnowing that customer discovery allows the project leader to turn hypothesis into facts which is a basic step.\n**![|624x320](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bDnpIvvE8BWChxoOEWyb5EtDrOdTvqK4Qk-5VMRGVBUTV4s9B9eQWl1-x-mS5DthTbGVbi2CW2LZ_b69lqLGNxdluuGmFU4OesWncmHfDgszgxzxhYqHZEKHPYTNwrio-Gn8M_7K)**\nMoreover, he displayed a list of DOs and Don'ts of how to proceed with the customer discovery phase. Making surveys, questionnaires, market study, and depending on your own experience isn't an effective way. Indeed, you should observe the customer, and put yourself in the customer's shoes and assure interviews to get insights and the deep motivations behind their behavior. \n\nThere are two types of interviews: One to assess the problem, and the other is to evaluate the strength of the proposed solution. As for the questions, it ought to be detective questions that are also open-ended and nonspecific about your idea.\n\nConcerning how to talk to the users, Mr.Wajdi introduced the concept of \"Mom Test\" which is a set of simple rules for crafting the right questions that even your mom can't lie to you about.\n\nAs for the most efficient methods for conducting an interview, it's preferred if it's in person, a video conference, or a phone call. \nNext, he shared a few best practices concerning the customer interview:\n1. Adopt a beginner\u2019s mindset\n2. Listen more than you talk\n3. Get facts not opinions\n4. Ask \u201cwhy\u201d to get real motivations\n5. Remember: the goal is to learn, not sell\n6. Don\u2019t mention solutions too early\n7. Follow up\n8. Always open doors at the end\n\nLast but not least, he stated that the answer to the question: \u201c Who to ask?\u201d are early adopters and early evangelists defined by Steve Blank as the following: \u201cEarly-Evangelist are Early adopters of your product/service \u201cwilling to take a risk on your startup\u2019s product or service because they can envision its potential to solve a critical and immediate problem\u2014and they have the budget to purchase it.\u201d\n\n**![R\u00c3\u00a9sultat de recherche d'images pour \"earlyvangelist\"|501x394](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6Il7G69s3AjNdSH9TWvvEom66bPGyUaxYe0ztta4ri5y_bu9TjBFxmk_5WWHUnkVR46m6z0GHpeqENU_x1O6pe5K7TcPwEyuC-T2GuSK5IBNDY8Zm9ueKoQIIkogJi8yjVy5Hud2)**\n\nAs for where to find people to interview, it can be through social media, fairs, exhibitions, shows, conferences...etc \n\nFinally, he explained how to debrief by focusing on key-insights regarding research objectives and implications for future interviews.\n\nOffline tasks: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TZWYH3dFpbziclGrh4U_EnJZ87ClPM7Z/view?usp=sharing)\nLab\u2019s material: the[presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UlGTzKhXBknvOcsn-ON18aXyblXC5yqZ/view?usp=sharing) & [some resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TEoSaA1Ls9Xk__kM9T2jRGec-iIC0H65?usp=sharing)\n\nQ & A\n\nQ: @saif.eddine.laalej \n**Should we focus more on the customer or the end User?**\nA: It depends, the end user sometimes is not the one who\u2019s going to pay for the product/service, but they may be important in making certain decisions. It still depends on your product/service you\u2019re selling.  \nQ: @Mohsen\n**Should we talk to them about our competitors?**  \nA: It\u2019s not really interesting to talk about your competitors at this certain phase.\nQ: @saif.eddine.laalej \n**Should we sell the product or the story behind ?**\nA: No, not at this stage. For now, you should try to figure out if you have an actual problem and see if you can solve it.

In a resource-strained world, you need to be smarter in how you search for and acquire resources. What models are most future proof? Funding is perhaps an obvious means but is getting harder to access and research funding often is focused on serving particular sets of interests.\n\nThis session will take a broader look at how to sustain our work in a rapidly changing context. Panel members will share their expertise, followed by Open Space to give participants an opportunity to explore particularly relevant ideas or models in more detail. \n\nThis session has been developed to span all the <a href=\"/t/program/6110\">themes</a> at Open Village, from open science to collective living and working, to culture and policy. What kind of sub topics do you want to see covered in this panel? We want your thoughts on this as well as the kind of panel members you'd love to hear from. \n\nWhile we build the lineup, feel free to put yourself forward as an active contributor and get a ticket to \\#openvillage!\n\n<a href=\"/t/registration/6303\">Learn more.</a>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%; table-layout:fixed;\">\n\n<tbody align=\"center\">\n\n<tr align=\"center\">\n\n<td align=\"center\">\n</br>\n</br>\n<p><b>Paola Villarreal</b></p>\n\n<p>Paola will contribute her experience in doing programming for the greater good and the challenges of financing the work.

That is actually a really good one which can be answered from various angles.\n\nAfter the much-needed summer break relaxed in terms of anti-COVID measures which everyone anticipated with great enthusiasm ([maybe too much](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/czech-public-dinner-lockdown-scli-intl/index.html), some might say), we seem to be witnessing the advent of a darker season. The warning voices came back and the city itself is gradually returning into the quarantine. But the general mindset from both the administration and the public seems to have changed quite markedly. How and why?\n\nAs for the first part of this question, a simple observation might be quite helpful. In March 2020, after recording a steep rise in the number of COVID cases, the government led by the prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161 opted for what could be described as a complete lockdown of the whole country, and the measures implemented garnered praise from [around the world](https://www.praguemorning.cz/could-czechs-measure-to-fight-coronavirus-save-thousands-of-lives-2/). That is something Andrej Babi\u0161 is definiely not used to. On the domestic scene, the modus in which those measures were implemented reaped criticism: the information distribution was erratic, changing on the daily basis (hence [memes](https://images.app.goo.gl/6WFA3HD5WuhaopzC6) about the time periods reserved for 65+ citizens in the supermarkets), and when the government issued the appraised obligation of wearing masks and respirators everywhere, they outright lied about their disponibility in the country. Also, as it turned out later, all of these limitations were decreed unconstitutionally under a state of emergency, which was declared without the approval of the parliament. Despite all that, basically the whole country abided by the rules, regardless of their opinion of the government. As my non-Czech wife wondered: \"This is incredible, a government that no one in this city likes declares something and everyone in Prague follows these orders like trained soldiers.\"\n\nFast forward to our present, the end of September. The COVID spread statistics have been generally growing worse over the last two months, currently, they are actually [six times worse than in March](https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19?utm_source=general&utm_medium=widget&utm_campaign=covid-19). But the daily life in the city goes mostly on as it did during summer. You would not really notice that Prague is a \"red\" zone on various European COVID maps (and Czech ministry of health, as documented by the title picture). The public administration has generally not reacted to this situation, until recently.\n\nSo why has it changed?\n\nPublic perception - definitely transformed. In spring, the general attitude seemed such as the population of the city was genuinely scared of the disease. Right now, the relatively low mortality rate in combination with various other statistical data tends to be used as a proof of the \"spring overreaction.\" For some, these serve as arguments supporting their position, which simply stem from the fact that they grew tired of COVID, of the way in which the qurantine-normality has shifted their lives, \"unnecessarily\", as they do not perceive themselves to be in a risk group. Still, the Prague public seems to be more on the careful side, as the city with its high population concentration is one of the country's COVID foci.\n\nIs it a conspiracy? Well, kind of... Unlike in other places, wild theories of the reptilian-world-mind-control-scheme sort have not gained prominence in the public discussions or politics yet, though you might definitely find them flourishing in the corners of the internet  Instead, there is a pervasive feeling among those who do not like him, that the prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161 is using the COVID situation to bring back totalitarian practices and control of the population by force and to enrich himself and his allies. As a former communist state security agent, a ruthless businessman and politician, his image invites such perception. This is the crossroad at which the clash of personal liberty and collective safety discourses is mostly taking place right now in the Czech Republic. And Babi\u0161 is well aware of that...\n\nWhich brings me to my last point - what attitude is politically more beneficial? While criticized by the political opposition for, as he would say, technicalities, amidst all the confusion, the two steps forward one step back approach of the spring COVID crisis management has mostly gained points for the Babi\u0161 government. With the general discipline loosening, the ruling political forces noticed that the tides have turned. Despite the growing numbers of sick people, the government is carefully weighing each step its takes. When the minister of health, who became somewhat of a scapegoat for all the COVID mismanagement (though he was definitely following orders from above) showed some personal initiative in tightening the measures again (in regard of the mask-wearing obligation, a cornerstone of the governmental PR in spring), he was mercilessly deposed from his function by the prime minister while simultaneously receiving praise for his managerial abilities. And then you realize that the parliamentary upper chamber elections are coming next weekend, so yeah, go figure... Babi\u0161 is a politician, a populist, he has to represent what he claims that it is the people want. But now it seems that even he himself hesitates which camp to join.\n\nThe effect seems to be twofold. Firstly, the narrative of spring overreaction and downplaying of COVID danger is inadvertently supported by the government. All of the administrative bodies of the country, be it the city of Prague, other regional governments, municipalities, Universities etc. are waiting for the regulations from above, which come in an extremely slow tempo. This provokes internal tensions and emergence of pro/anti-COVID-measures tribalism on all levels. Secondly, the numbers of COVID proliferation are still high (despite a small decline) and this time no one is even improvising a general plan as of now. Some marginal selective (and questionable) measures cannot be counted as such (pubs close at 10, the audience has to be sitting in cultural events etc.). \n\nSo, we will see \"how is Prague\" in a month.", "created_at": "2020-09-28 14:48:40.909655", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 09:23:33.425767", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1062, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 478.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4795, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28639, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6096, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Major problem :-) </b>\n\n... for the 8th.

Took me some time to figure out which medium to use to reach people. Facebook and personal approach were the ones I thought would work best and that's what I did. \nHave to say in  my contract we agreed this was a part time job but it was far from that. I worked a lot. Serbian people are very very sceptic and when something new comes they  instantly do not trust it nor like it. I guess that's understandable considering what this people have been trough for the past 3 decades.\nMy idea was to reach only those I considered to be genuinely  interested in this type of community. And to bring interesting people in workshop, especially when it comes to speakers because I needed those who people trust.\nThis is a completely new experience for me. I had never before organized an event or been in a community or been facilitator at the event.\nHuge thanks goes to @Noemi and @jasen_lakic , cause I don't know how would this be a thing without them. We had a month and a half to put it all together. It was intense.\n\n **The event**\n\nAround 25 people registered for the workshop and 17 actually came. \nAfter short introduction Noemi came up with the idea how to \"make\" all participants relaxed and comfortable to speak. We played a game and I think that was the key for successful workshop.\nEveryone had fun, everyone participated and talked. Atmosphere was friendly, as if everyone knew each other. It was easygoing and the energy was really good. Participants said it would be fine if it lasted for 2 days :) \nAll of the participants were confused by the Edgeryders concept and had no idea what is going on. But they showed up anyways which is a great indicator that we need stuff like this here in Serbia.\nThe whole event was more like introducing Edgeryders and getting to know each other, there was not a specific topic that was mainly discussed, which is fine I think. \n\n**After the event**\n\nFeedback is positive. Everyone had a great time, we laughed, we discussed, we learned and all left facility feeling inspired. Workshop was different than those we are used to here. Everyone liked that it was interactive and that everyone participated. I feel as if people are sick of just listening to those who always speak and they sit and listen. \nParticipants were pretty heterogeneous and we all liked that. Tho it was a strong feeling that there is something we all have in common regardless to what we do and who we are.\n\n**How did i do** \nI am pretty satisfied. Considering it is my first job in this kinds of stuff. Still I have a lot to learn about building a community, organizing the events and get into peoples minds to optimize the effect and the results.\nAs a facilitator I was pretty shy and nervous :slight_smile:\nI am happy with my communication abilities  and how easy it is for me to make people trust me, I didn't know that before.\nThe whole process and stepping into unknown was pretty stressful but I liked it. This is exactly what I wanted and needed.\n \n**What have I learned**  \n\n-From Edgeryders- I learned that there are people who actually work on these topics and this area as a job. As I said earlier I didn't have any contact with this before. I learned how much I have to learn about society and how to be useful. I met some very interesting people in this process and that is my goal. Creating my network of great people. \n-At the workshop- Learned about technical stuff about workshop organizing. How to approach. what is important, how to relax people...\nPlus I learned that there are people here who really care about themselves and their society, they are not those who are brainwashed and they have great ideas and great enthusiasm. \n\n**What I think our next steps should be**\n\nPeople are sick of listening to some whit great spirit and ideas talking to them and telling them how they should do something. If we want these people who showed interest to stay with us we need to give a few examples of how to do things, how to get in action. We are not used to this. We need examples. Telling them \"Gather around something you consider important for you\" will do nothing. We are society who is deeply depressed and we lack of enthusiasm and initiative.\nWe need at least 2 small events we will organize to give an example and make them open their minds and think what could they gather around by themselves.\nMaybe exchange of books, or clothing(we have that going on every winter)... Anything to make them do not forget why we are here.\nIt's even hard to get their stories on the platform, tho Jasen and I thought that's gonna be easy.\nThey simply have to see things going on. Talking will get us nowhere.  \n\nI am pretty sure this report is not done. I will add things.\nThank you everyone!", "created_at": "2019-11-27 11:23:55.318718", "updated_at": "2019-12-04 14:06:25.939081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 893, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 195.2, "like_count": 10, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4, 5698, 1856, 3, 5, 4794, 5538, 6164, 5551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80295, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14068, "post_number": 3, "raw": "what do you mean with this?

Perhaps most simply, this occurred because regulation couldn\u2019t keep up with the pace of technological advancement. But the value doesn\u2019t end in data, and another layer has emerged that may offer a way to reclaim the rights to our identity in a new language. A language that may in fact liberate us from the social codes that have held us back. **A language that has the power to move beyond class, gender, race, able-bodies, and even human-ness, and orient itself rather in the right to choose.** This language might just be made possible through _entitlements_. \n\nBeing under versed in the technicality of the internet and much more at home in speculating decentralised infrastructures for collective wellbeing, I admit now that I am missing certain finite details behind the complex field of entitlements. And this is why collaborative leadership is so important: it is what brings heads of government units to share a table with philosophers and vice-mayors, digital security advocates, software developers, vendors and activists to figure out how to write choice (back) into the intricate internet of our daily life. As far as I understand, it goes a little something like this. \n\nPolicy makers, digital social innovators and regulators are trying to build mechanisms that link the identity of a person, thing, interaction, or environment with the act of choosing when and how to share that identity. Take for example the fact that even though I\u2019m 34, about half of the time I still get asked for ID when I enter a bar. And when I provide an ID card to prove my identity the bouncer ends up accessing not just my age but also my name, citizenship and birth place, address, gender, physical capabilities etc. Not only that, but more and more bars are choosing to scan and store this information in their database in case I \u201cmisbehave\u201d (and on follows a passionate debate between a bouncer and myself one evening this past Spring in Brixton). **The case for entitlements as I understand it, is that any identity should have the right to choose which pieces of information that make up that identity are relevant to share in each context.** Eg. here\u2019s my age, that\u2019s all you need friend. \n\nRight now, with the proliferation of \u201csmart governance\u201d and IoT it\u2019s not just human identities that need to be addressed. What happens when an autonomous driving car hits a smart lamppost that falls and burns down a heritage-listed forest that is the sacred site of the local indigenous people? For example. **Which follows that what constitutes an identity and how that identity is a) implicated in a situation and b) has rights in that situation is brought into wonderful and inspirational question.** \n\nNow I could go down the rabbit hole of identity politics right now and rest assured I\u2019ve spent some time in there. But I trust my allies working in anti-oppression movements and post-structuralist critical theory are doing fine work on that. Rather, I\u2019m drawn to how we translate the challenge of discrimination and biopolitical manipulation into a platform for agency via the background rooms designing and regulating entitlements. In these rooms sit people from all walks of life asking a fundamental question in the urgent context and fluctuating visibility of technological progress. **In all our quests for asserting basic human rights, we are at increasing risk that no matter who we are, the networked infrastructures of our daily lives are swiftly diminishing our autonomy.** \n\nAt the recent workshop lead by Rob van Kranenburg and Marta Arniani as a part of [NGI Move](https://www.ngi.eu/about/ngi-move/) where I was introduced to entitlements as a kind of _value layer_ above from the _data layer_, I found myself being drawn to the connections and dynamics between identities more than the identities themselves. It seems to me that a way to orient towards rights in a situation is to understand the impact that the situation\u2019s parts have on each other, enabling or hindering their agency. I began asking: What might happen when the dynamics of interacting identities involved in a situation becomes a kind of ledger? A kind of account of what happened from the situation itself in order to reveal the entangled impacts on each part. Could entitlements be based on another kind of classification system created by the dynamics and impacts of interacting identities, or parts of identities, rather than existing ones such as citizenship, age, preferences? Inspiration for this has come from, among other things, a workshop on the democratisation of financial tools with the Volatility Working Group, Economic Space Agency and Senselab at NYU and The New School in 2017; where I learned about how volatility in the financial sector is at its most simplest, _the production of new value by tracing and capturing the dynamics of change_. And so ensued an inspiring conversation on the dynamics of identities towards entitlements that ended up for me somewhere here. \n\n <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8ddad1edfb004c94ff5ad142b7e0f04174d8c938.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\">\n\n...\nWhen we shared our ideas to other colleagues towards the end of the workshop they rightly so were confused, and then simplified our proposition to the equation and coordinate system of:\n\n## x + y = z\n\n## \n\nAnd of course YES, in a way it\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s as simple as the outcome of one identity or identity-part interacting with another identity/ identity-part to create new entitlements. But the question for me then became \n\n_**what is + in this equation and what is = ?**_\n\nJust as we are being called to move beyond existing classifications of identity for inclusion and agency, I\u2019m not convinced that we can classify the interaction between identities towards entitlements in the same way we ever have. When reflecting on this with my mum, she hit the nail on the head: \u201cWe need new symbols.\u201d In other words, just as we are seeing gender neutral restrooms with neither a male nor a female symbol to welcome in the transfluid and gender-non-conforming, and just as we\u2019re extending on quantitative indicators of impact to qualitative; could it be time for a fresh and agile set of symbols responsive to the complex systems of today? **A kind of choose-your-own adventure for how I piece together the many parts of me.** \n\nBy now, of course we\u2019ve moved on from simple again, and how easy it can be to do so. But this is our challenge is it not? The art of co-creating simple, open and elegant infrastructures adaptable to the complexity of our becoming-futures. What\u2019s more, this is really just the beginning of a series of reflections bringing together my work in strategic partnerships across innovation, governance and development with my speculative research-creation practice. And it is shared in the spirit of thinking out loud to invite your and others\u2019 perspectives to join in this collaborative quest.\n\nLet me close then with some concreteness. Firstly to direct you to some allies already working hard on identity rights and management in the [DECODE project](https://www.decodeproject.eu/), providing \n\u201ctools that put individuals in control of whether they keep their personal information private or share it for the public good.\u201d Secondly, to some excerpts from Rob van Kranenburg\u2019s report on the entitlements workshop:\n\n> The first result is about language. Mental imaginaries surrounding new technologies are mainly negative. The participants proposed to move away from this terminology in Next Generation Internet, from security and surveillance to safeguarding democratic values, from notions of control in identity management to the framework that states that you can assert and assume your rights if you have a proper identity, from one single fixed identity to federated identities\u2026\n\n> The second result is a validation of the productive nature of the term \u2018Entitlement(s)\u2019. This is not yet defined formally and may not be for quite a while. At the moment it allows us to reflect about one of the key aspects of the Digital Transition: the fact that persons, goods, situations and interactions are all acquiring digital twins as they radiate data from their data bodies.\n\n> \u2026 The third result is a validation of the system approach that NGI proposes as Entitlements are linked directly to services and infrastructures, and as such to a new value layer that is independent of who hosts or has the data. \n\nAnd so here I find myself: amidst intersecting conversations and projects on entitlements, [#nextgengov](https://www.innovationdays.istanbul/#), [comment s'agir in afrofutures](https://www.racines.ma/), [networks of trust](https://www.meoh.io/) and so on\u2026 hearing loud and clear the call for new means of signification through encoded futures and towards autonomous wellbeing. Easier said than done of course, but that\u2019s why we have our collective intelligence.", "created_at": "2018-11-04 18:33:23.892994", "updated_at": "2018-11-05 15:39:30.607866", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1576, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 359.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86357, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 14556, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Hello Amelia and everyone, unfortunately, I have to skip today's meeting, as for the planned agenda \n1) @amelia call for ethnographers, I hope you received my answers via e-mail, I will resend it via ER as well just to make sure we got some 12 applications, some of them quite promising\n2) we did another round of code review with @SZdenek, finished the translations, so he will have some notes\n\nHope you are all doing fine, Jirka", "created_at": "2020-11-06 11:13:52.580220", "updated_at": "2020-11-06 11:13:52.580220", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 79, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85184], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8898, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1315, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>A little uneasy</b>\n\nThe story is great, Alessia... but still, I am a little uneasy.\n\nThe reason is this: mobilizing people <em>against </em>some change seems systematically easier than mobilizing them <em>for </em>some change.
