Mozda je i bude ali gledajuci razvoj situacije, sve vece zaduzivanje nasih zemalja i trend iseljavanja, vrlo je moguce da je nece biti ili ce biti manja od iznosa potrebnog za dostojan zivot.\nDoduse nije mi to ni u prirodi, ja sam preduzetnik pa ne trazim sigurnost vec nacin kako da se sto bolje prilagodim uredjenom haosu koji nas okruzuje i osiguram svoju dobrobit radeci nesto korisno i za druge :slight_smile: \n\nNe vjerujem da pitanje penzije, besplatnog ili jeftinog obrazovanja i zdravstva (a slazem se da su to sustinska pitanja) mozemo rijesiti a da prvo ne rijesimo pitanje sistema koji je trul do srzi.\nTaj sistem sluzi samo sebi i to cak ni sebi ne sluzi potpuno vec sluzi tudjim interesima zadovoljavajuci se mrvicama ispod stola.\n\nDa bi napredovao unutar sistema treba da budes sluga, iskorumpiran i kukavica itd.\nNa zalost svih nas, vjerovatno najgora posljedica postavljanja takvog sistema vrijednosti je sto to postaje normalno stanje drustva. Mijenja se svijest stanovnistva i, zbog takvog poremecenog sistema vrijednosti, postaje sve teze i teze napraviti promijene na bolje.\n\nZasto toliko ljudi odlazi iz Srbije, Hrvatske, Bosne? Najocigledniji razlog je naravno ekonomske prirode ali po meni neki od velikih razloga su:\n***Pogine nekome sestra, kcerka na semaforu zato sto je pregazio tatin sin koji za to nece odgovarati.\n\n***Ulaganje u sebe ne znaci puno ako posao dobije onaj sa najboljom vezom, a cak i da imas znanje mozes vrlo lako izgubiti svoje radno mjesto zato sto je potrebno nekome sa vezom.\n\n***Donose se kriminalni zakoni koji idu na stetu 95% stanovnistva i direktno uticu na tvoj kvalitet zivota.\n\n***Stite se kriminalci (danas se cesto nazivaju preduzetnicima) i radnici cesto u radnom odnosu ne dobijaju ni postovanje a kamoli korektnu placu.\n\n***Zelis otvoriti firmu i vrlo brzo shvatis da moras prekrsiti zakon da bi poslovao, a to znaci da ces placati reket ili te nece biti jer je sistem tako postavljen.\n\nJa bi rekao da je korupcija najveci neprijatelj napretka jednog naroda i generalno ljudske civilizacije, protivno je Darvinovoj teoriji evolucije i zdravom razumu. Nitko ne bi trebao biti na nekoj poziciji ako nije sposoban ostvariti doprinos firmi/zajednici/narodu/naciji ili ljudskoj civilizaciji.\nPosljedica korupcije je to da se smanjuje kvalitet u svakom aspektu zivota, ljudi se nalaze na pozicijama na kojima ne bi trebali biti dok drugi koji bi bili izuzetni na tim pozicijama rade nesto drugo, ne rade nista ili odlaze iz zemlje...a oni ce svojim kvalitetom doprinjeti drugim zajednicama, drzavama koje su stvorile povoljnije uvjete za njih.\n\nKao sto je @marina rekla, jedni daju kuverte i to im je nazalost normalno a drugi koji ne mogu funkcionirati u takvom sistemu odlaze...najveci izazov je promijeniti svijest ljudi.\nZastrasujuca stvar za mene je letargija koju vidim kad je u pitanju politika.

([p. 5](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=4))\n\n> We feel that unless we redirect our societal energies, we will be driving ourselves into a concrete wall of ecological, economic and social crisis. ([p. 11](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=7))\n\n> Today, commandos are directed through the battlefield with the help of real time camera feedback. Tomorrow, consumers will be steered through smart shopping malls based on their status updates and spending profiles. ([p. 15](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=9))\n\nThat's quite a good illustration of the very different scenarios that can be supported by IoT technology. The first is empowering (though only in support of current elites). The other is disempowering (as consumers are force-fed avoidable consumption goods by exploiting human psychological weaknesses with micro-targeted ads). At least in online shopping, the second scenario is reality already.\n\nI suppose what you're heading for is realizing an empowering scenario for \"ordinary citizens\" using IoT and IT technology. And I very much agree that there is a huge unexplored potential for that. To this date, I don't know of any existing system that would provide military-style \"jointness\" capabilities to citizens. If we had that around, and it would be in widespread use, it's hard to imagine the power that citizens would have with that. Perhaps the closest real-life demonstration was the Spanish Indignados movement and the Arab Spring, both largely organized via Twitter messages. But what a poor substitute microblogging is for a military-style jointness system. It's like I've heard once: \"You _can_ use a word processor software for everything, including writing a newspaper and organizing a revolution, but for most things there are much better tools for the job.\"\n\nWhile not the IoT angle directly, I have my own long-term interest in jointness software for civilians, including for grassroots movements and social organizing. (In [my final thesis](https://ma.juii.net/ma-documents/main/CommunityGroupware.Thesis.pdf) when studying computer science, I tried my hand at designing such a system. Not sure what value that thesis has in 2019, but yes, I have a history of interest in this stuff. :-) )\n\n> [M]ost people reading this pamphlet will see dramatic changes within their own lifetime [due to climate breakdown]. This gives us a short time frame to build novel types of technology that will support strong local relationships that make areas resilient in the face of impending global failure. [\u2026] It seems clear that the present centralized system will break down. We will have to build a post-oil network composed of Islands of Things, [\u2026] made up of local units of organization and production. ([p. 20](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=12))\n\nIt's amazing how similar that sounds to my vision of the [Autarkic City](/t/9141) :slight_smile: \n\n> There are moments when society is ready to act on a specific issue. ([p. 21](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=12))\n\nTotally agreed. With @natalia_skoczylas we witnessed this first-hand when we happened to be in Nepal during and right after the 2015 earthquakes. We even have a [small research paper](/t/4605) about volunteer disaster response from that time. But we also saw the limits of that grassroots action: it can get exhausted quickly (within weeks) by fulltime action because there is no external funder and people have to go back to their jobs. And it cannot adequately deal with problems that require large investments and infrastructure.\n\nSo if we want a successful grassroots response to climate breakdown, we need one that takes these limits into account. I am not too sure yet, but I think that action on the demand side will be more effective than directly fighting against greenhouse gas emitting big industries. Think a grassroots movement converting society towards being carbon negative, one house at a time.\n\nWhat I have not (yet) found in your paper is a concrete vision of how a self-governed Internet of People society would look like. What tech, what software, what forms of social organization might it use? It's still a bit of an abstract vision to me. (Admittedly I am going into the other extreme \u2026 my visions tend to take the form of lists of equipment, and of course society won't implement it like that \u2026)\n\n> Extending this Cuban example, the Russian anarchist Kropotkin offers a powerful vision of production through small-scale physical workshops, which in the Internet of People brings together low and high-tech bike repair and sensor networks. [\u2026] \n> \n> This model of local workshops allows people to do a variety of work, some manual, some intellectual, some exciting and some less so. If we produce things in our local area, we get fulfillment from our multiple roles of manual work as well as empowering brainwork and will not need \u201chobbies\u201d anymore. The Internet of People enables a vision of globally interconnected workshops that change the type of things we produce, as well as our social and cultural relations in which we do so. ([p. 26](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=15))\n\nI think this is such a 2011 thing to say :-) 2011 was prime time for low-cost FDM 3D printers, for [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org) with their vision of an open source civilization, and so on. It felt hopeful, and I like the memory. And whil I still stick to that vision of an open source and collaborative world \u2013 the local manufacturing revolution turned out to be way more difficult to start than we imagined in 2011 \u2026\n\nIn my view of today, that is largely because people are locked into the mainstream economy of with its price competition and the resulting winner-takes-all mass production by the current money system and by the huge needs for money that are not simple to replace with \"local production\" in the sense of self-supply, as it needs economic exchange. For the urban population, that is mostly rent. And as and while (1) money is scarce for much of the population and (2) prices of non-locally-produced item (read: from China) are cheaper, people are locked into the mainstream economy for the time being.\n\nRecognizing this resulted (for me and a co-founder) into another startup called PayCoupons that aims to replace money in the local economy with algorithmic network bartering, to unlock local production in a space protected from global competition over price alone. More about that [here](https://blog.pay.coupons/e0b203f350fc).\n\nBut starting that kind of marketplace in Europe while the economy is officially \"well\" is difficult. As dark as that sounds, we'll need another economic crisis before a tool like that will get the attention it deserves.\n\n> In the coming years, [\u2026] [the IoT Council] can advise governments and institutions on how to transform into interconnected workshops. ([p. 30](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=17))\n\nI like that vision of interconnected workshops :) Has there been practical progress on proposed standards for distributed manufacturing in the years since the publication of the 2011 pamphlet?\n\nIn particular, I am interested in standards for versioned, collaborative development of designs for physical items, including dependency management between them. It would be \"like [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for physical products\" and \"like a software [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system) for installing designs of products\".\n\nWith that in place, it's not far fetched to automatically or semi-automatically feed this into CNC machines or a flexible manufacturing system like [CubeSpawn](https://cubespawn.com/).\n\nBut so far, I don't know of any practical standard for this kind of data exchange. There has been [SKDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n39RK4inzg), [VOICED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOICED) and now [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/), but none of it is usable for its stated purpose so far. I am always tempted to just create that standard myself, package the first 100 existing open hardware projects in the format, and see if it will catch on \u2026\n\n> We exist in complex relationships with our environment simply by living our everyday lives. If we would get feedback on how we feel and how we might feel better, how our talents could get recognized, how we could relate better to our neighbors, then having sensors and actuators make sense. ([p. 37](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=20))\n\nI guess is this is where our visions for the future start to differ. My vision, with its focus on autarky-enhancing technology, is to _reduce_ the complexity of the modern environment to something manageable. Complexity to be managed by an end user will actually rise as people will have to learn a lot of new and strange tech. But most of the hidden and uncontrollable dependencies from external entities of a mass society will vanish, this way putting citizens back in control of their lives and wellbeing.\n\n> Proximity [\u2026] In the future Internet of People, we will have to rely much more on our immediate environment for support. We are already linked to our neighbors with power and water but in the future we may have to rely on them for growing food and making things. What we are really talking about is a kind of mutual responsibility that we might call solidarity. ([p. 42](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=23))\n\nI read this as a high-tech reincarnation of the village-based economies that existed in central Europe until about 1960, and that still exist in many parts of the world, including villages in Nepal that I visited. Good solutions come back when unsustainable forms of social organization end :slight_smile:\n\nIf only there was a way to persuade villagers in Nepal that the system they have is good to begin with and that they just need to add some tech to make everything more efficient, safe and comfortable. No need to break the whole structure of society down in the name of \"progress\", just to come back to the same roots decades later.\n\n> This will leave our environment and us with an amorphous mass of data to make sense of. It\u2019ll also bring about new identities for things. What are our tools for sense making at the moment? [\u2026] We want everybody to be able to draw on the largest and most available amount of data. [I]t will also create new forms of decision making for large groups of people and small communities on the basis of newly available data. ([p. 47](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=25))\n\nWhile I don't have  much of an opinion about big data, other than that it's useful for scientists and others with the time and skills to analyze it adequately, here's a complementary perspective that needs IoT devices as well, and right now.\n\nLet's call it \"tiny data\". In the highly resilient society of the future, we'll have to rely on local resources much more than now. This can be a city-level or neighborhood-level micro-grid or an off-grid house, or probably all of these to have multiple levels of redundancy. I am personally living off-grid and from that experience I can tell that good monitoring of ones energy, water, wastewater, heating and cooling systems is essential for wise resource use and proper functioning. For example, I know that I need 500-700 Wh of photovoltaics energy a day, and that I can cope with at most 10 days of gray sky in winter. That's where IoT comes in. Network-connected sensors and an evaluation software would combine local consumption data and weather forecasts into behavior recommendations.\n\nFor an energy system using this kind of technology for monitoring, demand management, \"energy solidarity\" and other purposes, I [published some notes](/t/9731/6) in an earlier treat we were having here in the IoH forum. No such thing exists on the market today.\n\n> The total overview is impossible. [\u2026] It is the communal and participatory uncovering of the machinery that administers \u201carea construction,\u201d which creates what I call system thinking. System thinking is the personal and communal awareness that all things are connected in multiple networks of agency. It thus creates a space for multiple intelligences to form new kinds of awareness. ([p. 48](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=26))\n\nAgain, let me introduce a complementary perspective: systems engineering. Indeed, we may not be able to ever uncover or understand in whole how our world or local environment works. But instead of accepting this as \"a feature and not a bug\", the other option is to reconstruct the world, including the technosphere and social relations, to conform to principles of good systems engineering (hiding of complexity, public and private interfaces, reusability, redundancy and so on). A too complex world is an engineering failure \u2013 because too much social complexity is the main risk for societal collapse in the face of an arising resource shortage (as per [Joseph A. Tainter: The Collapse of Complex Societies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AOZ3PM)).\n\nWhat I have discovered in my various explorations of and experiments with autarky-enhancing technology is that this is a largely unexplored area with a high potential for creating a resilient and sustainable civilization with modern comforts and only the essential complexity. This is certainly no silver bullet as there will not be total autarky on the household or city level in the foreseeable future. I'm mentioning it as a complementary approach to the problem of complexity: instead of only using better mental models to understand it and deal with it, we can also discard it and \"start from scratch\".\n\n**Summary:** the last part of the book, \"[Sociability Standards for the Internet of People](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=28)\", is a good summary of the design guidelines developed throughout that document (also good for everyone interested to join the discussion but needing a _tl;dr_). Summing up my comments by going along that list:\n\n* **Proximity:** I see that as an essential property of resilience and economic fairness in a future society, and it fits right in with my own notion of local autarky and PayCoupons, our innovation for local economic exchange. Proximity and local production should not be confused with anti-globalization: all knowledge should be globalized, for proper global collaboration. So it's rather in the realm of alter-globalization.\n\n* **System Thinking:** Above, I proposed systems engineering as a complementary approach to system complexity, and a local and fully circular economy (\"autarky\") as a possible outcome. I like the practical proposals though, esp. \"Systems that automatically generate a fixed, public discussion url for each item.\". That would be a good entry point to share user-generated knowledge about using an item / type of product, to report issues and contribute to its development in an open source manner, and to interface with a lending system, second hand offers of the product etc..\n\n* **Affect:** That's really interesting to me as it shows a gap in my designs for local autarky so far. I have no idea though what kind of changes could incorporate a space for emotions and conflict into local autarky tech \u2013 I might not be the right person to have that idea, but then somebody else will be.", "created_at": "2019-07-10 16:57:37.878307", "updated_at": "2019-07-11 09:40:09.566831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2719, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 194.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 5, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56436], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32395, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3706, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Being \"connected\" beyond being within line of sight.</b>\n\n...Not about prestige. It's being aware of what is not always visible.\u00a0 Just being within line of sight is not being \"connected\".\n\nWhen we did workshops this spring in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia everyone kept pointing out that a key problem was lack of collaboration. It turns out\u00a0 people who you would think would be connected because they work on similar or related things/care about same issues, live in the same city, are part of the same generation etc didn't even know of one another, let alone collaborate. And a large chunk of that reason is that it takes a lot of work to create contexts which people find, and where we come together, interact and discover what we have in common. For that to then coalesce into action/collaboration requires a lot of coordination and \"open\" community building which people very busy don't want to do unless they see immediate benefits to their own projects.\n\nActually you and I are a perfect example. We went to the same school at the same time and lived in the same city at the same time for many years. In all that time we never really interacted let alone worked together. We find ourselves here because a context was created which had us interact around topics of mutual interest. And opportunities built for us to meet and spend time thinking and working together.\u00a0 Edgeryders has played a large role in this and continues to do so. This is not about branding. It matters because even though putting resources into bringing people together is clearly so valuable you have to work and fight for it continuously. Let's not undermine our ability to do more of this by downplaying the role of network weaving and coordination when it has been and is important. We need to continuously acknowledge and highlight the importance of that work and those opportunities so they are made accessible to many others. And so the people who do work to create them are not disincentivised by lack of acknowledgement.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-30 10:17:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.002935", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 363, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32333], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38235, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 6396, "post_number": 40, "raw": "Got some methylene blue powder in an eppendorf tube now, to bring with me, just in case you don't find any easily!  \nCan you please make an official invitation with letterhead and signature that requests me to come to this event, just in case I get any trouble at the airport???

We don't want to grant people the title unMonasterian by way of free goodies. It cannot be a recruitment tool, because each person joining an unMonastery will be a crucial part of the small community in the house (not one of the nameless members of a 2000+ platform), and the commitment to make it work requires that each person is deeply dedicated to making that particular group function well and to the work to the host community (or leave). It is a real responsibility. It has to be a considered decision. The uniform is to signal that kind of commitment, both to each other and to the host city. It cannot be a marketing tool.\n\nMaybe a compromise is possible?

Do not assume everyone consents with your interpretation, by labelling it under the same brand.</span>\n\n<span>One solution I see, and I repeat it here, is to call your own projects with its own names - which eventually can use Edgeryders as an adjective in complement to it, as to understand its origins.</span>\n\n<span>If you label your own projects by assuming I am part of it, it makes it more difficult for me ( and others ). \u00a0This can easily be resolved through enabling specific\u00a0name tags for\u00a0your specific projects,</span>\n\n<span>which do not imply involvement from others who may not agree with it.</span>\n\n<span>I brought forward my points. I hope you will read them again and understand them.</span>\n\n<span>Although I could also understand there may be an interest for some to not enable such definition, as it maintains a implicit power framework over all projects who would end up being induced in using the same brand,</span>\n\nconverging this power in the hands of some representants. \u00a0 I beileve it is unhealthy to have representants, unless I decide for it.\n\n<span>Perhaps some people tend to rush into signing contracts and engagements with others before understanding them - I prefer not.</span>\n\n<span>I notice you are engaged into defining stuff - related to your current needs and focus. That is fine. Though for the sake of scalability,</span>\n\n<span>I made the simple suggestion of being able to differentiate who's project is who's project, who is involved and consents to it, by basing each\u00a0on different names, as each may\u00a0potentially have differing objectives.</span>\n\n<span>This means not using Edgeryders as a uniform overlapping and potentially enclosing\u00a0brand, but rather use Edgeryders as an additional adjective.</span>\n\n<span>My proposal may requestion in itself the power structures of Edgeryders, and hopefully it skims off the potential use of Edgeryders in public relations, preventing representants to make use of such brand in their own interests. \u00a0 I have seen this all too often in a variety of organizations, and prefer to avoid it here.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-05 18:03:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.318705", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 611, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30578], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84585, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14424, "post_number": 8, "raw": "After watching a few examples, this is the type of multiple topic long-form post that I feel does not lead to a lot of conversation.

Bolje je biti stranac u bilo kojoj od tih zemalja nego gradjanin zemlje, sto je nevjerojatno. Volio bi da je to zato sto smo tako susretljivi i puni gostoprimstva ali u stvari razlog je taj da se oni kriminalci na vlasti plase naljutiti strane vlade a i ne postuju svoje gradjane.\n\n- Ako naidjes na sposobnu osobu koja razmislja van standardnih okvira sve je moguce.

Rekli su mi da ce mi to biti samo trosenje energije ali ja sam svejedno gurao i nije islo. Korupcija, lazi i prevare...cak je bilo i pokusaja da me ubjede uraditi neke stvari preko seksa. Ljudi cesto razmisljaju kako kratkorocno nesto zaraditi, ne razmislja se na duze staze. Bolje prevariti nekoga i okrenuti brzu lovu nego ulagati u zdrave poslovne odnose.

Svake godine dobijem novu ideju i krenem istrazivati trziste/uslove u Srbiji. \n\nU sljedecih par godina sve moje poslovne i dobrotvorne aktivnosti su vezane za Hrvatsku. Iz Srbije cu mozda uvoziti materijale/sirovine i ako bude moguce ( za sad jos nisam nasao dovoljno visok kvalitet proizvodnje) proizvoditi sve drustvene igre koje izdamo. \nDoduse ja cu se potruditi odvojiti vremena i energije za bilo kakvu inicijativu vezanu za dobrobit svih nas i u Hrvatskoj i u Srbiji.\n\nKlima u Hrvatskoj je bolja za mene(i postace jos bolja) za pilot projekte ali ako se projekat pokaze uspjesnim u Hrvatskoj ja cu ga rado ponoviti u Srbiji ili podijeliti iskustvo da ga netko drugi ostvari u Srbiji...i vice versa bi se trebalo primjeniti :slight_smile: .

Some of which we ask you to develop with us, some of which we question critically and some of which we discuss how to break and decentralise.*\n\n## A structure to definitely break:\n\nTo start, due to current yet systemically ingrained and therefore well too long ongoing events, we would like to ask you to check out this post by our own @amelia about how to support the movements against police brutality and systemic racism.\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794\n\n## A structure we want to build to be more independent from commercial structures:\n\nTo be more independent from commercial social media and have another direct connection to our wider community, we now have an Ederyders telegram channel. To connect it with the platform we would like to develop our chatbot \u201cAlice\u201d further.\n\n**Are you interested in joining in helping to develop Alice?**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/lets-talk-about-alice-and-how-to-have-a-good-conversation-with-and-edgeryders-chat-bot/13842\n\n## A proposed structure that needs critical feedback:\n\n**How does \u201c[The Future of Internet Governance](https://schmud.de/posts/2020-06-06-internet-governance.html)\u201d look like?** On of our community members has attended the United Nations\u2019 Secretary-General [High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation](https://digitalcooperation.org/) and provides us not only with a summary and schematic, but also with critical questions:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818\n\n## A proposed structure for decentralization research:\n\n\"A growing number of technologists are challenging the consolidation of power over digital information systems by creating decentralized protocols and applications. Where government and corporate control are causing harm, decentralized technologies can bring about autonomy, resilience, and equity.\u201d\n\n**What stories and ideas do you have regarding the 7 maxims and areas of research for decentralisation development presented here?**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-do-decentralization-research-findings-7-maxims/13822\n\n## An animation that lets you see the IOH community structure grow over time:\n\nLast week we presented you the first animation of Edgeryders overall network development. This week we are excited about the first detailed animation of the growth of the IOH/NGI Community. **Which pattern chan you see?**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/visualizing-the-growth-of-the-ngi-exchange-debate/13807\n\n## Is there a structural difference between open source and proprietary code?\n\nThe EU Code icebreaker week did not mention opensource development in their agenda at all and this reignited the conversation in this thread. **Do you think that open source as code has a differentiator from proprietary code. If not, which values do think it adds?** https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881/137\n\n## Job opportunity:\n\nWe would like to bring another job opportunity to your attention that comes through the community. **Do you want to work with a community-friendly edtech startup?**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/community-friendly-edtech-startup-you/13853\n\n### Finally, what\u2019s next with the \u201cMaking a livelihood\u201d summit?\n\nAnd invite you to the next presummit listening session: On the 22nd of June we will bring together knowledge workers and policymakers in higher education, also allying with unions and rights defenders, with their histories of mobility, migration and refuge. **How can we make a living after years of studying?**\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414\n\nWe are merging the conversation also with this thread to ask even more critically, **How can we avoid the further bullshitisation of academic work?**\n\n[https://edgeryders.eu/t/paid-duct-taping-vs-unpaid-creation/13597/](https://edgeryders.eu/t/paid-duct-taping-vs-unpaid-creation/13597/11)\n\n*Thank you for being here, you are a great community and support structure, on different levels and in a decentralised manner ;)*", "created_at": "2020-06-10 22:19:08.189809", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 07:30:36.556197", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 646, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 68.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [78285, 78633, 78447, 78522, 78402, 78715, 75688], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6400, 5485], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2966, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2933, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In <a href=\"/georgias-futurespotters/bi-weekly-meeting-nr-1-summary\">this discussion</a>, we started playing with the idea of developing a Horizon 2020 project as a way to enhance collaboration across Georgian NGOs. <span>In the same discussion, <a href=\"/u/inge\">@Inge</a>\u00a0mentioned the goal of getting more Georgian to adopt free-and-open software instead of illegally downloaded proprietary software.\u00a0</span>\u00a0Later on, we held another futurespotters workshop in Cairo, and sure enough they came up with the problem that Egyptian NGOs don't collaborate either.\n\nI was thinking that the H2020 project could be about open source software and digital literacy.

Yet, we are making progress but we still need to get more people with us to ensure a high-quality curriculum. Meanwhile, with the help of the ZINDI community, we have decided to start building an offline community so we can get more people involved (who may join the academy as participants or as team members).\n\n**About the event**\n\nThe event aims to develop and strengthen the IA community in Tunisia we are organizing a one-day hackathon to solve a real environmental challenge in an African country.\n\nThe event will be held at the Higher School of Communication of Tunis Sup\u2019com, a school of national elites.\n\nThe event is open to all university students and professionals that have a passion for solving environmental problems with technology.\n\n**The Challenge**\n\nThe objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to help non-profit organization [Local Ocean Conservation](http://localocean.co/) to predict the number of turtles that will be captured at each site each day to help local Ocean prepare better and allocate their human and material resources more efficiently\n\nThe challenge will be hosted at the Zindi platform.\n\n**About Local Ocean Conservation (LOC)** ([localocean.co](http://localocean.co/))\n\nLOC is a private, not-for-profit organization committed to the protection of Kenya\u2019s marine environment. LOC supports the communities and coastal areas in Watamu and Diani, Kilifi County with marine conservation and community development projects \u2013 centered around a holistic approach to conservation.

Pitanje koje odzvanja u meni od kad znam za sebe jeste :\" KAKO I\u0160TA MO\u017dE DA POSTOJI U NE\u010cEMU \u0160TO NEMA NI PO\u010cETAK NI KRAJ(UNIVERZUM)?\"\nI sada dok ovo pi\u0161em, po ko zna koji put sam se zamislila.\nPostojimo u galaksiji u kojoj ima oko 250 milijardi zvezda poput na\u0161eg Sunca. Svaka zvezda ima neki sistem koji je okru\u017euje. Galaksija poput ove na\u0161e ima oko 200 milijardi. Pro\u010ditajte jo\u0161 jednom ove 3 re\u010denice i zamislite to. Zvu\u010di nelogi\u010dno. Nemogu\u0107e. Sme\u0161no. Nerealno. Toliko jasno vidim ovu stolicu, ovaj zid, mogu i da ih dodirnem, a Univerzum zvu\u010di vi\u0161e kao neka ma\u0161ta, apstrakcija. A njegov smo deo. Sve ovo u nekoj apstrakciji!? (Kola\u010d u tiganju!?) Nemogu\u0107e!!\nSve ovo \u0161to ja sada pro\u017eivljavam, sve emocije, stres, problemi, bitka, ljubav, materijalne stvari- sve je deo nekog beskraja!? Onda sve to nema nikakvog smisla! \u0160ta je onda va\u017eno? Na \u0161ta da se fokusiram?\nNa ono mesto ispod grudnog ko\u0161a, \"ono\" mesto. Jedino \u0161to deluje jako stvarno jer je stalno tu. Jedino njega stalno nosimo sa sobom i ose\u0107amo ga konstantno. Ooo kako ga samo nekad ose\u0107amo!! Kad bi mogli samo 10 minuta da ga sklonimo, da sami sebi olak\u0161amo. \nNe treba da znate ni ko je premijer, ni gde ja \u017eivim, ni koliko je gram zlata danas na berzi. Jedini fokus treba da vam bude \"ono\" mesto i sve \u0161to ima veze s njim. Treba svake sekunde da budete svesni da sami ispunjavate \"ono\" mesto i da, realno, postojati na nekoj ta\u010dkici me\u0111' 200 milijardi galaksija zvu\u010di kao \u010dista magija!\nKonstantno se pri\u010da o nekim promenama i kako mi to moramo pod hitno da sprovedemo. Promene i ovoga i onoga. Svetu, planeti i civilizaciji je potrebno to, svi to ose\u0107amo, ali odakle po\u010deti? Gde su ti koji znaju kako po\u010deti?\nSmatram da \u0107e do promena do\u0107i spontano onda kada svako od nas bude postao svestan \"onog\" mesta i kako sa njim. Kada svi shvate da imaju potpunu slobodu da tu stave, skladi\u0161te \u0161ta god \u017eele. Nema uslova. \nSvi i \u017eele da menjaju sebe i svoju realnost ali ne znamo kako. A ne znamo ne zato \u0161to je nemogu\u0107e ili te\u0161ko ve\u0107 zato \u0161to nas niko nije nau\u010dio o tome. U\u010dili smo da fokus stavljamo na okru\u017eenje. Jednostavno ne znamo. Ta mudrost kojim se veliki umovi slu\u017ee ve\u0107 vekovima i trude se da je prenesu je i dalje marginalizovana i pod velom misticizma. Od Tesle smo uzeli njegove izume ali ne i njegove mudre re\u010di koje su zapravo bile uputstvo za upotrebu njegovih vizija i izuma. I zaista, daleko smo dogurali! Vidi \u0161ta smo sve napravili!! \nAli gde smo?\nI dalje u beskraju. \nAli izgubljeni. Oti\u0161li smo daleko i idemo sve dalje. Ali ne znamo gde smo po\u0161li uop\u0161te.\nZovem se Tamara.

This one as well, if client is happy with it, will be developed further and turned into a polished logo. This logo will then be delivered as standalone element to be used on any other project. \nSame goes for the main visual and deliverables. \nLet me know if you have any question.\n\nI gave him the [event concept idea](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-economic-science-fiction-seminar-brussels-november-11th/10794), the [solarpunk art](https://www.google.com/search?q=solarpunk&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ACYBGNRIfSnHZy8p1GrxlnHsHkqd9wzShA:1569925706341&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjShLOA7frkAhVRExoKHUoUCbkQ_AUIESgB&biw=1280&bih=584) and the cover of \"[Walkaway](https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/)\" as references. \n\nSo, this is the draft visual concept:\n\n![1|487x690](upload://byyCTaLfu5ZudtiMWfmMo0j9if3.jpeg) \n\nI showed the picture to @augusto and we agreed on a few feedback we can give to Lorenzo.\n\n1. As we intend to have a participatory event (a lab), where basically two different worlds meet to talk about the future, one single human figure wouldn't represent the dialogue. So we suggest to represent at least the two worlds - science fiction and economy - and that could be done through human figures but also in a more conceptual way.\n\n1. It would be better to have the event name written in full. The proposed logo is what you see on the top left of the image. I already told this to Lorenzo, but he suggested, in his experience, that a logo with long words doesn't work. So we previously agreed on what you see: SciFi Econ Lab. But with @augusto we agreed also that \"Econ\" could be misleading.\n\n1. We decided to give Lorenzo a moodboard with some more images to be inspired by. We need your contribution for this too. \n\nAlso, we have to keep in mind that we gave him a very short time (15 days) and a limited budget (1k), so [by contract](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Cve7gcDP1ZEgwJAk51qV__4R8V5fiZHE) they will propose us up to 2 sketch options for the main project visual. The main visual will dictate all other deliverables.

Rather, I was pointing out to a social network problem: a local social network will only work if enough _local_ people  use it for it not to be an empty space. Until we went together to the matchmaking event in Stockholm, I had never had the pleasure to fire up Patchwork and see SSB users on my local network. People were taking screenshots, which means it does not happen often to others, either. \n\nIn Belgium we have a hyperlocal social network called [Hoplr](https://www.hoplr.com/About). When you sign up, you have to add your address, and they check that you really live where you say you live. You then are added to the same database as everyone else, but you can only see, and interact with, people that live in your same neighborhood. And neighborhoods are small, at least in Brussels: they use a statistical unit called _quartier_, of which there are 145 in the city (1.3 million inhabitants). I am a member for my _quartier_, but the activity is not enough to sustain a real conversation, even through \"the Internet\". My corner of Hoplr has defaulted to a kind of hard-to-search Craigslist, with people selling used furniture and the like. \n\nOf course, local Hoplr and local SSB could be socially great, if everyone used it. But not everyone will adopt them until they are socially great, so we are stuck. The pubs solution makes SSB viable for me, but it would not be possible without \"the Internet\".", "created_at": "2019-05-16 07:02:57.310737", "updated_at": "2019-05-16 07:02:57.310737", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 45.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [53308, 53492], "is_reply_to": [53308, 53492], "is_liked_by": [5040, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19810, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2286, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Thats funny, I'm K</b>\n\nOn top of that we have an education project.

change is only the final outcome of a social and economic model analyzed by Max Weber in its bureaucratic, formally rational structure, as well as by Karl Marx and the Frankfurt School. The quest for jobs, social positions, money and possessions has become the very essence of economic growth and of our notion of welfare, making us forget that these are only instruments, means for achieving some goals and for pursuing values.\n\nCapitalism implies the need for most individuals and companies to compete with others in order to have access to money, via labour and productive capital. This fact alone implies that values, meaning notions of good and bad, useful or useless, are always subordinated to what one does for a living. If we add to this picture the hyperspecialisation of professions and division of labor, the set of values that a company or an individual stands for is very limited.\n\nTherefore, our societies are not communities. As most individuals and companies know that their notion of good is only confined to their particular interest, there is no incentive to compare values, to change them, to spread them. The only tool that society has to reach an overall agreement is represented by elections (in order to decide who will hold power) and consumer choices (in order to decide who will have money).\n\nThe very destruction of the basic prerequisite for human existence (i.e. nature) is only the \u201cnatural\u201d consequence of a system where the basic prerequisite for the existence of a community is missing: the ability to choose values as something more than a mere consequence of one\u2019s role in the social fabric.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a market for values would offer the chance to get utility and profit not from the mere exchange of objects and reified, limited, atomistic social functions, like in today\u2019s markets. A market for values would make it possible to get utility and profit from one\u2019s holistic, freely chosen relation with society and human nature as a whole. There would be an economic incentive to choose values, before determining one\u2019s social function.\n\nIn a nutshell, cities (and other local communities), companies and individuals would be able to exchange their experiences highlighting the benefits of principles such as environmentalism, social justice and inclusivity.\n\nIt would be possible to exchange documents, each of which would list the experiences referred to a given value. Those would be certified on the basis of quantitative indicators, decided by law (at the national level) or international agreement, such as a given reduction in CO2 emissions (for companies), a given increase in green areas (for local communities) and a given amount of donations to green charities (for individuals) in the case of environmentalism. Indicators referred to social justice may include a given reduction in wage dispersion (in companies) and in Gini index (in local communities).\n\nThe price of a document would be proportional to the number of experiences listed in it, and the price of the experiences referred to each value would be determined by demand and supply. Each document would be exchangeable with others referred to other values, as well as with goods and services.\n\nThe economic incentive to take part in these transactions would be the possibility to resell a document at a price higher than the purchase price, which would be possible thanks to adding new experiences - after having freely chosen the kind of quantitative target to be pursued - and to a possible increase in the price of the experiences.", "created_at": "2019-11-06 18:52:14.233258", "updated_at": "2019-11-13 00:01:14.789181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1430, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 57.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53537, "user_id": 5015, "topic_id": 9802, "post_number": 20, "raw": "I would be happy to be on the list even though at the moment there are too many things going on and I'm having a hard time focusing on this subject, might organize myself better soon and explore it more...\n\nI bet @Andrusha would also be interested in collaborating <3\n\nbtw, I also heard recently about http://pjodd.se/ from from this %P9i5KKgtlzPR3ybqrvyCAdGoAGtwa+PHckimUYNyjaE=.sha256 @zelf, it might be also relevant to you", "created_at": "2019-05-15 14:20:58.509543", "updated_at": "2019-05-15 14:20:58.509543", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 74, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 35.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53490], "is_liked_by": [5040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74659, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13249, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[quote=\"andreja, post:1, topic:13249\"]\n**Eligible consortia** must include at least three different regional or local public administration (such as municipality, city, region, etc.) from three different EU Member States or countries.\n[/quote]\n\nNadia and I discussed this today.

The story, as it goes on there, is: local authorities are the closest to the needs of the citizen. Issues should be dealt with at a local level whenever possible. They call this \"the subsidiarity principle\", and it is a cornerstone of the whole European project. Your story is about subsidiarity in reverse: yes, local authorities are indeed close to the need of\u00a0<em>some</em>\u00a0citizens. They care a lot about real estate developers, for example. But the kids in Librino? Those kids are far down the priority list. They need to ally themselves with somebody that can say \"no\" to the local bigshots. There is no one that can do that in Catania. In Rome, or Brussels, that becomes possible, because Catania bigshots have very little political clout there. This makes a very clear case for the national and European levels of government to get more involved in local issues, especially now that they can engage in conversation with local citizens through the Internet.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2009/02/05/serve-ancora-il-principio-di-sussidiarietado-we-really-need-the-subsidiarity-principle-anymore/\">I called for a rethinking of the principle of subsidiarity in 2009</a>.

Multiple overlapping communities are working on the platform to understand and solve problems. A vital part of this work is to invite new stories and perspectives, and to do so we want to create a simpler and more welcoming first contact with our communities. Our way of engaging people revolves around asking open questions relating to the subject matter we are exploring. \n\nOur new on-boarding interface is a questionnaire where the answers get posted to edgeryders.eu, and the user would then automatically claim that content as their own when they registered on edgeryders.eu. \n\nWe are building the first version of it to be used on a tablet at the Biennale of Design in Ljubljana on November 14th. To leave some time for testing, the deadline to have the interface ready is November 1st. \n\n###  Project scope\n\nEdgeryders have already built the API which creates a user on edgeryders.eu with a given email and makes a post on that users behalf. This API is described in the Edgeryders API documentation, under [3.4. Multisite account creation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/using-the-edgeryders-eu-apis/7904#heading--3-4). \n\nThis brief is for creating a fully client-side javascript form  which collects:\n\n * A users email\n * Responses to a number of questions from a user\n * Some additional but voluntary data\n\nIt then should then:\n\n * Compile answers to questions into a Discourse post\n * Request a new account to be created with user email\n * Make post with compiled answers on edgeryders.eu as new user\n\nRequirements:\n\n * Design of the app [is shown here](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/95f23f10c7805de4f17f65649259110f494c8377.pdf), and shows how it should look on a tablet. This design shows the actual questions that should be asked and all relevant copy.\n * App should follow the flow and logic described in API documentation\n * App should follow error handling recommendations and display relevant error messages when they are returned from API and advice user on how to proceed\n * Once post has been submitted, app should show the account summary as described on \n * App should be completely client-side and any code running server side, except for hosting.\n * App must be delivered by November 1st.", "created_at": "2019-10-01 12:20:10.192685", "updated_at": "2019-10-01 12:20:10.192685", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58349, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 103, "raw": "I wrote [the API specs](/t/-/9202#heading--2-2-posting) for the custom API extension required to support this feature.

Since we are in touch on so many other channels, when you think there are standing issues, do not let me know by complaints during meetings. Communication, I am sure we agree, is more than leaving a post here. I understand you try to get the processes visible, but pinging me won't hurt ;)\n\nI am not sure I understand your question.\n\nThere should be no scenario in which the user has just read the policies and agreed to it after the launch of the funnel. This could have only happened before the funnel, now the process is explicit and this state does not occur.\n\nConcerning the \"disagreeing awareness\", from a formal point of view it is not really a necessity: you have to be sure that those who did not fullfill\u00a0the criteria for consent are not exposed to the \"risk\" of sharing their data on the platform. That is already respected by the current procedure, which forbids to proceed unless\u00a0all answers were given (including the consent).\n\nIf for statistical purposes (profiling your users, reporting some metrics about the impact of the new funnel -but do you have the sample size to claim this scope?-, ...) you would like to distinguish between the status of those who gave a negative response, and those who gave up answering, I imagine you would have to collect further data as well to make this distinction meaningful (did they leave half way because they found a show-stopper information? Or did they leave because they were not willing to engage in the funnel and they favoured the \"don't care, click and move on\" approach? Did they experience technical issues? ...?)\n\nAs stated earlier in a few of our conversations on-\u00a0and off-line, the web platform is something shared with the consortium by the Edgeryders Ltd. We provided a module as a best effort (our task was to design and document the funnel, not to implement it), and were told we overshoot by adapting an existing module to our needs (a proof of our lack of expertise on Drupal, which is not something we use).\u00a0We are not going to commit to any further\u00a0back-end maintenance for the platform, which we never included in our proposal. But we are willing to assist you in designing processes and questions if you need it, of course.\n\nMarco\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-23 08:55:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.309645", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 435, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23281], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61876, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10962, "post_number": 36, "raw": "Final visuals with original files https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RGrPMej4BumMT8vf2IU9LIhy0K7qxcEV", "created_at": "2019-10-21 21:19:33.957004", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 21:19:44.949919", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48013, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9116, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7c424f7f2311e52124eed970e341fc7bea51382b.jpg\"  width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n\nhttps://youtu.be/G_DoEa3lcBE\n\nBack in 2012, we watched in amazement as the original Edgeryders experiment unfolded, and a global community came together to share experiences and hacks to survive and thrive as the Great Recession ravaged the world. Every day we marveled at the courage, ingenuity and generosity of peer-to-peer communities, all the more impressive as world leaders and business seemed incapable of envisioning a way forward. We were in love with these people, and with their \u2013 our \u2013 collective intelligence. \n\nSo we started a company to fund the infrastructure to keep the community together, and to grow it. It was our way to contribute. Soon, organizations with interesting problems started showing up at our door. What are the emergent trends in social innovation in country X? What do young people in country Y really want? What is going to be the next social shift? And just like that, we were in business. We had connected this massive, hackerish, anarchic, radical, \"distributed think tank\" with established institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank, and UNESCO. \n\nAs the community grew and the company developed, however, we felt the need for more sophisticated tools to harvest the wealth of ideas, perspective and intelligence. We were just scratching the surface \u2013 and, frankly, the sheer numbers of contributors and of their contributions was starting to overwhelm us. We could only do well on the market because the competition sets a low bar.\n\n**We felt a need to go deeper.** In collective intelligence, new ideas and models emerge. But we individual humans are not good at perceiving emergence. We think in stories; someone makes a witty remark that triggers an \"aha\" moment, and that remark stays with us. Our cognitive processes zoom right in on it, tuning out the richness of alternative perspective and ideas and reducing a rich array of position to a few soundbites. To keep our own cognitive biases in check, we needed a solid methodology, that ensures reproducibility of results even with qualitative analysis. \n\n**We turned to research.** Our first research project, called [OpenCare](https://opencare.cc), started in 2016. It allowed us to develop a method based on a combination of ethnography and network science that is, as far as we know, unique. Implementing it required building our own tools: software to implement ethnographic coding directly on the Edgeryders platform and to induce and analyze, from the platform database, what we call semantic social networks. This intellectual journey also led to forging alliances, even friendships, with other researchers, notably the network science group at Bordeaux University, led by the wonderful Guy Melan\u00e7on (@melancon on the platform).\n\nSince the experience had been so positive, **in late 2017 we decided to set up a workgroup dedicated to research in Edgeryders**. The idea was to systematically scout for opportunities to improve our understanding of collective intelligence, our techniques for evoking it and our tools for analyzing its outcomes. Ideally, we would do this by choosing as case studies urgent issues that the Edgeryders community at large care about. \n\nIn so doing, we reasoned, we would hit several birds with one stone. We would, of course, become better at picking the collective brain for information and insight \u2013 and this would make us better at consulting, which has so far been our main revenue stream. We would create opportunities for passionate, skillful members of our community to be paid to have a go at fixing problems they care about (improving citizen science, fighting climate change, making sense of the rise of populism in Europe...). And we would create a stream of revenue for Edgeryders as a company, with long project cycles (2-3 years per project) that allow fairly long-range planning. The rewards were large enough to merit an investment. As research director, I accepted responsibility for it. Then, we recruited Anique Yael Vered (@anique.yael on the platform), and put her in charge of  implementing this strategy, and if possible to improve upon it. \n\n**One year on, the results are in, and they are encouraging**. We decided to focus our effort on a campaign to bring semantic social network analysis to the European Union's Horizon 2020 research program. We positioned ourselves as a hardworking, loyal, ambitious junior partner, with undisputed leadership on a new and exciting research method, SSNA itself. **In the spring of 2018, we presented nine proposals: two of them were successful, a third one passed the first stage of evaluation and is still in the race**. Our success rate is 25%, almost double the average of 13%. The two successful proposals are worth a total of eight million euro; Edgeryders's own budget runs to 1.3 million. Both projects will start in January 2019 and run to the end of 2021. They will leave Edgeryders profoundly changed \u2013 much better equipped to harness collective intelligence in the service of our community, our clients, and humanity at large. Not bad for our first year.\n\nAnd it's not just these projects, either. We have put ourselves on the map of European research; acquired confidence and a better sense of how to build proposals; acquired new partners, some of them strategic. We built up the administrative plumbing to participate in EU-funded research (legal and financial validation). And critically, we re-involved many a \"brilliant misfit\" from the Edgeryders community in meaningful, paid work, which is, ultimately, our mission. \n\nSo, here's what's going to happen. **We are making the workgroup on research permanent, and scaling it up. We are calling it the [Edgeryders Research Network](https://edgeryders.eu/c/research-network)**. As every key piece of Edgeryders, we are making it a public good. Collective intelligence is not just something we use to do research \"out there\": it's how we operate at home. **Openness and treating the Research Network's assets as public goods available to everyone are our chosen path to scaling**. So, if you, too, are riding the edge of change, and if you have research interests but no academic affiliation to pursue them, come talk to us. Chances are, we might be able to help, collaborate or even act as the store front for your project.", "created_at": "2018-10-22 09:40:52.145006", "updated_at": "2019-03-04 08:24:00.755513", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1047, "wiki": false, "reads": 45, "score": 819.0, "like_count": 10, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 3904, 347, 2095, 3323, 2915, 1673, 4448, 3433, 5449], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56420, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 38, "raw": "Great news, thank you so much for giving this idea support - I will make it worthwhile;) \n\nI had a call today with one of the Biennale managers, with whom we briefly discussed opening this even wider, to 6 different projects that will be part of this Biennale - so the platform would be in fact accessible with different entry questions in 6 locations: the University of Ljubljana, the national library, the biggest newspaper, the Modern Art Gallery and maybe a garden, on top of the Museum of Architecture and Retirement home.

That's the main functionality.\n\nAt that point, the user's content contribution is in Discourse, the consent funnel is confirmed, and the user has a Discourse account.

For example, treating each new text file as a new topic, and keeping track of who said what through some simple syntax. Field notes could then be imported into Discourse in batch and new informant users created as needed.[/quote]\n\nThis is also how I'd approach this. (Means, let's not use Open Ethnographer codes for anything but meta-data about the *content* of the coded text. Metadata about the author etc. is the concern of Discourse.)\n\nHere is a quick outline of how I'd create this piece of software:\n\n* **Data format.** Markdown with some wrapper format to encode a dialogue. Ideally we'd use an established format that ethnographers use to note down dialogs before coding them. Or alternatively a format that falls out of transcription software that is able to recognize multiple speakers (if such a thing exists). Or alternatively a cross-platform-compatible format used by online forums to represent dialogues. The format should allow to assign sections both to new and to existing Discourse accounts.\n\n* **Import destination.** The transcriptions of offline dialogues should by default not be publicly visible, because it is out of context and also requires the consent of the original speakers to publish it online. It should however be accessible to ethnographers by placing it into categories accessible by Discourse group `annotator`. It should also be accessible to the artificially created accounts of speakers by means of assigning a newly created Discourse group.\n\n* **Import function.** Importing the dialogs should be a feature of the Open Ethnographer backend, not of external tools or scripts. Because in the interest of software quality, Open Ethnographer should become a coherent whole in the end, not a wild collection of scripts of which nobody has an overview, or knows which versions of the scripts are compatible with one another.\n\n* **Re-import function.** A frequent use case will be that an ethnographer prepares a transcript, imports it to Discourse, then refines the transcript and imports it again. If no annotations have been added to the previously imported content, this should automatically replace the previously imported content.\n\n* **Export function.** For completeness, we might want to add a function that can export Discourse topics in the same format that the import function expects. This makes sense if there is indeed a standard format that ethnographers use to represent dialogs, in which case this export function allows the integration of Open Ethnographer with other QDA tools.\n\nEffort estimation: 2.5\u20134 person months, targeting the same software quality that Open Ethnographer has right now, and then some more (\"well usable, but some rough edges remain\").", "created_at": "2020-08-09 20:33:53.561330", "updated_at": "2020-08-09 20:33:53.561330", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 466, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [79242], "is_reply_to": [79242], "is_liked_by": [4096], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56393, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 34, "raw": "Since @nadia does not want to use this for the POPREBEL or NGI Forward project in the end, we can't use any H2020 project funds for this.

Slack, Riot, Facebook, whatever..Riot, now Element, is a good one because it is ultra-casual - stuff gets erased after a couple of weeks.  The \"status report\" topic in this Campfire is sort of a halfway measure for that.  But it doesn't get used all that much.  And I know that everyone pretty much is one the social media platforms platforms of their choice saying and reading similar things with many if not most of the people they know.  But sometimes one doesn't want their work relationships to merge with their other social life, which I think is a good thing for many people.  So how to fulfill the work version of it?  That is what the \"water cooler\" stuff is all about.  Personally I would over-supply the check-in type of talk using very 'casual' media.  Zoom is too much of a performance sometimes, it seems to me. \n\nThese days none of this is easy at all.  I think everyone is stressed out in ways they - we - have perhaps never been, certainly not so much collectively.

Zovem se Ivan, i prosvetni sam radnik (ovo bi trebalo da sugeri\u0161e da sam klasno osve\u0161\u0107en J). Predajem filozofiju u srednjim \u0161kolama u Be\u010deju. Poslednje 2-3 godine posebno sam zainteresovan za kriti\u010dko mi\u0161ljenje kao koncept primene nau\u010dne metodologije u svakodnevnom \u017eivotu. Na faksu sam izu\u010davao pitanja filozofske skepse, one apsolutno sitni\u010dave skepse (takore\u0107i, da li \u017eivimo u Matriksu?), ali mene sada interesuje pre svega prakti\u010dna sumnja, uop\u0161te adekvatan pristup informacijama, koji treba da negujemo u svakodnevici \u2013 kao potro\u0161a\u010di, kao pacijenti, gra\u0111ani, radnici itd.

These two documents list everything we had agreed to strive to do, and this is also what is going to be reviewed by the EC next year.\n\nHere are excerpts in relation to the work to provide for deliverable 4.5 / social contract for community-driven care design:\n\n_Description of Action - excerpts :_\n\n_1.4.4 Design for participation and collective intelligence: own contribution_ p22/66\n\nAs design tools are democratized, design professionals must take on the role of trigger and support for meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration (Manzini 2015). OpenCare does just that, and hopes to contribute to advancing the field in two ways. \nThe first, consistently with objective 1, is to focus on execution and so provide a detailed case study of designing for collaboration. We instantiate a large-scale collaboration experiment and document our trials, errors and successes.\n**The second, consistent with objectives 1 and 2, is an attempt to take out exploitation out of the participatory design picture. This is done by underwriting an explicit social contract with the OpenCare community, styled as a collective author and researcher. to this end, we run a social lab to reflect on the nature of accountability, governance, and ownership in distributed participatory design in care provision. By role-playing, simulations, and storytelling, we explore the dynamics of  the distributed innovation systems under a spectrum of desirable, and less so, schemes of governance, and value propositions from the community members.**\n\n**The ethnographic account of the narratives of expectations and fears of the participants resulting from this activity, and a systematic study of the technical tools available to empower a fully scalable citizen participation, are documented and published for peer evaluation and reproduction.**\n\n_1.4.6 Own contribution of the project to care policy making_ - p23/66\n**The objective of the project is to build a foundation for development of future community-based collective intelligence projects.**The ambition is to find ways to collect and disseminate new ideas and knowledge in areas where markets, or market incentives, do not exist. This can be done either by the creation of markets (or pseudo-markets) or incentives (such as Xprizes or prediction markets) or by creating other structures and incentive schemes that are not market based. **Part of the research project is to identify workable (and proven) methods to do so, and to find out when different methods are suitable and effective.**\nSince the area is not well developed, a major contribution is the research on, and mapping of, existing projects. Here, the OpenCare network will be used to help find these projects.\nThe tangible output (to be published in academic journals) will be:\n**\u25cf Identified best practice from previous research and existing projects.**\n**\u25cf Mapping of existing collective intelligence projects.**\n**\u25cf Policy design based on this identified best practice.**\n\n\n\n\n_Grant Agreement, Annex 1, excerpts - p18/33:_\n\n_Objectives:_\n\nThe research questions are both empirical, (I) to what extent have collective intelligence projects (including prediction markets) been used in the care sector in Europe, (II) what are the features of these programs, and **policy oriented (III) what will make a collective intelligence project successful (e.g. which policies will facilitate the emergence of successful projects), (IIII) to what extent existing project are scalable. The field studied will be the European health care sector, where bottom up, collaborative projects might provide new solutions, providing real value for society.**\n\n_Description of work on WP4:_\n\nUsing the empirical findings, and theory derived from other sectors, we identify a \u201cbest practice\u201d for community based\ncollective intelligence projects and use this best practice to evaluate existing projects and **provide policy guidelines for future development of such solutions in areas where markets are limited or non-existing. The whole process maintains an ongoing relationship with WP1 by feeding its results onto the main OpenCare conversation.**\n\n\n_Description of tasks and deliverables for WP4 (following page):_\n\n**Task 4.4: Reinvent mass collaboration as a non-exploitative activity (Task leader: SCImPULSE; months 13-23)**\nWe use ethnographic techniques to explore if, and how, the accountability and ownership policies in citizen\ncyberscience carry through to community-driven innovation in the welfare sector. **We document the expectations and fears of participants to participatory design in care, map pitfalls against sustainability and scalability, and identify the means to deploy fair, non-extractive citizen participation. This latches onto the policy-oriented WP4 because mass participation in public service provision is inhibited by the fear of activism serving as the fig leaf for the political expediency of budget cuts (Lowndes & Pratchett 2012).**\n\n\n\n_D4.5 : Community-driven care: a draft [18]_\n**A draft explicit social contract for community-driven care services design, aimed at removing exploitation from the participatory design picture.

They refer to Annex 1, but Annex 1 of what? We are supposed to say whether the Data Management Plan \"needs updating\", but in my understanding that document is an evolving one, and we write at least 3 times in the course of the project. Can we just point to a web page where we keep the updated version of the plan?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>It seems that the core of the report is a sort of progress report on WPs and Tasks in Part B. That would lead to a natural division of labour, because each WP and Task each have one partner responsible for it. So we would have WP teams led by WP leaders; and within them, task leaders would be charged with writing the update on individual tasks. Where needed, task leaders as\u00a0other involved partners for written contributions to incorporate in the text.</li>\n\n<li>Not a question, but a heads up: for everyone publishing data: the time has come to get serious, get DOIs, etc. Edgeryders will make sure that this happens for the data hosted on our website.\u00a0I will post on this issue separately.</li>\n\n<li>Anyone's got \u00a0scientific papers in the pipeline?\u00a0We are a bit short there.

We agreed the following: \n\n* The main funded activity for the Lab in 2020 is going to be a sort of incubator of alt-economies. Ideal participants are people that want to be ecosystem engineers in their local economies; they aspire to rewiring the whole local economy in a long-termist, human-friendly, low-carbon way.  They could be working for a public authority, or community foundations, for example. \n* The incubator's goal is to build capacity and shared vision in about 20 ecosystem engineers for local economies. The alumni then go forth and, together or separately, use capacity and vision to interpret mainstream funding streams for regional policies (example: the European Regional Development Fund, or the Just Transition Fund) to realize the vision. The incubator's path to impact is in the policy, not si much in making new policy streams but in using well the existing ones.  \n* Most of the incubator's work is done online. We use the format of well-prepared webinars. Each webinar features an existing or fictional local alt-economy (ecovillages, community foundations, post-capitalist business hubs like Calafou etc.). Each consists of a 10 minutes pre-recorded video interview (also used to promote the webinar) + a deep Q&A with the protagonists of the experience being featured. Videos to be produced by @estragon with my content supervision (and, in practice, a lot of low-level editing work from me too). \n* This work culminates in a fundraising event to be held in Messina in the fall (subject to the lifting of travel restrictions). FDCM has generously agreed to fund a small number of writers' residencies for econ-SF, which we should announce as soon as possible. I want to explore with @nadia and @hugi the possibility of making the residency more participatory by adding a BBU-type experiment, if we can find someone to pay for it. Let's have a call, guys?\n\nTentative calendar: \n\n* May 25th: application to the DG REGIO citizen engagement call submitted.

What are Edgeryders Forms used for with events?\nEdgeryders Forms provide an easy access to join the platform and a specific conversation both for new and sporadically present community members who still have problems navigating the platform.\n\n*  The idea is that the link to the \"form\" is the only instruction needed to get them onboarded to the event, conversation and platform.\n     * *Therefore an event form needs to include a description of the event that would serve as an introduction to the topic by itself and states that it is an event organised by Edgeryder + x collaborators.*\n* Filling out the form does two things:\n     * creating a new or logging into an existing account\n     * Posting a comment in a thread defined in the form template\n* The goal of the form is **not** to generate a list of participants for the event. Registered event participants are everyone who has commented in the thread the form links to for the output posts. The link for the call will be sent via pm to everyone who has commented in that thread, which automatically includes all the ones who filled in the form as well as those who already were on the platform. \n     * Therefore it is important to make sure to link the participant information sheet from the beginning in the post header that is linked to the outputs of the form *(question here @nadia, should we link that output directly to the event page on the platform (like this one for [Messina](https://edgeryders.eu/t/relational-goods-stocks-over-flows-systems-over-networks-a-webinar-on-the-strange-economy-of-the-messina-district/13534)) or create a new thread? A new thread could generate confusion, linking directly back to the event page would prob best?)*\n# 2. The Output Thread:\nThe form generates comments for a thread of your choosing.\nMake sure this thread includes:\n\n   1. A link to [the participant information shee](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-calls-and-webinars-participant-information-sheet/13445)t from the consent funnel edited to fit the event in question.\n  2. The lines: \n    * \"All who comment on this post will receive the link for the event call.\" \n    * \"Note that by attending that call you will consent to the recording and transcribing of the call for research purposes as described in the participant information sheet.\" \n    * \"Do not share the link to the call directly but rather share this link if you want to invite someone *(put the link to the form)*.\" \n\n\n# 3. How to set up the form: \n\n   1. Go to the [example form / template](https://edgeryders.eu/t/example-edgeryders-form/14202), enter edit mode and copy all of the text.\n   2. Create a \u201cNew Topic\u201d in the [Workspace and Webcontent-Sandbox category](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/webcontent-sandbox/349)\n   3. Paste the copied text.\n   4.  Now you can check the preview at https://tell.edgeryders.eu/ *new topic number* \n   5. Redirect the output of the form:Change the \u201ctopic\u201d number in the configuration (for example \u201ctopic\u201d: 14202) to the number on the end of the URL of the **Output Thread** you created.\n   6. Edit, copy, delete or adjust the texts in the different fields as you need and check the results in the preview. Remember to include an event description that could stand on its own on the top and mention the organisers (edgeryder + collaborators)\n   7. Once you are satisfied with your form, you can edit the WebKit page (like this one [Messina District Webinar - Webkit [XML]](https://edgeryders.eu/t/messina-district-webinar-webkit-xml/14241)) to include the form. > Enter edit mode in the WebKit post of your event and add/edit towards the end of the post.", "created_at": "2020-08-20 10:52:04.489341", "updated_at": "2020-08-24 13:53:27.715009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56599, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 29, "raw": "I'm going to Borderlands and will be able to host a Open Source workshop to initiate this work.\n\nIf you are interested let me know and I'll set it up on spot.", "created_at": "2019-07-13 14:48:26.087923", "updated_at": "2019-07-13 14:48:26.087923", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 70.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4861, 1856, 4, 4897], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57118, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10383, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Ok for my part", "created_at": "2019-07-24 20:20:09.925025", "updated_at": "2019-07-24 20:20:09.925025", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82306, "user_id": 4661, "topic_id": 14264, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hi, @alberto !\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:9, topic:14264\"]\nThis, in turn, is based on the \u201ccitizen expert\u201d ideology. People, as a whole, are thinking adults, and we will do them the honor of taking what they say at face value.\n[/quote]\n\nI so much appreciate this approach!  People have a tendency to live up to our expectations, so it behooves us to set a high bar.  On the other hand, I am mightily discouraged at the level of online discourse I have been witnessing.  Whether I take what someone says at face value depends on a lot of factors.  If they are talking about corona virus, 5G and alien abductions I am very likely *not* to take what they say at face value.  How would you code a post with those terms?  It's subjective.  I assume you are relying on the judgement of the person doing the coding to filter that out.\n\nThe question that pops up for me here is \"scalability.\"  Since I really don't understand what the project is about, it might not even be a concern.  Maybe the domain (the corpus of documents) is limited, and the number of human coders is sufficient, so it is feasible to code all the documents quickly enough to be of practical use.  I'm kind of used to thinking about how a system will scale, and trying to anticipate potential scalability problems in the design phase.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:10, topic:14264\"]\nThe proximity between `healthcare` and `low-quality`... does not emerge from the space between the two snippets in the text.\n[/quote]\n\nI wouldn't expect that it would.  It seems more like a filter to apply *before* you start comparing documents.  If the terms are very far apart within the documents, you might want to not even consider the document.\n\nElasticsearch gives you a normalized \"relevance\" score, which is calculated based on number of occurrences, intra-document proximity of search terms, etc.  In structured text like HTML or XML you can give more weight to text in headings or in **bold** or *italics*.  (At a minimum, this would help human coders, I would think, since it's trivial to highlight any codes in a document to facilitate human review.)  \nThis would also serve as a reduction technique, albeit in a different manner than what you describe above, because you could filter out the less relevant documents and focus on the ones that are most relevant in a very precise way; perhaps prior to further analysis.\nI was left curious about the reduction techniques you are currently using that allow you to reject crazy participants.  Can we apply them to our facebook friend lists? LOL!\n\nThere are other features that I imagine might be useful that are incorporated in Elasticsearch/Lucene, but that are more complicated to implement on one's own, especially if doing it for multiple languages.  Stemming, aliasing of terms (so a phrase like \"physical well-being\" could be made relevant in a search for \"healthcare\"), adding searchable fields of meta-data.\n\nBut it sounds like you're taking a more human-centric approach.  It just seemed like this would be a powerful and flexible approach to the question of rating whether a document is relevant (and how relevant is it?), which was how I interpreted @amelia's  original question about proximity.", "created_at": "2020-08-25 16:08:33.169790", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 17:02:58.179359", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 558, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [82202, 82204], "is_reply_to": [82202, 82204], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36950, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 6683, "post_number": 38, "raw": "Thanks, Noemi.

For those unfamiliar with our tool, Graph Ryder, this means that we are looking the connections between codes that have been mentioned together by community members at least 4 times. \n\nLet's start with an overview of the conversation as a whole at k=4. This is everything that everyone is talking about across the NGI Forum.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.37.33|690x298](upload://6qDbOySZqGRT3Ze3ZsRgfJe3Oa5.png) \n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.37.01|690x428](upload://gI95YlkItWt1KzLrt8k1VOFHiUJ.png) !\n\nWe can see some broad themes emerging as we look at the graph as a whole. Central nodes include codes like `personal data`, connected to codes like `business model` and `advertising`. From this `personal data` node, we get an idea of some of the issues community members are wrestling with. \n\nIf we follow the `personal data` code to `advertising` and `business model` to the left and `trade-off` to the right, we can see some very interesting debates emerging. \n ![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.40.30|690x419](upload://ku369nJgwHVoWVMm4XUc47Ah5Qm.png) \n\nIt's clear even at this level that the use of `personal data` sets up a `trade-off` for a lot of participants. In `decision-making` about sharing or protecting `personal data`, community members are `considering larger context` around its use and `assessing the impact` of the trade-off. `cost` is also a key consideration. `Personal data` also connects strongly, if we move south, to `agency`, in a highly illustrative cluster with `control` and `user experience`. We see, again, trade-offs set up -- between `user control` and `user experience`, raising questions about what one gets when one gives up `personal data`, and how much control is possible. Community members also raise questions about the effort and `cost` of controlling personal data in the current environment, when responsibility is highly individualised (`individualising responsibility` is a salient code at a lower level of co-occurrences). \n\n![image|480x411](upload://pf6CT0S8qxiUJcHl5HqYFlOBWw7.png) \n\nMoving these abstract concepts into concrete examples, we can look at the left of `personal data` to see these applied to the specific case of advertising and `journalism`. Selling `personal data` for `advertising` creates revenue for `journalism`, without which there is an issue of `information quality`. But there are other potential `business model`s to be considered outside of the selling of `personal data`, like `subscription` models. We can also see that community members understand that `\"free\"` access to services is not always actually free, since the `catch` is the selling of their `personal data`. Yet `journalism`, without a sustainable `business model`, is facing some serious `funding issues`. The fundamental problem is about `assigning value` to things like journalism, which opens to the question of how to fund it without shady `advertising` practices. These are all strongly connected to the question of `ethics`, a key concern in `journalism` writ large which is closely tied to ethical considerations around advertising, monetisation, personal data, and how to construct a sustainable business model. \n\nFollowing the graph north, we can see `business model` and `advertising` also connected to `monetisation` and `big tech`. A series of issues around `big tech` have been outlined by the community -- the need for `regulation`, the way it perpetuates `inequality` (`facebook` is a key example of `big tech`). \n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.49.23|690x505](upload://xbiKTiFLfdXNRrN8rf39ARDl5zD.png) \n\nAlternatives to `big tech` emerge around `open source`, which has an interesting network built around it -- questions of `'empowerment'` (does open source empower users?), the need for `training` to use open source tools, and the question of whether using open source tools opens one up to increased `risk`. As a `technological solution`, open source also allows community members to `imagine alternatives` to the status quo. It also connects to `'human-centred design'`, as community members ask what exactly it would look like to design digital tools with and for humans.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.50.39|690x576](upload://vsdMtX4r76aob6pi9OCopfmyfRp.png) \n\n`open source` also strongly connects with `privacy`, an extremely central node in the conversation. `privacy` connects back to `personal data`, and we see an illustrative network of privacy concerns articulated by the community: around `smart cities` and `human rights`, `covid-19` and `contact tracing`, and as aforementioned, `trade-off` and `decision-making`. A salient theme is the question of how to weigh up privacy trade-offs, in order to make optimal decisions about one's own data privacy. What does it `cost`? There is `uncertainty` around how extensive `surveillance` is, and a `distrust` of the information that one is given about these technologies, which makes making quality decisions about these issues difficult for community members.\n\n![image|505x515](upload://oV5qfJaw7McKsGCl6SfgVJV9oCm.png) \n\nAlso connected to 'trade off' and `assessing impact` is a series of environmental concerns. Moving to the bottom-right of the graph, questions of `resource consumption` and `energy` are tied to `environmental sustainability` and `cost`, showing us a snapshot of the rich conversation emerging on platform around technology, the internet, and environmental sustainability. \n\n![image|601x247](upload://tt6qFpMC7YA6pIpwaLQUXHkCiHv.png) \n\nReturning to the topic of trust in technology, we see an interesting web of concepts emerging around `artificial intelligence`.  AI is connected to `inequality` and `big tech`. It's also connected to issues of `transparency` and `oversight`, as well as `effectiveness`. This cluster of codes tells us that there is an ongoing conversation around what kinds of oversight of AI might a) be actually effective, rather than performative and b) lead to increased transparency of AI and `algorithms`. We also see these connected to more concrete questions on what it takes to make these technological infrastructures: their `production cycle` and the `raw materials` needed.\n\n@katejsim gives a great analysis of `co-working` in the post above. I'd like to draw attention to the connections between the internet and online life and the concrete effects those have on life offline. We can see that `covid-19` has lead to an increase of `working remotely`, perhaps unsurprisingly. But it has also lead to a shift of living conditions, particularly `co-living` and `co-working`, totally reshaping the division of `public space` and `private space`, leading community members to `build alternatives` and `organising space` differently. \n\nPart of the impact of `covid-19` has been a `shift to online` and a corresponding` sense of loss`, of `public space`, of `social engagement`, with `mental health` impacts. One way of addressing this has been to seek a `sense of community` by reworking offline spaces to increase `social interaction`. For `students` and `universities`, this is especially pressing. \n\n ![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 11.00.11|690x558](upload://v6iYh3D5yl8mPXDEOkPflWfydqK.png)\n\nA code I want to keep tracking is of `defining terminology`, as NGI community members try to cut to the heart of some of the bigger, buzzier issues in tech and the internet. ![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 11.06.13|375x257](upload://v12WT7NXFd0vvUK4UpxOYGzsL1f.png) \n\nThe code is meaningfully connected to `nuancing the debate`, telling us something about how to move forward and tackle the thornier, more challenging issues in this area in meaningful ways.

With increasingly limited resources available for traditional research and development, there is an imperative for research institutions, corporations and individuals to collaborate in generating and executing innovative ideas. Our vision is for Unexus.org to provide a platform where the innovators of today build innovation communities to develop, implement and showcase solutions to some of the world\u2019s greatest challenges.\n\nWe therefore built a global web-based platform for today\u2019s innovators to create profiles and projects to attract ideas, expertise and funding. Each project has a main project page, and may include additional pages containing information relevant to the project. Innovation communities are created around projects from the flow of knowledge around the platform.\n\nWe set up Unexus.org in late 2010 motivated by our own desire to create collaborative communities around various knowledge and ideas. For example, I am currently undertaking an Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in international political economy with an interdisciplinary research agenda spanning historical sociology, international politics and cognitive science. I was also writing articles in psychoanalytic philosophy and wanted to create a community of people sharing similar knowledge bases. It was difficult for me to find these people, but now with Unexus.org I just need to create profile pages for what I'm working on and then build the community in a few simple steps.\n\nThe website has gained traction and received the support of the Global Entrepreneur Programme of the United Kingdom Trade and Investment Department. We are also collaborating with the Erasmus Mundus Association and the OCEANS Network to help their innovators and entrepreneurs get exposure for their projects and build their own innovation communities.\n\nWe have a wonderfully talented and creative team and are looking to build our own innovation community of people who share our vision for building innovation communities to develop, implement and showcase solutions to some of the world's greatest challenges. In many ways we share a similar ethos to Edgeryders in that we want to showcase the wonderful and inspirational examples of innovators and entrepreneurs in society who providing solutions to problems.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-25 13:03:08", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 17:05:31.405494", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77124, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 13534, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hi, Nadia!\n\n\"Soon\", of course, is dreadfully simple... and vague -- it is \"before the money runs out\".\n\nThe interesting aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic in this context is that it is NOT what Nassim Nicholas Taleb termed a \"Black Swan\" event -- something that is not predictable -- it IS predictable and WAS predicted -- it is just a relatively unlikely event in any given year. Climate change is different, because not only is it predictable, we have scientists predicting various consequences within a range. So for many companies ensuring they are capable of withstanding a rare event such as a pandemic might be too much burden to carry, unless you are referring to a plan of how to pick up pieces after everything falls apart; on the other hand, not designing so as to withstand the consequences of climate change would be extremely foolhardy. There is no \"resistance to shock\" as such, other than willingness to respond flexibly to threats; there is only resistance to specific statistically reasonably possible shocks.\n\nYes, absolutely -- externalities make a huge difference -- not necessarily only the negative externalities similar to those mentioned above -- one kind of which requires a response and the other of which may only demand willingness and ability to be flexible -- but of course responding to government responses to those externalities is critical. So if your production process is polluting it may only matter to you as a company shareholder if someone forces the company to pay to minimize or clean up the pollution.\n\nWith respect to health care: I suppose you are referring to the famous \"Baumol's Paradox\" that is supposedly applicable to many services in which the technology hasn't changed in centuries, even though the wages of workers grow in line with other jobs. I am skeptical: even for musicians, the classic case, recording and broadcasting technology has hugely increased their productivity. Medicine of course has been utterly transformed by technology. But you may be making a category error -- you definitely DO get lower costs for any given technology in health care -- the patents expire and other companies make a generic product for much less, etc etc. What drives up costs is the DEMAND side (for sure assisted by supply) -- as our societies become richer we are willing and able to spend more and more on NEW technologies which help more of us to live longer, so we spend more on health as a proportion of our income, because we have basics like eating and shelter taken care of.

Out of seven 1:1 meetings one resulted in actually joining this consortium, another one might lead to that (still need to do some follow up meetings). \n\nHere we use our standard workpackage and contribute to the project currently entitled \"**BEE Proactive: Enhancing SMART beehive monitoring systems to reduce pesticide use\"**. Initial concept note [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/14Y38nvUj9gNmmG6i3tMmoeuLDKK4zewm). The consortium is still being finalized and the WPs will be further shaped based on that. It is led by the Sabanci University (Turkey), although the official leader might be different. I communicated with [Christopher Mayack](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/cmayack/) from the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences. \n\nToday we had a meeting with several other partners and our approach fits well. One of the requirements of the call is to engage not only the practitioners but also public and private institutions and citizens with special focus on young generation of farmers, entrepreneurs and researchers. \n\nThis would be a large online conversation on sustainability and resilience of food systems but focusing on the beekeeping community. It might be a bit challenging for us, but I think overall it's super interesting and there is a great potential in exploring this topic also within the existing community on our platform. Other partners will be experts in the field with good networks so I'm sure they could contribute with onboarding the targeted communities. They also plan to use online communication to connect better bee health experts and beekeepers, but also to test their solutions. Our platform could support this as well. Note: they asked for multilingual options (it will most likely be Turkish, German, English and maybe another language). \n\n**Next steps:** \n\n- in the upcoming days they will define the PI and the consortium leader\n- dedicated google drive will be shared\n- we will be asked to contribute. From our side, we start with sharing with them our adapted standard workpackage. For this, I will need @alberto for a paragraph to make it more adapted to the topic, and @nadia for the outreach and engagement part. Note: we might also be asked to integrate our methodology in the existing WP (not lead our own). We can decide on the KPIs and keep them lower, depending on the budget. We'll discuss this when the time comes.\n- anyone else from the team is welcome to comment, contribute and share ideas, especially when it comes to signing off to what we finally promise.\n\nping: @noemi @amelia @johncoate @matthias @hugi @MariaEuler @IvanC @bojanbobic ...          \n\n:honeybee:", "created_at": "2020-11-10 16:36:08.269118", "updated_at": "2020-11-10 16:36:16.747636", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 499, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 82.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 4, 8, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77170, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13612, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Menu: [Start](https://edgeryders.eu/t/start-page/13522), [About us](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-us/13524), [Services](https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-services/13475), [Methods](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-science-collective-intelligence-technology/13472),  [Themes](https://edgeryders.eu/t/thematic-clusters/13484), [People](https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-people/13474/2), [Projects](https://edgeryders.eu/t/projects/13526), [Impact Strategy](https://edgeryders.eu/t/impact-strategy/13612), [Blog](https://edgeryders.eu/tags/blog?view=topic-preview) \n<hr>\n\n\n\n# Build Dense Networks + Harvest Collective Intelligence\n\nOur theory of change is to build dense networks around people trying to tackle messy social ecological, economic and political challenges. To do this work we use a set of advanced technologies and methods for inducing and harnessing collective intelligence dynamics in online conversations.\n\nHaving a dense network around you is one of the hallmarks of social capital, and gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing. In a dense network, there are many ways for you to get from one point to another. There are three challenges for building and making full use of such a network.\n\n* Ability of people with aligned interests to find and connect with one another amongst the crowd. \n* Accessing the knowledge and experience of others to get tangible benefits that incentivise continued engagement in the network (save time, money and energy or be enabled to do something that would otherwise not have been possible). \n* Establishing a culture of open entrepreneurial collaboration to generate income and tangible impact on the ground. \n\nFrom the perspective of a client or funder, the main challenge is how to unlock the capacity of individuals, groups and organisations to solve the issues that matter to them.\n\nEdgeryders was designed to meet these needs. Our solutions do not start from scratch - they build on 7 years of work we have done on building the enabling science, methods and technologies.\n\n## Our tactics and technologies\n\nDense networks are not designed: they evolve.\n\n* **Start with \"viable mutants\".** We identify suitable initiatives that have achieved tangible initial progress. Many are already known to us through our extended networks.\n* **Provide conditions for expansion.** We support efforts efforts to secure resources for a scaled-up deployment of each initiative.\n* **Speed up the rates of adaptation.** We push initiatives out in the field early, encouraging prototyping and rapid learning. Knowledge sharing practices borrowed from open source hackers enable initiatives to imitate each other's tactics, further speeding up adaptation.\n* **Promote niche discovery and colonization.** Knowledge sharing institutions are a natural venue for initiatives to trade with each other. This promotes specialization into emerging niches in the ecosystem and enriches it.\n* **Enforce natural selection.** Initiatives that fail to complete any step of the process are dropped. Initiatives are encouraged and supported to become self-supporting by the end of the process.\n* **The technology that supports this evolution is the [Edgeryders stack](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-science-collective-intelligence-technology/13472)**: an online platform technology, community management and open source digital tools to enable meaningful, purpose oriented dialogue and distributed collaboration over the internet amongst groups of varying size,  within as well as across organisational and geographic boundaries.\n* **Finally we document and disseminate the results widely**, seeking to challenge the prevailing narrative of how successful business ventures and ecosystems are born and sustained.\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n### Learn more\n\n* *[Video](https://start.edgeryders.eu/#mission)*\n* *[Minisite](http://hugi.se/openvillage)*\n* *Slides from public presentation: [Edgeryders Sensestack Tech Primer (1).pdf|attachment](upload://mccBFnwdf5zh8GujYy5k2kw5mPn.pdf) (3.5 MB)*\n* *Slides from public presentation: [Harvesting collective intelligence.pptx (1).pdf|attachment](upload://hXRoUSrgm8h480BH4AYvlJ7aRgN.pdf) (4.0 MB)* \n<br>\n<hr>\n\nEnquiries: [company@edgeryders.eu](mailto:company@edgeryders.eu)", "created_at": "2020-05-21 17:01:17.582106", "updated_at": "2020-05-23 08:45:19.982115", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 611, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74847, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 13222, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Again, from here I would use the Graphryder video and Open ethnography video.

I was an administrator of the FluTrackers community (based in Florida, United States). I built the Francophone section of this international forum.\n\nWhat the citizens have imagined is awesome! They thought about alternative ways to survive, they absolutely do not rely on their governments to 'save' their lives. From making masks with T-shirts, to filtering mud with coffee filters in order to be able to drink the water from their pool, to keeping warm by sleeping in a tent in their home in case of electricity shortages, to stocking on food, you name it! Citizens have a lot of imagination, they rely on solidarity, and they are much more efficient, when it comes to resilience, than what governments do. Hypothesis proven.\n\nAnd besides not planning and not taking early warnings seriously, governments seem to be much more concerned about hiding the reality, hiding vital information, in case people might panic, than saving actual lives. Which has always made me uncomfortable... These 4 years spent as a Flubie have transformed me into a strong opengov activist. I want transparency tools badly. Not because I want to know where the bicycles are located in my city. No, I don't give a damn about silly such details. I want transparency tools to be up and running, because one of these days, I know that they can help me protect my son's life, and other loved ones. I know that I can probably do a better job than my government, when it comes to resilience, if the government give access to the right information.\n\nWhen communities are included in preps for any type of major catastrophe, it gives better resilience results. As a matter of fact, I consider resilience as the upmost, the highest type of opengov collaboration, between a government and citizens.\n\nLet me know if I can do something to give a hand...\n\nLyne\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-21 15:56:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.829892", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 362, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 116.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72277, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12945, "post_number": 7, "raw": "where/ how are you doing this?

So the person wanting a task to get done looks through through the Makerfox market and orders what is required to get it done. (<em>The details</em>: We had a \"task\" feature once in Makerfox, but removed it because Makerfox is meant to work for collaboration between users who <em>don't know or trust</em> each other yet \u2013 so you wouldn't want to allow anyone to take your task, making people very busy with applying for tasks and accepting / rejecting these applications as the Makerfox needs 10-20 alternatives for each task to find one match. That just wasn't practical \u2026)\n\nSince every market has a chicken and egg problem, your best bet is currently to use a few parallel moneyless crowdfunding campaigns instead. Say, one for organizing the 31C3 session, one for the Edgeryders/Makerfox integration development. Then people support a cause of their choice, and offer something in return. Inter-project collaboration then happens by one person donating to the 31C3 session campaign, and working for ER/Makerfox integration instead, and vice versa for another campaign. That's why having multiple campaigns in parallel is important.\n\nAs you said, planning and setting up a moneyless crowdfunding campaign is some work on its own, so yes, probably keep that as the first collaborative task and send the newsletter before entering something into Makerfox. (Or maybe, already set up the project accounts on Makerfox for the intended moneyless crowdfunding campaigns, as a reference point.)\n\nThat said, there is no company user \"Edgeryders\" on Makerfox so far.

From administration, packaging, HR, sales, logistics, harvesting to sowing. He uses the structure of a large company, but compressed in a craft profession.

However, compared to the dominant mode of policy advice which draws on only a handful of invited and highly orchestrated instances of participation, this mapping represents a much more comprehensive set of evidence upon which to base policy decisions and allows the anticipation of coming barriers or controversies. Far from making policy-makers\u2019 lives harder this approach has the potential in some cases to save time and resources by synthesizing lessons from participation which has already taken place\"\n\n \"Another key challenge in enacting this method is the limitation of the timeliness of results \u2013 at the time of writing the results of our mapping could already be viewed as out of date. However, we would argue that many of the broader patternings and dynamics revealed in our mapping are more enduringly relevant. Furthermore, **we believe that it would be possible to conduct a version of this mapping in a less time and resource intensive manner, making more use of the resources available from digital methods approaches, and on a rolling basis so that the results could be continually updated.

Currently societies across the world make huge investments and efforts to innovate and adjust to a new challenge, however this makes it more important than ever to ask this question: \"Why is all this innovation not being channelled into ways for people to help them live a better life?\". Therefore we have recently returned to this conversation started by a member of the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) about a year ago. What do you think about this, especially in the light of current efforts of fast innovation? https://edgeryders.eu/t/why-is-all-this-innovation-not-being-channeled-into-ways-for-people-to-help-them-live-a-better-life/11443/4  #ngi4eu\n\n2. \"Now that Visa and Mastercard are dropping Pornhub - why not make it illegal to post photos of minors online?\" After seeing recent major policy shifts regarding porn websites, should we maybe even go further?

It is a good time to take a step back and see the whole picture, therefore we ask again: \"How do we organize society for a whole-systems approach for developing the Internet?\"(https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766) #ngi4eu\n4. Swedens approach for dealing with the corona crisis is different and controversial, but there is another aspect of creating to corona in the Scandinavian country that is easily overlooked in that conversation and that is extremely interesting: Sweden high level of digitalisation and ability to quickly shift many services even further into the digital during the pandemic. Digitalisation and the challenges of the Corona crisis are connected topics.

One of the things we are going to do in the next week or so is to work to develop the main ideas we hope this title expresses.  So I will attempt to do so here, but more in-depth work will come out.  I think the points that are raised are very valid and I think fundamental to our collective development of what it would mean to live and work together as the original title described.  \n\nBy communism, we are not referring to the ideals of communists, most of whom were essentially socialists vying for state power to then institute some utopian form of communism.  So that communism was only possible after some transition period, and the accumulation of power.  Both of which are false assumptions, proven over and over again by history.  Be it Ethiopia, USSR, Cuba, or China, these leaders took power by whatever means, in an attempt to take over \"means of production\".  But the problem is not who owns the means, it is the means themselves.  What we mean by \"communism\" is the ancient form of communism.  The form of communism that arises in close knit neighborhoods, the form that Occupy, the Squares movement, and historically, the Spanish anarchists all exemplified.  It is the development of common needs and the sharing of resources and property to meet those ends.  I would argue that communism is our natural form of life if we consider the indigenous ways of life as well as the natural trend towards communism that occurs after natural disasters.  And so when we say \"living communism\" it is a nod to this way of life, having nothing to do with state power and the crimes committed in its name.  \n\nAs for the strategic use of rhetoric, I absolutely agree that there is a strategy around that selection.   When we argue for \"spreading anarchy\", it is not necessarily the \"Black Bloc\" that we are supporting.  Nor is it the adolescent who wants to do \"whatever they want\" mentality of some so called anarchists.  Rather what we are arguing is that anarchy as a form of organizing is fundamental to how we live.  OpenCare is working to highlight decentralized groups that self-organized, most without any state support and that will aim to provide their services or goods for minimal costs, separated from the capitalist model.  I would argue that this is in form \"anarchist\" in that there is autonomy within groups to create their own rules, there is a lack of hierarchical structure, and the goods produced are for the commons.    \n\nInterestingly, the terms \"communism\" and \"anarchy\" have both been painted so negatively by liberalism, which I think is even more potent at this juncture.  Here in the US, there is a feeling of complete polarization.  It is becoming impossible to be \"middle of the road\".  And from what we see in the UK elections, it seems that people are tired of liberalism's vague \"hopes\" for freedom and equality.  That people can say extreme ideas and those ideas can begin to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately this works for both sides, as we see fascist language becoming more commonplace.  But inevitably, I see this as a result of capitalism, not as a reaction to the left.  In fact, because the left here in the US is so weak (mainly because they have been trying to \"compromise\" with capital), they have no power to struggle against the far right.  I would argue that this is a time to recapture our language and our ideas.  We are not fighting for the autonomy of Silicon Valley or the global development ideas of the World Bank.  We are fighting for a new vision of the world, and I don't see how that vision of the world is compatible with capitalism.  If we believe that, then we must openly admit that we are calling for a revolutionary way of living.  And to push our vision forward, we must re-appropriate the words.  So maybe using strong language will push some people away.  But as has been shown in struggles around the world, it has the power to attract even more.  Its a gamble, but so is wanting a different way of life.", "created_at": "2017-07-11 22:09:52.530213", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:02.431781", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 716, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 2.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14634], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77985, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13537, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Here are some of the questions we would like to discuss with you tomorrow:\n\n1. **One of the things that stood out to @johncoate when looking at your data was that anxiety is up while reported depression seems to have gone down during the crisis.**\n**How could we interpret that?

Deadline: 26 January 2021. \n\n## Proposal Structure \nFrom what I can tell from the call, the ideal would be to have:\n\n**a series of comparative ethnographic studies** not unlike the \u201cdeep stories\u201d in PARTENAIRE.  EDGE working with universities like UniAalborg and communities like Blivande. Initial fieldsite ideas: Sweden, Italy for sure, and Denmark if Aalborg is participating. Then potentially: Poland or Hungary, Belgium or Netherlands, Greece or France. My goal would be to create double comparatives: 2 field sites per country and then cross-country comparisons.\n+\n**SSNA/network science** (EDGE and UniBordeaux)\n+\n**government partnerships** (Milano? any government entities we have worked for before? Partners from PARTENAIRE?)\n+\n**Large participatory online conversation** on topics like the future of work (EDGE ala Nadia) with \u201ctransdisciplinary networks of experts, researchers, practitioners and relevant civil society organisations on behavioural, social and cultural change\u201d\n+\nsome **experimental element**, perhaps a partner doing experimental psychology, to study the behavioural change element. Reading more about CKIC, seems like the experiments in long-termism could definitely fit the bill here. \n\nThis last bit is the most up in the air for me, but an experimental element seems to be something they are interested in, could strengthen the proposal, and could be interesting in general.\n## Distribution of Labour\nI can frame the series of ethnographic studies and find academic partners (with @anders, if he\u2019s interested). And talk about the community connects with @hugi.\n\nI can also work with @alberto and @melancon to write the SSNA parts of the proposal, as this is pretty standard for us and we have a good model from PARTENAIRE.\n\nI can work with @nadia and @MariaEuler  to frame the large online conversation proposals.\n\nI will need help with the government partnerships, primarily.\n\nAnd as for experimental psychology, it\u2019s new terrain for all of us so I can do some exploring! @alberto might have fun dreaming that one up with me. Maybe actually we could do SciFi Economics style experimentation\u2026\n\n## Priority questions for Monday\u2019s call \n(@alberto @martin @IvanC):\n\n1. How to think about interfacing with existing partners from projects like PARTENAIRE \u2013 what they do, who might be good to get involved with on this one.\n2. How to incorporate government partnerships.\n3.

In your first post you probably refer to the old city renovation programme, for which we fully share the environmental and social limitations and criticalities you raised. Our intervention was born precisely to falsify that approach, to conceive the urban renovation of the city within integrated policies of sustainable human development and imagining it as a process of hybridization, necessary to overcome the centenary ghettoization and the control mechanisms of the organized crime, that have characterized the distorted community dynamics of those pieces of territory.\n\nOur project is part of the Capacity programme, co-financed by the Council of Ministers as part of the National Programme for the renovation of the suburbs, and focuses only on 2 well-defined areas of the slums (as I said, Fondo Sacc\u00e0 and Fondo Fucile, involving 200 of the more than 2000 families living in the slums). I reiterate the fact that the intervention actions have provided for a broad engagement of residents from the beginning, offering them various options for choosing the housing solution. You will find all the details on the alternatives generated, with also extracts of the interviews carried out with the beneficiaries (which show the long process of mutual trust building), in the intermediate evaluation report I linked above. Further updates and insights will be published shortly, reporting in detail the results of the activities: an evaluative research that models through the game theory the new alternatives generated, and therefore the expansion of the substantial freedoms, for the project beneficiaries is also being published in an international journal with peer review. All these researches are conducted in collaboration with third-party evaluative research centers, independent from the Foundation.\n\nTo further emphasize the distance from the old city renovation program, I also reiterate that, unlike what you report in your post, there is no intention of building speculation: in a confined space, two single-floor eco-buildings, dedicated to hosting about 12 marginalized families and socio-educational services for the community, will be created, while the vast majority of the land will be transformed into an urban park. Finally, our areas of intervention do not concern the seafront, that you mentioned in your post.\n\nThe Foundation has been involved for over 10 years in sustainable social, environmental and economic development projects in the area, with the aim of concretely demonstrating that other development models are possible. The approaches you mention are in no way, and never will be, compatible with the ideals and history of the Foundation. \nSince you are geographically close to us, we will be happy to meet you whenever you want to present our activities in detail!\nYou can directly contact me at g.pinaffo@fdcmessina.org\nBest,\nGiacomo", "created_at": "2020-10-08 16:56:40.192839", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 16:56:40.192839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 471, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 31.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84630], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80398, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14052, "post_number": 9, "raw": "One of the other interviewees for this series, Gary O'Meara in Ireland, says that 33% of the business using Irish co-working spaces have failed, which prompts his call for government assistance to keep the spaces open.

For sure, it is too abstract and oversimplified. With Goodwin's words: \"[it] is a starkly schematized and hence quite unrealistic model of cycles in growth rates\".\n\nHowever, models are not always realistic or predictive. They can be used to explain a particular mechanism or make a point. I do not remember who said that: a mathematical proof is not true, but only a more convincing argument.\n\nRegarding sci-fi, I doubt that the model has been used for a novel. Probably, it has been ignored by non fictional Economics as well. However, and this is the reason why I proposed this model, if you set zero growth in the model, you obtain something very similar to many dystopic novels.\n\nAssume that we reach a tipping point in the current ecological crisis and that governments have to impose zero growth as a policy, otherwise something worse could happen (human extinction). From the model, we can deduce:\n\n* In order to keep zero growth, governments have to control work force growth (birth control, immigration) and suppress dissent caused by high unemployment rates. Beta=0, v in steady state\n* Technology that could improve productivity should be limited. Alpha=0\n* Capitalists are not happy with zero growth. Apparently, the model shows smaller return on investments close to zero growth. Thus they will try to find profits elsewhere. The model says how: worsening working conditions (u), producing bad products and services (s and sigma), commodification of non market sectors (enlarging what we consider in u). Probably, finance would play an important role in this scenario (I suspect that capitals will be moved to finance), but it is not considered in the model.\n\nAs pointed out by Alberto, I am assuming that growth is always bad. Can we have a good kind of growth in a capitalistic economy? Or, can we model explicitly commodification? Commodification is not included in the model, but it could be something interesting to ask and it should be related to needs/preferences/leisure.", "created_at": "2019-11-18 05:03:28.181786", "updated_at": "2019-11-18 05:04:15.634412", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 353, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 43.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64432], "is_liked_by": [4640, 5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60252, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 10915, "post_number": 4, "raw": "to you, too!\nsorry this fall is no good for me to join in for the festival, again, but maybe I will get to help in some concrete way soon?  :blush:", "created_at": "2019-10-01 09:28:59.911284", "updated_at": "2019-10-01 09:28:59.911284", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 26.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59017, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10726, "post_number": 1, "raw": " [ **Deep adaptation** : a map for navigating climate tragedy](http://insight.cumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/4166/) is an academic paper authored in 2018 by a British sustainability professor called Jem Bendell. The paper calls out the sustainability profession for refusing to look climate data in the eye and admitting the possibility \u2013 and maybe the high probability \u2013 of near-term societal collapse due to climate change. Next, it proceeds to propose an agenda that makes sense if you believe that collapse might come. The paper was rejected for publication, apparently on the grounds not that it contained bad science, but that it was too negative. \n\nI finally got around to reading it. It makes an impressive read, more or less what we would get if another brother of @matthias's had become a climate scientist. :smile:\n \nIf there is one single document to guide and inspire EarthOS, I suggest this is it. I am taking the (grim) climate science on trust, but the social analysis sounds familiar (emphasis mine). \n\n> The West\u2019s response to environmental issues has been restricted by the dominance of neoliberal economics since the 1970s. That led to hyper- individualist, market fundamentalist, incremental and atomistic approaches. By **hyper-individualist**, I mean a focus on individual action as consumers, switching light bulbs or buying sustainable furniture, rather than promoting political action as engaged citizens. By **market fundamentalist**, I mean a focus on market mechanisms like the complex, costly and largely useless carbon cap and trade systems, rather than exploring what more government intervention could achieve. By **incremental**, I mean a focus on celebrating small steps forward such as a company publishing a sustainability report, rather than strategies designed for a speed and scale of change suggested by the science. By **atomistic**, I mean a focus on seeing climate action as a separate issue from the governance of markets, finance and banking, rather than exploring what kind of economic system could permit or enable sustainability.\n\nAnd the triad of directions for action: resilience, relinquishment, restoration.\n\n> Deep adaptation will involve more than \u201cresilience.\u201d It brings us to a second area of this agenda, which I have named \u201crelinquishment.\u201d It involves people and communities letting go of certain assets, behaviours and beliefs where retaining them could make matters worse. Examples include withdrawing from coastlines, shutting down vulnerable industrial facilities, or giving up expectations for certain types of consumption. The third area can be called \u201crestoration.\u201d It involves people and communities rediscovering attitudes and approaches to life and organisation that our hydrocarbon-fuelled civilisation eroded. Examples include re-wilding landscapes, so they provide more ecological benefits and require less management, changing diets back to match the seasons, rediscovering non-electronically powered forms of play, and increased community-level productivity and support.\n\n@ilaria and @matthias, I propose an experiment. Would you guys be up for organizing an EarthOS community call on the implications of the deep adaptation paradigm for the Edgeryders community, and EarthOS itself in particular? Should we make it our mission statement? Or just keep it as one thing to pay attention to? I see it as very relevant, especially for The Reef.\n\nIt could be a way to start reaching out to the deep green part of the community, and exploring opportunities for collaborating on meaningful work.

Sharp as ever, @trythis. I am an admirer of Hausmann and Hidalgo's notion of [product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Product_Space), a formalization of the technological interconnectedness between different products and services. Taking it on board leads to an indicator called complexity index, used to measure the health of an economy. The idea behind the complexity index is exactly what you say: a healthy economy is one which can produce many different goods and services, or, in your words, has an extended set of capabilities. \n\nThe complexity index has its own failings (for example, it is sensitive to scale). But I think it carries relevant information if computed as a time series for the same economy.\n\nI suggest this idea could move forward faster if we organized a Lab Seminar about it.

However, fact-checking tools still require human supervision and they seem to carry the risk of biases, mistakes and the possibility of human misuse. In order to overcome misinformation, both journalists and teachers have a responsibility to educate the public on how to spot false narratives and stop them from spreading.\n\n![|624x388](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ijfB4IsX3iO2qdd4Rlq2pzAvmSSICkCU48WWvsyRgalVmjYL288iyE3-4lNkfocCpbt0E85-cB1hQoW21ROddKOJqzlXlyxHzwYmWBpdvEaDUci5Ih3GtvVAN-ROyeRjYQxUtiyH)\n\nSource: https://thebestschools.org/magazine/robot-love-understanding-complicated-relationship-technology/\n\nAre we alone in the fight against misinformation and fake news? Are there tools out there that can help journalists or should we be rather scared of artificial intelligence in the media? Although it seems robots will not conquer our newsrooms in the near future and we will not have an algorithmic army fighting online trolls, it does not mean AI tools are risk-free options. We checked the pros and cons of automated fact checkers. Do they work? Even if they do, can be entirely sure that journalism has the largest responsibility in the war on misinformation?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) - flies airplanes, drives cars, writes news and forecasts the weather. Decides on life and death. Most inventions throughout history provoked controversy - but not many of them had been as widely debated as artificial intelligence. There is still no clear definition of what AI is and what does it do, but its existence opens up many questions. Legal, technical and above all moral and ethical. What are its limits? Achievements? And - perhaps most importantly - who, and how, controls it?\n\nManipulations that AI allow have potentially devastating effects on society: fake news, fake reviews, fake videos evoking fake emotions. At the same time, it is a tool to create better societies, a brighter future, and meaningful jobs. And in the context of journalism, AI can be an ally of both the reader and the author - we invite you to learn about the available tools and their applications.\n\nAI against misinformation\n\nJournalists do not have to fight the battle against fake news alone. There are AI-based tools which can be used in the newsrooms against misinformation. According to Mattia Peretti, the Project Manager at &ldquo;Journalism AI&rdquo; at LSA, the most frequently used are fact-checkers.\n\nFact checking tools use rich databases of verified, high-quality and wide-ranging information. The algorithm is also fed with examples of debunked stories and results of the work of human fact-checkers. According to Lucas Graves from [Reuters Institute Oxford](https://agency.reuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/news-agency/report/reuters-institute-graves-factsheet-180228.pdf) the development focuses on three aims: spotting false or questionable claims circulating in the media; verifying or facilitating verification of claims or stories and delivering corrections instantaneously, across different media, to audiences exposed to misinformation.\n\n![|572x333](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Wiv5g-UfiymWCtQwdjX5ql6Ti3S9eqnqYIyO9nPw1vkg9ip8UOZ02O1CQDEh6GExJprVO7NMMRfAdMEYpfNwFjZZlgtsTWemwlH5XJohiHfsPawk0VemmnDF325vTg2NaLS8ODhT)\n\nLucas Graves: Understanding the Promise and Limits of Automated Fact-Checking. Reuters Institute Oxford. Factsheet 2018.\n\nAt the moment, these fact checkers are half-automated. The databases used in these algorithms have displayed multiple examples of stereotypes and biases, and they are not capable of the judgment and sensitivity to the context, necessary to reliably establish the veracity of the material. &quot; I'm a bit skeptical about AI and fact-checking. Sometimes misinformation is not fake, it's a tone, something very subtle&rdquo; admitted Guido Romeo, Data journalist at FACTA, &ldquo; I have never seen a machine to grasp it&quot;\n\nSimilar results came out of Brooke Borel&rsquo;s (the author of The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking) [research](https://www.popsci.com/can-artificial-intelligence-solve-internets-fake-news-problem), during which she used ClaimBuster against her own manual work. Although ClaimBuster found almost the same amount of fake information and did it faster than her, it missed some important information which was only partially true and could be defined as misinformation. She cited the example of a sentence about climate change, a topic both political and scientific, which contained a subtle judgment: minimizing the impact of human activity on global warming. The ClaimBuster was not able to point out the doubtful tone of the article.\n\nHowever, AI has also promising results in newsroom practice. &ldquo; The New York Times uses &ldquo;Perspective&rdquo; a Google tool, one of the best for comment moderation&rdquo; - mentioned Stefan Hall, World Economic Forum. He also highlighted the benefits of the MTI-based Portico to reduce toxicity in an online environment, as well as Twitter&rsquo;s own strategy to try and address disinformation, particularly bots and trolls. &ldquo; I think the Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Perspective&rdquo; is probably the most likely to be available in other countries.&rdquo; - pointed out Hall. - &ldquo;They have a human editor involved so there is always someone who makes the ultimate decision. However, many companies are looking into that.&rdquo;\n\nWilfried Runde stressed the importance of the journalist&rsquo;s judgment in the process - &ldquo; the result will always be left with the journalist in the newsroom.&rdquo; This applies to Truly Media, a tool developed three years ago by Deutsche Welle and the Athens Technology Center in Greece. The technology is based on open-source engines, such as [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/), which reverse-searches images. It is used for example by Amnesty International in their investigations, or in the European Parliament to verify scientific material. Its main purpose is to verify the authenticity of user-created content - but the final decision lies with the person who interprets these findings.\n\nMattia Peretti also mentioned a UK-based fact-checking charity Full Fact during European Youth Science and Media Day. It monitors major newspapers and broadcast news, as well as parliamentary sources, using the available subtitles and also text to speech conversion.\n\nLucas Graves from the Reuters Institute Oxford described two other available automated fact-checking projects, the [Duke Reporters Lab](https://reporterslab.org/) and [Chequeado](https://chequeado.com/). The Duke Reporters Lab is a hub at Duke University. They have developed [Tech &amp; Check Alerts](https://reporterslab.org/tech-and-check/), which helps journalists spot questionable claims in the local news - and sends a list of them in a daily newsletter. Their other new project, FactStream, offers live fact-checking of major political events via a mobile app. Its first public test came during the 2018 State of the Union address, when during the speech reportedly more than 3,000 people used the app.\n\nFinally, Chequeado is a fact-checking nonprofit based in Buenos Aires. In its current version, the program monitors presidential speeches and about 30 media outlets across Argentina to find claims to check. Another planned feature matches statements against previous fact-checks, and against official statistics, in order to automatically generate a draft for a human fact-checker to review. The platform will be shared with other fact-checking organizations in South America, and with news organizations interested in political fact-checking, but at the moment it is available only in Spanish.\n\nThere are many other AI-based fact-checkers available, such as [ClaimBuster](https://idir.uta.edu/claimbuster/), the [veracity.ai](http://veracity.ai/) or the [Factmata](https://factmata.com/). The technology is constantly improving, but will it ever become a reliable solution against the misinformation and the fake news?\n\nSolutions? Education\n\nSo, can we overcome misinformation, or is it here to stay permanently? People working with hybrid threats and information warfare stress the role of education and raising awareness in overcoming this threat.\n\nAfter Russia [illegally annexed Crimea](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/03/15/revisiting-2014-annexation-of-crimea-pub-68423) and started a war with Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian media professionals spotted how the society was manipulated with misinformation for many years. Their first response was to start debunking the myths, but the long-term strategy required educating young people. Media professionals [started a project where school children could learn](https://www.stopfake.org/en/stopfake-helps-schools-to-teach-media-literacy/) to discern non-objective information.\n\nThough, the responsibility lies not only on journalists. &ldquo; People always assume that science journalists are experts in fake news and know how to change them. But that's not true,&rdquo; said Mi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107, &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; news editor and Chair of the Board of the Association of British Science Writers. &ldquo;I don't believe in the idea of media manipulating people. We are here to report, not to change peoples mind,&rdquo; he responded about the ways science journalism can fight fake news. &ldquo; There is already too much manipulation outside. It should be the role of education and teachers. They are the expertise you need, not journalists.&rdquo; Therefore, the knowledge must be passed to teachers as well.\n\nThis applies to the use of AI in fighting misinformation. As Wilfried Runde of Deutsche Welle said, &ldquo; publishers must be open about the AI tools that they are using in their work&rdquo;. If a media outlet is using AI for editing, data analysis, preparing material, etc., they must be transparent about their tools and encourage the public to participate in giving feedback. This would benefit both the media and the society - by showing how technology helps us create reliable content, spot the misinformation, and reestablish trust, crucial to democratic societies. But also explaining why AI cannot replace human judgment or ethics, or the need for personal contact in acquiring sources and first-hand information.\n\nTherefore, it seems that humans are not entirely alone in the fake news war. Technology has already developed useful tools for facilitating the journalists&rsquo; work, such as fact-checkers, and the industry does not stop progressing. However, these options still require human supervision and they seem to carry the risk of biases, mistakes and the possibility of human misuse. So journalists are here to stay. But they must stay alter and show how our values of democracy, transparency, and freedom of speech are being preserved in this super dynamic, technologically enhanced environment.", "created_at": "2019-06-09 08:22:43.298777", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 18:52:28.732597", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1771, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 275.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45291, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 8534, "post_number": 51, "raw": "Bristol is a very strange city.\nIt is amazingly wealthy in places (historic and new wealth) and was largely built on the back of the transatlantic slave trade during the 17th/18th Century. Over the years it decline and the power and prestige moved to cities nearby (Bath, specifically) but it experienced a renaissance in the 1960's (largely as a result of immigration from the Caribbean) Becasue of the change in demographics it became a very cheap city to live in, and it attracted a large number of artists, performers and social activists to it between 1970-1990. There were some race riots during the 1980's between settled Caribbean populations and poorer white communities. Mostly down to bad community management and racist policing tactics. This kept the more conservative elements in UK society away from the city, but attracted the revelotionary, bohemian and hippy fringe to the city. As a result the city now has 2 distinct sides: the old rich (University, banking, defence contracting) and the social activism/artistic exploration (Stoke Croft area, Banksy, Portishead (band) Dubstep (music genre))\n\nThe standard of living is split between the very rich (who often live in old 3-4 story townhouses, or outside the city), the general middle classes (who have larger properties around the city centre) and the poorer neighbourhoods (which are often a mix of long-term poorer white working class families and artists/social activists, etc) Overall the standard of living is very high, and it is known for being similar to areas of North London, but with a slower pace of life. A vibrant arts, performance, circus, music and festival scene can be found throughout the city.\nThe Alt-currency was created outside of the government structure, and therefore it started as a grassroots movement, embraced by the inhabitants and community before it was accepted by the government. Even now, i don't think you can use the alt-currency to pay for any government services. Instead it is used as a way of keeping local money in the local environment (a bit like Disney dollars)\nAs with most of the UK, it isn't about the government encouraging cooperatives, but rather just not being able to stop them or shut them down. Slowly, places like Bristol have seen community leaders and social activists make their way into the local government structures, which in turn leads to a faster acceptance and pace of change. But this is never top-down.\n\nI would need to go back to Bristol and spend a few days looking around and asking to find out any more (which i will try to do anyway (I want to see my friend))\n\nHope that helps.\nI'm not an expert on the city or it's structures, but that is my take on what happened/is happening", "created_at": "2018-06-02 13:12:27.971233", "updated_at": "2018-06-02 13:12:27.971233", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [45234], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51811, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 9623, "post_number": 12, "raw": "oops, just reread your post...of course those names must be already taken.

This is important, it appears, because in our research transactions within an (indigenous) group most often took the form of gifting & reciprocal societal obligations. This necessarily involves reputation, development of trustworthiness and the whole associated raft of personality attributions. The problem of \"free riders\" was simply dealt with through shaming or in extreme cases shunning, a form of expulsion from the group that often was an existential threat.\n\nMonetary systems evolved, if memory serves, from barter. Barter was the form of transaction usual between \"strangers\", often etymologically derivative from \"enemies\" & sometimes the very same word. In this case, it was always desirable to get a good deal, that is, \"buy low, sell high\". It's not hard to see how this worked out.\n\nIt would seem more ideal, in a SF world, to once again involve reputation (trustworthiness?) as an element in a value exchange. This would seem a requirement for a world where everyone is a member of the group & no one mentally projected across a border to the status of being \"other\". This would undercut the basis for war, religion & ruthless expropriation & exploitation that led to today's climate crisis. There are more issues here, as well, including a base psychological construct, but perhaps that strays too far from the point at hand.\n\nFor our 2 cents, we would certainly like to see the point you raised well considered for inclusion.

Je parle d'information au sens \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et je dirais \"donn\u00e9es\" ou \"data\" lorsque cette information est transform\u00e9e et devient utilisable. Disons qu'elles produisent du bruit et cela est jet\u00e9 \u00e0 la poubelle, ignor\u00e9. Pour rendre utilisable cette production, il faut des outils et inventer des outils.\n\nPour donner un exemple, les entreprises de vente recueillent les noms et adresses de leurs clients, leur \u00e2ge, leur profession, leurs go\u00fbts. Amazon le fait tr\u00e8s bien. Mais imaginons simplement que vous rassemblliez les adresses, les \u00e2ges, le sexe des clients dans un cube. Vous cherchez ue fa\u00e7on d'ordonner tout cela et petit \u00e0 petit vous trouvez des correlations qui n'apparaissent pas autrement et qui vous donnent \u00e0 penser. Donc vous avez produit de la connaissance. Peut-\u00eatre que l'on ne sait pas quoi en faire, comment faire, mais \u00e7a donne \u00e0 penser.\n\nUn exemple plus pr\u00e9cis. Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, nous avons men\u00e9 une petite exp\u00e9rience pour d\u00e9montrer que l'on pouvait conna\u00eetre les groupes qui se forment au sein d'une messagerie. Les sciologues et psychologues voulaient analyser les contenus des mails. La loi l'interdit sauf autorisation de chaque producteur de mail. Nous nous sommes partis d'une autre hypoth\u00e8se, tout mail dans un groupe poss\u00e8de des caract\u00e9ristiques visibles en dehors du contenu: il a un poids sp\u00e9cifique et il est lu dans un d\u00e9lai restreint. Nous avons ainsi pu montrer que des personnes affirmant ne pas travailler ensemble formaient un groupe de travail sp\u00e9cifique mais, nouvelle connaissance, certaines personnes \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du groupe ont alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elles travaillaient ensemble dans le cadre d'un autre r\u00e9seau. Bien s\u00fbr, nous avions travaill\u00e9 sur des messages stock\u00e9s ce qui a permis de mener des interviews avant et apr\u00e8s notre analyse. Cela a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser.\n\nC'est un peu le travail que fait nombre d'agence de renseignements, cf. Philosophie du renseignement d'Isaac Ben-Isra\u00eal.\n\nUn autre point important est la repr\u00e9sentation que l'on donne au bit d'information et \u00e0 son organisation. Chaque mode de repr\u00e9sentation ajoute et retranche des possibilit\u00e9s de connaissance. Une m\u00eame information transform\u00e9 en en nombre, mot ou image, ne conduit pas \u00e0 des pens\u00e9es identiques, n'attire pas les m\u00eames significations.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-25 19:53:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.443665", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74336, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13206, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-04-15 07:08:46.061740", "updated_at": "2020-04-15 07:08:46.061740", "deleted_at": "2020-04-15 13:52:01.136414", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72588, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 223, "raw": ":rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl: Peak Matthias.", "created_at": "2020-03-26 18:22:47.123477", "updated_at": "2020-03-26 18:22:47.123477", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 24.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [72584], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59312, "user_id": 5092, "topic_id": 9878, "post_number": 35, "raw": "Hi @mariaeuler I'll be at Stockholm airport, and with a bit of luck it works out just before boarding!\n\n[Sent from a mobile, please apologize the brevity and typos.]", "created_at": "2019-09-15 16:10:06", "updated_at": "2019-09-15 16:15:22.986523", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 32.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59310], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72288, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 12945, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Thanks, some guys and I are compiling a list in Italian for websites of this kind (do you want to join us?). https://github.com/mstn/awesome-coronavirus-italia (vicinosicuro is already there! there is one for Milan https://www.filaindiana.it/)\n\nI do not use twitter.

Our goal is to bring together partners interested in the EU Green Deal Calls into a space where the EIT Climate-KIC community can contribute to or accelerate consortia building and develop project ideas together, based on the extended relationships they have developed as part of this community over the past 10 years. \n\n \n\nThroughout this online event you will be able to:\n\n* Join one of the 20 breakout rooms matching each topic of the EU Green Deal Call.\n* Pitch your needs, challenges, or ideas for collaboration to other partners.\n* Exchange information on currently forming consortia and possibly join forces with EIT Climate-KIC and other community partners.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we have been using our online collaboration and visualisation platform, Exaptive, to capture and visualise interest from across our community on Green Deal calls. The intention with this mapping is to promote transparency and to facilitate and encourage matchmaking across the community. If you have not yet entered your interest in a specific Green Deal Call, please find [here](https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-map-interest-in-European-Green-Deal-collaboration-in-Exaptive_Sept-2020.pdf) our guide on how to indicate your interest in collaborating on Green Deal Calls on Exaptive (available on the Partner Information Page). We encourage you to update your Exaptive profile with information regarding your fields of interest and areas of specialisation ahead of the Climate-KIC Community Green Deal Networking event. \n\n \n\n[Click here](https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Agenda-CKIC-Community-Green-Deal-Networking-Event.pdf) to see our draft agenda for the day \u2013 available under the 'Updates and Announcements' section of the Partner Information Page (password: ckicpartner).\n\n \n\nTo register for this event please click [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=OYmBKPsKskS2wo6wpXzKZCzqzGEquTFMrnPHnB_xdeNUOTZRSzMzUDFRSEJVQU1LVkpMV01FSzc0My4u).", "created_at": "2020-10-26 14:16:15.274605", "updated_at": "2020-10-26 14:32:20.640438", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 61.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36629, "user_id": 3973, "topic_id": 7016, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Great!

In July we received the bad news \u2013 none of them is getting funded. What went wrong? \n\nHorizon 2020 applications are evaluated by independent experts and the process includes three phases: individual evaluation, consensus group and panel review. More details about it can be found [here.](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/from-evaluation-to-grant-signature/evaluation-of-proposals/eval_process_results_en.htm) Each criterion (Excellence, Impact, Quality &amp; Efficiency of the Implementation) can bring 5 points max., which makes the total of 15 points.\n\n**EPICS \u2013 Epistemological Insights on Citizen Science (total score 12)**\n\n**Positive points:**\n\n- The project was evaluated as ambitious and progressive with clear research objectives, methodology and work plan, management structures and procedures, complementary partners and very well addressed resource attribution. Direct participation of citizen scientists in delivering the targeted actions is considered innovative as well as the application of participatory design and ethnographical research methods. Inclusion of grassroots initiatives, public and societal engagement are particularly strong. Exploitation goals, data management plan and communications plan are detailed. Outputs are aligned with impacts.\n\n**Shortcomings:**\n\n- Activities only partially address the topic, limited focus on incentivising career scientists - little is said of plans for the identification of barriers and enablers to their involvement. The targeted knowledge base of existing citizen science projects is not significant and the involvement of policy makers not evident. Gender dimension is only broadly considered (but not how it will be addressed in research terms). Dissemination is not fully detailed nor how results will be exploitable by wider stakeholder audiences. Some minor remarks include potential risks of combining citizens science and ethnography which are not fully considered; the rationale for the attribution of lead roles not in all cases fully described.\n\n**EVENTS \u2013 Understanding the Evolution of Society and Science through Citizen Science (total score: 7**) This was a different type of call, evaluated on only two dimensions. Maximum score is 10, not 15.\n\n**Positive points:**\n\n- Approach and methodology are evaluated as innovative; objectives consistent with the exploitation strategy; the knowledge gap well investigated with objectives addressing it. The proposal is beyond the state of the art in relation to the ethnographic approach. The use of stakeholder knowledge is clear and the gender dimension precisely specified.\n\n**Shortcomings:**\n\n- The topic description in the work program is only partially discussed, the objectives may be achievable but not specific or easy to measure. The concepts of trust and accountability can be interpreted in many ways and need to be examined critically. Literature on the analysis and clarification of these concepts were not fully taken into account. The fellowship program lacks evidence; greater representation from ethical experts is needed. \n- Little evidence is provided of how participants will yield insights into the reproducibility of citizen ethnography. Certain claims, such as to improve citizen science projects, are difficult to assess. Not enough details on how knowledge base will be significantly advanced beyond the state of the art. It should be more clear how the results will contribute to the expected impacts. Vague statements should be avoided.\n\n_Future calls to consider related to citizens science (all opening on 10 December 2019 with deadline 15 April 2020, more details available in the [work programme](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2018-2020/main/h2020-wp1820-swfs_en.pdf)):_\n\n_SwafS-19-2020: Taking stock and re-examining the role of science communication_\n_SwafS-23-2020: Grounding RRI in society with a focus on citizen science_\n_SwafS-27-2020: Hands-on citizen science and frugal innovation (this one especially suitable to \u201cre-use\u201d the EPICS application)_\n_SwafS-29-2020: The ethics of technologies with high socio-economic impact_\n_SwafS-30-2020: Responsible Open Science: an ethics and integrity perspective_\n_SwafS-31-2020: Bottom-up approach to build SwafS knowledge base_\n\n\n**CYCLOPS \u2013 Cycle of Creativity: a Leading Open Intellectual Property System for the European Union (total score: 9.50)**\n\n**Positive points:**\n\n- The overall scope and goals are very ambitious, the proposal is well structured and demonstrates awareness of the current issues. Some WPs are well thought through (WP5 and WP2 \u2013 \u201cGiving all stakeholders a voice\u201d, Edgeryders leading) \u2013 very likely to lead to new insights. The outputs are clearly defined and very well linked with the expected impacts and there is a possibility for the network to be created beyond the scope of the project. Critical risks for implementation and contingencies are addressed and management well described.\n\n**Shortcomings:**\n\n* Short duration for the proposed activities, the feasibility is not justified. Much of the work is unspecified and open, some research questions are unclear and vague. The results to be achieved are numerous and connected with each other in a rather complex way. Work packages focused on collecting the views of stakeholders are limited by a reduced set of languages and it is not clearly explained how the selection of languages, countries and issues is representative of the digital single market, its cultural and societal make-up. More detailed interfacing with senior lawyers would be needed in order to prevent mischaracterization and simplification of law for the purposes of empirical work.\n* The interdisciplinary approach is not clearly expressed in all sections. The distribution of activities foresees very reduced cooperation among the partners while dissemination and communication activities lack details. The risks related to the project\u2019s ambitious goals are not sufficiently considered.\n\n**AI SET \u2013 Arts Inspired Socio Economic Transformation (total score: 7)**\n\n**Positive points:**\n\n- The concept is compelling and has imaginative components especially in terms of how a material object can collect and mediate experiences of mobility, social change, place and identity, as well as improve well-being among returning migrant populations. It is a bold, ambitious and multi-stranded project that combines data-driven enterprises with the everyday worlds of craft, objects and local, regional and global populations. The proposal is strong on stakeholder knowledge, the work plan clear and work packages appropriately structured. Consortium has a high degree of expertise, art specific approaches and competences in the field of digital economy are well covered. Particular strength: online element involving the ethnographic mapping \u2013 carefully defined and given adequate weight. (great point for us!)\n\n**Shortcomings:**\n\n- Connections between the existing field of research and the concrete case are not sufficiently described and links between socio-economic transformation and the core issues of the project not fully addressed. It is not clear how the social inclusion will be achieved or how the project will contribute to the further integration of the arts in policies and strategic goals of the EU. The objectives remain general. \n* The use of social media and mobilising communities through online methods are not sufficiently explained (!), the development of new products and services not given sufficient attention. The project\u2019s innovative character is also limited in terms of scope and impact. Academic knowledge and interdisciplinary approach are not considered well enough. Dissemination activities not concrete, different target groups not given enough attention and it is not clear how the partners would complement each other.\n\nWhat is certainly clear from the evaluations is that our methodology is recognized to be innovative and our workpackage very relevant for the consortia. There is a need to stress more the interdisciplinary approach and emphasize the close collaboration between the partners. The dissemination part was often evaluated as weak. \n\nWhat next? @alberto and I will be looking in more detail the upcoming calls to find the best way to use some of the proposals above and improve them based on this feedback.\n\nStay tuned!", "created_at": "2019-08-27 14:54:10.717961", "updated_at": "2019-08-30 09:40:32.693591", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1275, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 148.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 2915, 5, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72946, "user_id": 6331, "topic_id": 12947, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Hi All\n\nThanks again.

It has enabled the participants to co-create the events by allowing any participant to create an idea (a dream) of something they want to do, set a budget, and then letting all participants decide what to fund collectively with tokens representing a part of their membership fee.\n\nDreams is a prime example of technology coming out of the participatory culture and something that has good potential for wider adoption and usage. But adopting this platform and process for your own event requires a lot of specific technical know-how, as a single deploy can only handle a single event, meaning that you need to set up and deploy your own version of Dreams to use it for your own event. \n\nRewriting Dreams to allow multiple organisations and events to use the same instance would lower the barrier for it to be used by not only more and smaller burns that do not have the resources to set up and run its own deploy, but also opening up the possibility to use it for other types of events and gatherings and in other networks.\n\n**Building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a multi-tenant Dreams**\nI've talked with @hugi about leading the development of an MVP funded by Participio, using a similar tech stack as [Realities](https://github.com/Edgeryders-Participio/realities), another Participio project (with the biggest difference being using a more traditional database here):\n\n- UI: React, Next.js, Apollo Client\n- API: GraphQL server using Node.js, Express and Apollo, with a Postgres database\n\n**Goals of MVP**\n- allow multiple organisations and events on the same instance\n- make it possible for a smaller event to adopt the Dreams process without needing any technical know-how (admin of event might need to do some non-technical manual work, like giving out tokens to the correct members)\n\n**MVP user stories**\n- to be determined\n\n**Future development possibilities but outside of MVP scope**\n- integrate with [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/) to use it as the financial backend, to handle the money part and expense reimbursements, reducing a lot of manual and tedious work that takes place today\n- build support for custom integrations per organization, like Keycloak (used by Borderland for single sign on), Loomio, ticketing, etc\n\n**Why a rewrite?**\n- **Tech debt and developer happiness**. The current platform is built in Ruby on Rails, and has developed some tech debt over the years. I was part of the Participio [Dreams hack in March](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dreams-hack-in-march/9362), and the general feeling I sensed among the developers was that it was a pretty cumbersome to work with. Small changes taking a long time to implement. While an experienced Rails developer would have no trouble being very productive in Rails I think it becomes increasingly hard to find people wanting to work on this tech stack, myself included..\n\n- Another factor is the benefit of using a **similar tech stack** as Realities (which is also, arguably, a more modern and popular tech stack) and making it easy for developers to switch seamlessly between them. Using GraphQL there are some neat things you can do in stitching two schemas together, reducing the data barriers between the platforms.\n\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* Name.

Speaking of which, relevant to this is David Graeber's An Anthropological Theory of Value from 2002. The big exception is Amartya Sen: I have on my list the 1987 \"On Ethics and Economics\" and 2009's \"The Idea of Justice\". And this is related to John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\" from 1971. I have e-books of all these (except Graeber) if you'd like.\n\nObviously Smith was a moral philosopher, and even as late as Albert Marshall, he became an economist to help people. At this stage there are still those folks, mostly in development economics, which is my early love.\n\nThe problem with creating better societies is the humans -- it requires better people. We love to hate corporations, but I tend to this that hatred mostly comes from envy, and until we breed societies which train their children in love and care for their fellows, we will not be able to replace them with something better simply by setting up different structures.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n*Phillip *", "created_at": "2020-04-24 03:23:19", "updated_at": "2020-04-24 03:27:45.994140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 216, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74907], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60721, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 11020, "post_number": 6, "raw": "ok: 8th Oct. 15:00 Exki -Martin", "created_at": "2019-10-05 11:07:15.070985", "updated_at": "2019-10-05 11:07:15.070985", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60720], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84534, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 14531, "post_number": 17, "raw": "yep, thought so.. ok all clear!", "created_at": "2020-10-07 13:57:56.299093", "updated_at": "2020-10-07 13:57:56.299093", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 16.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84532], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62338, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 164, "raw": "[quote=\"natalia_skoczylas, post:163, topic:10217\"]\nAlso, we need the SLO/EN button on top of the first page and the access to Slovenian version (I shared the slovenian language version of the text above in a google doc)\n[/quote]\n\nBeing able to switch between two different languages on the new installation is a new requirement that was not in the original specification.

Not a statistician myself, but I took several undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in statistics. I can do simple statistical models, and understand more sophisticated ones. \n\nPeople around me, I find, are made anxious by statistics on COVID-19, just like you say, @MariaEuler. I try to help, by making really stupid examples: \"if fatality is 1% or reported cases, and reported cases are underestimated by a factor 2, that means one infected person in 200 dies. Imagine you are playing a football tournament, and there are  18 teams. Now imagine one player is picked randomly and pulled out of the tournament. That's one person, out of 18 teams. It does not seem like many, but on the end it is not *zero people*. That one person could be you! Does it feel risky to you?\" \n\nI consider myself lousy at statistics, for an economist. But I spent a long time staring at probability distributions, and eventually that made me acquire a kind of a superpower. All statisticians have it. This: *I can hold different states of the world in my head at the same time*. I can look at COVID-19 reported cases, and see various scenarios, from bad epidemics + recession + back to business to full-on zombie apocalypse. So people ask me \"well, Mr. Scientist, so what will happen? Which one is it?\" And I say \"We don't know. All of these outcomes are possible, and none is certain.\" For me, this is a very reasonable answer, but people sometimes get frustrated, because they would like it to be either one, or the other. \n\nAnecdotally, however, it seems that these conversations help my non-statistically minded friends in some way. Maybe it's just monkey see, monkey do: \"hey, this statistician dude is contemplating these horrific scenarios, and yet he is not running howling in the streets and resorting to cannibalism, so things cannot be that bad\". Or maybe things *are* that bad (and they are, with some probability!), but there is something empowering in someone, anyone, having the ability to stare into the abyss, and still deploy rational thinking to try and come up with a thought-through response. Maybe this ability is even infectious, like a virus, but a benevolent one. \n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences? @matthias? @trythis? @mstn? @msanti?", "created_at": "2020-03-16 17:29:34.523273", "updated_at": "2020-03-27 13:36:32.310791", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 393, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 190.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 8, 5, 6358], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55056, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10103, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Haha, it's cool!

And quite often statistics make it feel like looking on from the outside while you are actually directly in the middle of it. **Even if you know that you or your loved ones are exactly as likely as this statistic says in numbers to become part of it, even if you understand it intellectually, the human brain is very bad at \u201cfeeling statistics\u201d.** \n\nJust last week I had a first-hand experience of becoming part of a different Covid19 unrelated statistic I had known of but not really felt fully until I became an affected part of, and maybe I will write about that at some point when I feel up to it.

For those who might be reading this that haven't read it - its very relevant to OpenCare. He starts out by describing two watersheds in modern times. The first in 1913 when Western medicine reached a point where a patient had a better than 50-50 chance that trained doctors would provide better treatment than anyone else. When precisely the second watershed took place is harder to determine\u00a0but its the point at which the institutions\u00a0of modern industrial society started to no longer serve\u00a0their over-riding purpose and peversely humanity starts to serve the institution. He saw this pattern particularly in the institutions of modern medicine but in all other professions.\n\n<em>\"I believe that society must be reconstructed to enlarge the contribution of autonomous individuals and primary groups to the total effectiveness of a new system of production designed to satisfy the human needs which it also determines. In fact, the institutions of industrial society do just the opposite.\"</em>\n\nSo it's a bit like the examples you've shared - and as every craftsperson knows, you need\u00a0different tools for different jobs. And I think where the chaordic path is helpful is that we also need different spaces/practices for different purposes.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-08 10:14:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.639263", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 268, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 3.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62205, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11237, "post_number": 10, "raw": "it's like we have totally lost agency.

How much do you think about your own retirement? What do you think about? And what do you avoid thinking about?**\n\nI think about it a lot. I started 'really' working late (paid salary that contributes towards social security) and I expect to have very poor funds by the time I retire. I have always been very active in the circles where I operate, but have not thought about retirement until I got my first official salary and started making estimations for the future. I might either never retire or I might need to invent a way to live a very modest life in my old age. \n\n**How about work, hobbies, family life, leisure, pleasure... Which activities from your present life would you like to keep doing? Which things would you like to never do again?**\n\nI don't like doing work that I don't believe in.

The 'dream you'. How do you get there? Which new skills and what knowledge do you want to acquire?**\n\nI need to make better use of what I have done so far. For example, invest my savings in something that would raise its value without me doing work. I know this is a purely capitalist thought but I feel that in order to continue working on things I really like, I need financial security that does not depend on selling my ideas on the actual market\n\n**Imagine your housing situation and the people around you (or their absence). Who are you surrounded by in your retirement?<br />Where and how would you like to live?**\n\nI hope to live with my partner and see my children often. I hope that we will often be many in my home or in any of their homes. \n\n**If you know people who have retired, was there something to learn from their experience and approach? Could you share their impressions?**\n\nWhen my parents retired they were never as busy. My father could finally do only things he likes without distractions from paid work (e.g. teaching). I hope to get the chance to live that. \n\n**How do you imagine sustaining yourself financially? Maybe you have a plan, a tip, or an idea, that you would like to share?**\n\nI save money. I hope to buy a place to live in my retirement and have enough funds to live off. Ideally, I would have a nice retirement monthly income.

Shortly after my PhD, I left academia behind to work in the industry, working very hard to not become a manager. Which is becoming a problem, caring about people and how they work (i.e. in a fulfilling way or not), but not about post/turbo-capitalism and it's hierarchies. At least it seems to be working out for now: I am lucky and happy to work in a flat company. (We have no managers, we unbundled the tasks of the last one - our former CEO - a year ago.) There, I am involved in understanding and evolving our so-called 'flatland'. That is, engaging and enabling people, solving problems, creating tools, playing with concepts and practices. (All that while I'm also working as a senior system designer.) In a very real sense, I am working with what Cory Doctorow calls 'the coordination problem'. Even more so, in a way similar to Walkaway's 'Belt and Braces' inn (or at least I try). I'm one of the lucky ones.\n\nI would very much like to work with the Science Fiction Economics Lab. I may have cheated by name-dropping Walkaway already. Yet in case it is not clear, the economics was my favorite part of Walkaway, one that doesn't go away despite the intervening years. It resonated because it's radical and yet plausible, in a way that other sci-fi is not. It is this plausibility that pokes at the geek inside me, to find it in real life and make it work. And I am doing exactly that, to the degree that I can. Yet I think it would be more fun doing it together, not to mention more efficient :slight_smile: .\n\nHaving said all that, unfortunately economics is not my topic. What I will be bringing to the table is rigorous analysis from distributed systems:\n\n* p2p systems\n* social graphs\n* smart grids\n* systems-of-systems\n\nIn the past, I have published on maximizing happiness in matchings (think kidney exchange programs), as well as making renewables work financially on a local level (think micropayments before blockchain was cool).\n\nIn the last few years I have been studying and working on something completely different: what motivates people and how successful communities work. This includes a variety of topics:\n\n* designing decision making processes,\n* conflict resolution,\n* ways to lower the bar to participation,\n* achieving more fair outcomes. \n\nTrying to describe my interests, let me give you a list of (presumably) relevant works of fiction - some big on utopia, some handling economics - that piqued my interest.

Everyone is releasing previously paywalled content, offering help, creating resources and directories. Is the communitarian Internet back? The question is important, because Edgeryders considers itself a virtual community, one of the last of the original, early wave virtual communities. We were born as a response to the previous crisis, the 2008 financial collapse. In the wake of COVID-19, we are mobilizing, just like everybody else ([example ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/12962), [other example ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/12886)). But: are we doing enough? Are we making the right moves?\n\n![|20x20](https://edgeryders.eu/user_avatar/edgeryders.eu/ton/40/10710_2.png)[\"Is the communitarian Internet back in the wake of COVID-19?\" A conversation with Howard Rheingold](https://edgeryders.eu/t/is-the-communitarian-internet-back-in-the-wake-of-covid-19-a-conversation-with-howard-rheingold/12971/12)\n\n> * there is a long list of unconnected initiatives out there currently. Looking at a range of them here in the Netherlands, while some seem to have some substance, many others seem more a coping strategy that keeps one busy but has no impact or meaning on the originator\u2019s scope of action or anyone else\u2019s agency. Kind of like the way I keep a spreadsheet with case numbers in NL, providing a sense of control or something, but then announcing it to the world as yet another Covid dashboard for coders and designers to contribute to.\n> At the same time initiatives that might have a real impact are invisible and never mentioned online unless they become visible once creating such impact. (e.g. my brother in law\u2019s 3d printer company has approached all businesses and factories that use their printers to donate printing capacity, creating a global networked printing facility, and now discussing with manufacturers (like Phillips) and health ministries how to deploy that network to print respirator parts and masks where needed. It won\u2019t be publicly announced as a bottom-up initiative, and it may not be publicly mentioned at all ever.) How do we filter wheat and chaff on a list of initiatives, or do we have a role in guiding others to potentially more meaningful activities and away from the coping projects like my spreadsheet/ other\u2019s shiny dashboards?\n\n**What these exchanges and many more we have had here over the years, is the need for people to reach out beyond our respective \u201chomes\u201d on the internet, and interact in other spaces.**\n\nTo find and make visible the unsung heroes and invisible efforts required to achieve impact in tackling the current and future crises.\n\n**This needs to move beyond collecting static repositories of information like links or manuals.**  Rather we need a combination of first hand accounts, conversations as well as dedicated people to synthesise and structure it all into concrete calls for participation/support. Then carry the weight of coordinating the people who do show up to help.\n\n**In the end it all comes down to building meaningful, active, relationships between a lot of people.**  Building, growing and activating dense networks. Making visible and accessible the knowledge carried within these networks, yes. But more importantly, making it possible to find, learn and interact with the individuals with whom we can get things done.\n\n**Our mission with this effort is to contribute towards this and engage others to do the same within their own settings.**  Because we believe this is needed for communities and societies as a whole to get better at responding to these crises in the future.\n\n### Are people paid to work on projects?\n\n* Whenever possible, we try to find money to pay for people\u2019s time. Our ability to secure resources relies on a lot of unpaid work such as researching and writing grant applications. We all pitch into this and whenever paid work opportunities are born out of our collective conversations, they are advertised on the community platform: community members who either have, or demonstrate aptitude and will to quickly develop, the required skills are then first for the paid work opportunities.\n* Our reasoning around this is that we prioritise pay for people who carry the brunt of the \u201cboring\u201d work like coordination, or administration which requires significant commitment, specialised skills and personal accountability. Freelance work which requires a concentrated full time effort for more than a day or two is next on the priority list. These often require significant administrative overhead due to the complex resource management and reporting requirements attached to our funding sources. What is easiest for us to cover is small expenses e.g for servers, materials or rental of equipment.\n\n### Why so much emphasis on documenting what people are doing and publishing online here? \nThe Edgeryders approach to documentation has two elements - interviewing people and telling their stories. Then structuring information from the conversations into calls to action that anyone can then take on. \n\nThe storytelling is necessary for understanding and connecting with the people behind the initiative that needs support. As well as to make sure their efforts, and those of the people who contribute to making them a success, are recognised. This makes it easier for them to draw more engagement and resources to support their work. When this takes place on the edgeryders platform it lowers the cost of coordination for everyone involved. Because we have community managers to welcome each person who shows up and help them find the right conversations, people and tasks for them.\n\n### Why use now.edgeryders.eu to host the video calls instead of say ZOOM?\nOnce you set up a room on now.edgeryders.eu it is always open for anyone with an edgeryders.eu account. You can invite people to spontaneously drop in whenever to say hi, ask questions or let everyone know how things are going. No need to book appointments, write emails etc - it keeps things light, flexible and social for everyone! Let @MariaEuler know when you set up the room so we can organise ourselves to ensure there is always someone in the room to welcome people who show up).\n\n### Where does the data on the platform go?\n\n* **Sensing & Sensemaking:**  Edgeryders has developed a [stack of open source tools to turn large scale conversational data into collective intelligence ](https://sensestack.netlify.com/) (see our github repo). We use these tools to make interactive visualisations of what we are all posting on our community platform that anyone can use to get the bigger picture on what connections are being made between ideas, topics, projects, fields, experiences, places etc. And get a \u201cbigger picture\u201d sense of what all of this is telling us about the world around us. We regularly do training on how to set up and use them for your own work. Write to [alberto@edgeryders.eu](mailto:alberto@edgeryders.eu) to learn more about this.\n* **Distributed coordination:**  The tools also enable us see where there are clusters of people and projects which could better achieve impact with some alignment of practices, sharing of resources etc. We can see where there are overlapping areas of interest and focus our community management efforts towards building bridges, deepening relationships, seeding novel practices. To support others in doing this wherever they, we are building [a mooc on distributed collaboration ](https://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu/) that we will make freely available. write to [nadia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu).\n* **Research for public benefit:**  We regularly conduct action-oriented research projects around bigger issues.

For those not aware, a secret white supremacist rally was held on a Friday night at the campus of UVA.  It was filled with hundreds of angry white men, complete with tiki torches (yes really) and chats of \u201cblood and soil\u201d, a key slogan for the Nazi regimen.  Counter protestors were brutally attacked and the police were nowhere to be seen.  The next day, a large gathering of white supremacists went to a central park for a sanctioned (i.e. legal) march.  They were met by an even larger group of counter-protesters.  Conflict between the groups quickly escalated, and as video evidence has shown, the violence was clearly started by the white supremacists.  Non-violent counter-protesters were defended by anarchists, anti-fascists, communists, and other groups who embraced self defense and black bloc tactics.  The white supremacist march was shut down, and during a period of celebration and regrouping, a young white supremacist drove his car into the crowd, injuring dozens and killing a protester, Heather Heyer.  Other counter protesters were beaten with pipes in broad daylight.  Militia men walked through the streets of Charlottesville as if they were walking the streets of some foreign land, M-16\u2019s and body armor ready.  Throughout it all, the police were nowhere to be seen, \u201cprotecting the perimeter\u201d.  Solidarity demonstrations erupted across the country.  Trump offered a clear support of the growing fascist movement in the country, unwilling to push away his political base.  The liberal media is at a loss, unable to condemn the self-defence of the counter protestors but unwilling to acknowledge that the foundations of our society are crumbling.  The American Civil Liberties Union protects the fascists and white supremacists in the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d while the alt-right is clearly co-opting the tactics of liberalism and nationalism to increase their political power.  \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/59d165b6426f15483ea8386247c2e50be76136d5.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c6130e8bab3b379be2420b94120612ff423862fe.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\">\n\nAt the end of the month, as the debate in the mainstream media about Russia and tax codes and debt burdens trolled on, the rise of massive \u201csuperstorms\u201d loomed on the horizon of our southern coast.  Houston, the fourth largest city in the US, was hit by the most amount of rain to ever hit the US.  Large swaths of the city are still underwater, a week after the hurricane.  Many people have died, and it is clear that the devastation to the city is just beginning.  Many are arguing that Houston represents the paradigm of massive growth and infrastructure development without any thought to environmental concerns, adding the massive destruction.  In addition, almost a quarter of the refined gas supplied to the US comes through the refineries in Houston, many of which have been damaged.  Mixed with the flood waters runs gas and oil and untold other toxic chemicals, creating the beginnings of an environmental catastrophe.  <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a50f36cce257d2d0ba76ffe63d6efd4a0cf9b013.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"420\">\n\nAs the conversation around Hurricane Harvey shifts toward rebuilding, Hurricane Irma is on a straight path towards Miami, Florida.  Miami chronically suffers from daily flooding, again an example of development within floodplains without consideration to climate factors.  Who knows what damage a category 4 hurricane will do to the city.  Our thoughts go to the safety of the residents and all other life there.  Perhaps Irma will miss Florida, ironically a state where the government cannot use the term \u201cclimate change\u201d.  But right behind Irma is Hurricane Jose, their cousin Katia is battering the eastern coast of Mexico and who knows what other family members will show their face during this hurricane season.  In addition, the west coast of the US is on fire, with massive uncontrolled wildfires running across the mountain ranges.  In Bangladesh, a third of the country was flooded, suffering landslides that have killed hundreds of thousands.  As has been clearly shown throughout history, those affected the most by the ravages of capitalism are not the beneficiaries of these systems.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/15f9cddec84ff1a908451adfb36599caf52da8cf.jpg\" width=\"299\" height=\"168\">\n\nThe question of care looms behind all these thoughts.  How are we to provide care in the broadest sense when people drive cars into crowds?  When unsanctioned militia men walk armed down the street?  When we are being ravaged by storms that are literally larger than the entire state being hit?  The liberalism that infects this country, of trying to find compromise in everything and promotes a sense of powerlessness runs rampant in our culture.  We watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d rather than think that perhaps we have our own white walkers.  We worry about our careers and our next vacation.  I watch the people out of the window heading of to work, assuming that since NYC represents such a nidus of capitalism, that their job somehow continues to facilitate my own destruction.  I think of my own work in an ER, is my job any different?  Am I also continuing to worry about my own individual world, desperately trying to walk a fine line of caring about the world but not letting those thoughts actually influence my life? I ask myself, if I truly think that the fundamental structure of our economics and society are being threatened, why am I paying back my school loans?\n\nYet through all this depression, there is always hope.  Not that shitty optimism of the hippies or the progressives that are destroying our cultural sense of power.  Not the general hope that everything will be ok, which is such a comfort for the petit bourgeois of this country.  But a hope that we can find each other.  That we can have the courage to face this destruction, and while I do not wish for the superstorms and the violence, it is here and is not going away.  So let us embrace the fact that these represent potential vulnerabilities to the heart of neoliberal capitalism.  That the police will not protect us, that our careers will not save us.  \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/616a364c3e4f905b12bbffe61200ea5e4f04ef61.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"390\">\nOur work cannot be to bemoan the possibility of this destruction, but to build the alternative world that will build on the ashes of this culture.  This past weekend, I stared at the faces of my comrades, washed in the wondrous light of a campfire.  We planned and schemed ways to build a new world together, letting our visions intertwine themselves with the smoke, rising up to the stars above.  This hope exists everywhere.  The OpenVillage conversations are working through the logistical obstacles of coming up with ways of being together across the country.  As the Festival approaches, proposals about different ways to organize communities and tactical tools needed to rebuild worlds abound.  The OpenVillage Festival will be a step in the direction of building an international community that feels the glimmer of hope that a new way of being can be built.  But we must dedicate our lives to it.  I don\u2019t hold answers and often question my own complicity with this devastation.  But it is clear, we must find each other, hold each other through the depression and sadness, fight against the comfort of nihilism, protect our communities from those who would harm it and learn to care for ourselves in ways that can overcome the material destruction of whatever comes.  A new world is possible, we just have to walk it.\n\n \"We have nowhere to return to...

Edgeryders' Matrix addressbook](#heading--5)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Getting a Matrix account</h2>\n\nAs a collaborator on an Edgeryders project, you'll need a Matrix account (or more formally, a \"Matrix ID\"). It's simple:\n\n1. **Create an edgeryders.eu account.** Because your Matrix account username will be the same as your edgeryders.eu username.\n\n2. **Ask @matthias** to create an `@username:edgeryders.eu` Matrix account for you. Ask by direct message here on the edgeryders.eu platform, or by e-mail to matthias@edgeryders.eu. You will receive your password to your e-mail address.\n\n**How Matrix IDs look.** Matrix IDs have the form `@localpart:domainpart.tld`. Similar to e-mail addresses, they have a \"localpart\" and a \"domain part\". The punctuation is a bit different than in e-mail addresses to avoid confusing them. For Edgeryders, we are running our own Matrix software on our own server, so the \"domain part\" is always `edgeryders.eu`. The \"localpart\" is always the same as your edgeryders.eu username (in all-lowercase).\n\n**Do not use a federated Matrix account.** To collaborate on Edgeryders projects, please get a `@username:edgeryders.eu` account as instructed above. Because we disabled federation, it is not possible to get an account at a different Matrix homeserver (such as `:matrix.org`, available for free) and to use that to participate in Edgeryders' Matrix chats. The reasons for us disabling the federation features are:\n\n* There are still some bugs in Matrix for presence notifications across federated servers, which means users with an `:edgeryders.eu` account may not see people with `:matrix.org` accounts as online, and vice versa.\n\n* Chat messages in rooms with users from different Matrix homeservers are permanently stored on these multiple homeservers, not just on our own. This is a privacy / confidentiality issue (possibly even clashing with the GDPR), except if we would consistently use end-to-end encryption to enforce that these messages are stored in an encrypted manner. However, there are still some software issues with end-to-end encryption in Matrix and it is generally annoying to use, so it's not advisable to do this for cases like this where we have the alternative to keep all messages confined to our server.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Logging in to Element</h2>\n\n**In the browser.** We have an own Matrix server running and disabled federation with other Matrix servers, so all your messages are saved only on our own server. However, we do not have our own application installed to actually _use_ Matrix. Instead, you can use the free and open source software \"Element\" to communicate over Matrix.\n\nYou can log in as follows (normally you never log out, so this is a one-time thing per browser):\n\n1. Open this link in a new tab: https://app.element.io/#/login\n\n2. Choose: \"Sign in with: Username\".\n\n3. Enter your username in the form `@username:edgeryders.eu` , as found in the e-mail you received or in our \"Matrix addressbook\" below. You can not use your e-mail address for login because of the way we have set up our Matrix server.\n\n4. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or click into the password field. The software will now automatically change and fill some fields, so that you should see a message \"Sign in to your Matrix account on edgeryders.eu\". See under \"login issues\" below if you don't have that message.\n\n5. Enter your password (as received in the e-mail from @matthias).\n\n6. Click on <kbd>Sign in</kbd>.\n\n**Login issues in the browser.**\n\n* **\"Invalid homeserver discovery response.\"** If you see that error message, and the login screen still shows \"Sign in to your Matrix account on **matrix.org**\" instead of \"Sign in to your Matrix account on **edgeryders.eu**\", then your browser cannot figure out on which server your account has been registered. Try the following steps to fix this:\n\n    1. Disable Privacy Badger. [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) can prevent you from logging into the Matrix server. This issue was reported with Firefox Quantum 69.0 (64-bit) for Mac and Privacy Badger 2019.7.1.1. The problem went away after disabling Privacy Badger for the element.io website.\n\n    2. Disable other privacy enhancing extensions. It is possible that adblockers or privacy extensions like Ghostery block the requests to edgeryders.eu and matrix.edgeryders.eu for login. Try disabling these extensions on element.io, or first try if login works in a private window / incognito mode (where extensions are typically disabled already).\n\n    3. Enter the homeserver manually. This should always work, but is another manual step during login. After the message \"Sign in to your Matrix account on matrix.org\" click the link \"Change\" an in the field \"Homeserver URL\" enter `https://matrix.edgeryders.eu:8448` . Enter the URL exactly as given above. Even a small deviation like a trailing slash will make this fail, which is an issue we have [reported](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/4505).\n\n* **Firefox login issues.** Generally, Element works in a recent Firefox browser. However, if login does not work in Firefox using the normal procedure above, try it in a Firefox Private Window instead (see [issue #11844](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/11844)).\n\n**On a smartphone.** To be available on the go, you probably want to install a Matrix client software on your smartphone as well. For that, the Riot.im software is also available as mobile apps [for Android](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/element-android) and [for iOS](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/element-ios).\n\nHere is the login procedure for the Android app:\n\n1. Open the installed app, called \"Element (Riot.im)\" on the app icon.\n\n2. Click \"Get Started\", then click \"Log in with Matrix ID\".\n\n3. Enter your username in the form `@username:edgeryders.eu`, as found in the e-mail you received or in our \"Matrix addressbook\" below. You can not use your e-mail address for login because of the way we have set up our Matrix server.\n\n4. Enter your password (as received in the e-mail you received from @matthias).\n\n5. Click \"Sign in\".\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. First steps with your Matrix account</h2>\n\nAfter log in, here are some first steps to do in the Matrix software:\n\n1. **Accept the invitations.** Your Matrix account has already been invited to one or several rooms by the admin who created your account. So, please accept the invitation on the left side of the screen (when using Matrix in your browser). **Attention:** The \"Campfire\" is a public socializing corner where we invite everyone from Edgeryders and our networks with a Matrix account. So please don't put anything even remotely confidential there :)\n\n2. **Adapt your account settings.** Click the gear icon in the left bottom part to go to your account settings. There:\n\n    1. **Connect an e-mail address.** (Note: For now, it will be possible to find your Matrix account under this e-mail address on the vector.im identity server, so use one that you are ok with for this purpose.)\n\n    2. **Change your password \u2013 _this is important_**, because the one above was not safely transmitted via e-mail. Instructions: (1) first connect an e-mail address, as mentioned above, (2) change the password in the account settings, (3) click the confirmation link in the e-mail sent to your e-mail address, (4) after the confirmation \"password successfully changed\", ignore the warning about exporting and reimporting keys since you have not sent or read any encrypted messages by now.\n\n    3. **Change your display name \u2013  _also important_,** because important functionalities like mentions and invitations do not work as well if you do not do this. By default, you will appear as \"@username:edgeryders.eu\" in chat logs and as room name of your direct chats, which is ugly. We propose to set the display name to your localpart, so just \"username\" in this case, to keep things simple. Due to a [software bug](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/4477), you can't do this in one step yet. So change the display name to something else first, close the settings, then reopen it again and change it to the localpart of your Matrix ID (with lowercase first letter, please!).\n\n    4. **Add a profile picture.**\n\n    5. **Enable e-mail notifications.** There is an option in the account settings to do this for the e-mail address you just connected to your account. You will then get e-mails about messages received while you were offline / unresponsive.\n\n    6. **Enable @all notifications.** To  get everyone's attention in a long-running team chat where most people have set the notification level to \"Mentions only\", this is a nice trick. In line \"Notifications \u2192 Messages containing keywords\", click on \"keywords\" and enter \"@all\" (without the \"\"). Confirm, then set \"Messages containing keywords\" to \"Noisy\". You'll see a red message and get @mention equivalent notifications when somebody types @all.\n\n    7. **Enable \"New Composer &amp; Autocomplete\".** (Optional.) To get nice but \"experimental\" buttons for adding simple formatting to your messages, and for adding emojis with autocomplete after typing a colon \":\" and a keyword.\n\n    8. **Reduce the default notification level to \"Mentions only\".** This is ok for a team chat if you want to reduce notification frequency. You'll still see red bubbles with \"new messages\" counters in chats so you can catch up, but you will only get notifications (little desktop overlay window, sounds, e-mail message) for your @username mentions and for @all. To set this up, mouse over the \"Open Village MENA: Team\" room in the room list, click the \"\u2026\" on-hover button and choose \"Mentions only\".\n\n    9. **Mobile app: Shorten the \"sync request delay\" time.** In the Android mobile app, this is done under \"\u2630 \u2192 Settings \u2192 Delay between two sync requests\". The default value is 600 s. Set it to around 60 s instead. Otherwise, you would get all messages 10 minutes (!) after they are sent in cases when Matrix is not the Android foreground app. And that probably includes \"when the screen is locked or off\".\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Advanced topics</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Formatting your content</h3>\n\n**Formatting messages.** Matrix messages support basic Markdown syntax for formatting \u2013 see the [complete syntax reference](http://commonmark.org/help/). Some is also available from buttons after enabling the \"New Composer &amp; Autocomplete\" option in your account settings. Some is not, for example the code for proper hyperlinks: to create a link [like this](http://example.com/), you would write this text into your message: `[like this](http://example.com/)`.\n\n**Emojis.** With the \"New Composer &amp; Autocomplete\" option enabled in your account settings, you get emoji auto-complete after typing a colon \":\" and the start of an emoji's name. The complete list of named emojis is available in an [emoji cheat sheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) and the [emoji codes reference](https://emoji.codes/). (Images may look slightly different though, as Riot uses an EmojiOne emoji font in a different version, probably the last fully open source version [EmojiOne v2](https://www.emojione.com/emoji/v2), [here on Github](https://github.com/emojione/emojione/tree/2.2.7).)\n\n  &nbsp; It is even possible to include emojis into your display name \u2013 they will show up as little colorful images whenever your username is displayed. You configure this either by putting the equivalent Unicode character (like the one for \"ghost\") into the \"Settings \u2192 Display name\" field. Or by doing the same with a slash command and the emoji code in a message: `/nick someword :ghost:`. This also means that when mentioning your display name, the emoji has to be included for a mention notification to work! Not a problem when only appending the emoji to a normal text username, as people can use autocomplete for mentioning. And esp. not a problem when keeping the textual part of such a username the same as the localpart in @localpart:edgeryders.eu, as then the mention will also work when somebody omits the emoji, as it's still a valid Matrix ID, and mentions also work for these.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Posting pictures and files</h3>\n\n**Sharing images and other files.** It is possible to share any files to a chat room, using the \"Upload File\" button in the message editor. Uploaded images will be displayed inside the chat, other uploaded files will be offered for download. When the chat is end-to-end encrypted, the files will also be saved encrypted on our server, in which case nobody outside of the chatroom (not even the server admin) can access their content. Please delete the messages with large files (>1 MiB) after the other people in the chat downloaded them. It will help us keep the backup sizes small. Even better is to upload the files to a shared folder (like, Google Drive) and to only post the link to them in the chatroom.\n\n**Posting images from the clipboard.** It is possible to post images to a chatroom from the clipboard, which is faster for sharing images than to save an image from the browser to a file first. Tested with Chrome / Chromium 60. Instructions:\n\n1. In your browser, right-click on the image you want to share in the chatroom.\n2. Click \"Copy image\".\n3. Right-click in the Matrix chat message editor and select \"Paste\" (or just press Ctrl+V while the keyboard focus is on the chat message editor).\n4. A popup window will appear asking if you want to upload the image from your clipboard to share i in the chatroom. Confirm that.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. Getting people's attention</h3>\n\n**Getting people's attention.** We'll have to experiment to find best practices for a long-running team chat without constant notification spam. The current proposal is this one though: Assume everyone in the project team chat has notifications set to \"Mentions only\" for this room. They will probably catch up with all messages at some time, but you can't rely on that. So use mentions to get their attention \u2013 `username`, `Username`, `@username` and `@username:edgeryders.eu` all work and produce a red message on the receiver's side, and a notification (desktop notification, sound, e-mail after 10 minutes). **Please note**: when you try to mention someone who has not changed their default display name, autocomplete will not work, and you will have to type the whole `@username:edgeryders.eu`.\n\n&nbsp; When you really need the attention of everyone in the chat, in theory you can use `@all` to the same effect. This assumes everyone made the required keyword notifications setup as described above, which in practice will be a completely wrong assumption.\n\n**How e-mail notifications work.** After setting up your Matrix account as instructed above by connecting your e-mail address and enabling it as a notification target, you will receive e-mail notifications about Matrix messages you received while offline, or that you rceived but did not yet read in your browser / mobile app. Quite similar to how it works with Facebook messages. In more detail, the timers work like this for each Matrix \"room\" individually (however if any e-mail is sent, it will include all accumulated e-mails from all rooms!):\n\n1. A first e-mail is sent 10 minutes after you received the first message while offline, or after 10 minutes of not reacting to browser / phone notifications.\n\n2. A second e-mail is sent 10 minutes after the first if there are any new messages since the first one.\n\n3. No new e-mails are sent for the next 12 hours, after which this whole three-step timer process is started again.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. Creating and managing rooms and chats</h3>\n\n**Creating rooms**. It is advisable to always create rooms, even if you only want to chat with one person. For that, click <kbd>+</kbd> next to the section title \"Room\", click \"Create new room\" and in the settings screen that appears set \"Enable end-to-end encryption: off\". Unlike chats create in section \"People\", rooms allow to disable encryption, so you will not have to deal with cross-device key requests, key backup, inability to read old messages and so on. \n\n&nbsp; The difference of chats created in section \"People\" is that these chats treat every message as if it contained a mention, so the person you are chatting with will see the notification of every message you send. However, you can achieve the same in rooms by hovering over the room name in the element.io room list sidebar, clicking on the bell icon, and setting \"Notification options: All Messages\". That affects only notifications to you, so your chat partner would have to do the same on their side.\n\n**Inviting people to a room**. Once a room has been created, you will need to invite people to join it. Click on the room from the list on the left, then click the \"Invite to this room\" icon on the bottom right of the window. Invited people appear in a list on the right side of the window. **Please note**: when you try to invite someone who has not changed their default display name, autocomplete will not work, and you will have to type the whole address as `@username:edgeryders.eu`. \n\n**Customizing rooms**. Click the cog icon next to the room name to change the settings. We recommend to upload a nice avatar for it: you can do so by clicking the camera icon under the avatar (the default avatar is a circle with the first letter of the room's name). The camera icon is only visible after clicking on the cog (settings) icon. We also recommend you set a color for the room that is in line with the avatar. This way, people have a visual cue as to which room they are writing in.\n\n**Room administration actions.** As a room's administrator, you have the options to \"mute\", \"kick\" and \"ban\" users, also accessible with slash commands of the same name:\n\n* \"Mute\" means the user stays in the room and can read but not contribute any more.\n\n* \"Kick\" is forcing a user to leave the room, just as if they had chosen the \"leave\" action by themselves. Means, they can re-join at will (if it's a public room) or when invited.\n\n* \"Ban\" means a forced leave, and the user is prevented from re-joining until the admin uses an \"unban\" command.\n\n**Getting more help.** The \"official\" documentation of the Riot client to Matrix, which we use, is [here](https://about.riot.im/need-help/).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-5\">4.5. Voice calls, video calls, screensharing</h3>\n\nMatrix includes functions for voice and video calls. The one-on-one calls work pretty well, and you can just use them. But the conference calls feature is not mature at all and will not be finished, so [we use Zoom](/t/id/8872) and sometimes Google Hangouts for group / team calls etc..\n\n**Fixing \"Could not connect media\".** In case a one-on-one voice or video call does not work for you with an error message \"could not connect media\", try the following:\n\n1. **Simply try calling again.** Usually, this happens due to intermittent network failures, esp. network congestion, either in the local wifi networks or the WAN / Internet. Otherwise:\n\n2. **Don't use Firefox on Mac.** Currently (2020-01), voice calls are not possible with the Firefox browser on a Mac OS X operating system. If that's your case, switch to Chrome (or Chromium, Ungoogled Chromium or the like) for these calls.\n\n3. **Disable P2P connections.** Click the lower-left gear icon to go to the user settings screen, and there enable the option \"VOPI: Disable Peer-to-Peer for 1:1 calls\". Both parties of a call have to do this before the call. This should work around firewall issues that can prevent direct connections between computers on the Internet; such issues can happen when you are in a university network or other heavily managed / protected network. (However, this tip is experimental. Tell in the comments below if it helped.)\n\n**Screensharing.** Matrix / Riot supports screensharing in calls, but like voice and video calls it is only properly usable for one-on-one calls. It works with recent Firefox and Chrome versions like this:\n\n* If the screen-sharing user's browser is Chrome (or Chromium), he or she has to start it with a special command line option ([details](https://stackoverflow.com/q/26827401)). For example:\n`chromium-browser --enable-usermedia-screen-capturing`\n\n* In the Riot web application, press the \"Shift\" key and then click the videocall button.\n\n* Confirm you really want to share your screen. ([More on screensharing safety](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/screenshare-safety).)\n\nMore details about this process [here](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/3025#issuecomment-275418688). It works well when screen-sharing from Firefox or Chrome, and receiving in Chrome (should also work in Firefox, but it had issues at times).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-6\">4.6. Voice messaging</h3>\n\nWhen communicating over a low-bandwidth Internet connection with undependable quality, voice calls in Matrix / Riot or otherwise will not be of much use as it will be hard and often impossibe to understand each other. Here, sending voice messages back and forth in a Matrix chat is a nice solution.\n\nVoice messages are just audio files uploaded from the local computer. Those in formats MP3, OGG and WAV (and perhaps more) will then get an embedded player right in the Matrix chat. For the file format, we here go for Vorbis files (`.ogg`) at the lowest quality (`0`), which [means 64 kbps](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/OGG) and results in a file size of ca. 360 kB per minute when using one audio channel. That audio quality is good for voice messages, file size is as well compact.\n\nSo we only need an efficient workflow to record and upload these audio files, and we're good to go \u2013 see the instructions below.\n\n**Remaining issues.** In the setup as documented below, a few issues remain:\n\n* Navigation in the soundplayer embedded in Riot does not work. Probably a normal bug. You can download and open the file in another soundplayer to fix this.\n\n* For uploading voice messages or any other files >2 MiB, a configuration change to our Matrix server is needed.\n\n\n#### 1. Voice messaging under Linux\n\n**Installation and configuration:**\n\n1. Install audio-recorder ([instructions](https://askubuntu.com/a/298286)).\n\n2. Start audio-recorder with the command `audio-recorder`.\n\n3. In the \"Additional Settings \u2192 General\" screen, disable \"Window always on top\".\n\n4. In the \"Additional Settings \u2192 Recording Commands\" screen, create a OGG recording command with:\n\n    * Title: \"Voice message, lossy, 64 kbps\"\n    * File extension: ogg\n    * Command: `audio/x-raw,rate=44100,channels=1 ! vorbisenc name=enc quality=0.0 ! oggmux`\n\n5. Using the corresponding option in your window manager, send the window to a specific desktop to prevent it from showing up on all at once.\n\n6. Create a bookmark in your file opening dialogue for the directory where audio-recorder stores its recordings.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n1. Make a recording in audio-recorder by pressing start and stop. It is saved automatically.\n\n2. Click the \"file upload\" dialogue in Riot to upload the recorded file.\n\n3. Use your bookmark to navigate to the directory with the recordings and choose the newest one.\n\n**More documentation:**\n\n* For audio-recorder: open this URL in your browser (tested on Ubuntu 17.04): `file:///usr/share/audio-recorder/`.\n\n* For the options of GStreamer vorbisenc, [see here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-vorbisenc.html).\n\n* For the quality values of GStreamer vorbisenc: 0.0 - 1.0 correspond to 0 - 10 in the official Vorbis standard \u2013 [source](http://blaise.ca/blog/2008/05/02/encoding-to-ogg-vorbis-using-a-gstreamer-pipeline-vorbisenc-plugin-quality-property/).\n\n\n#### 2. Voice messaging under Windows\n\n**Installation and configuration:**\n\n1. Visit the Github project \"[Instruction Guide: fmedia under Windows](https://github.com/edgeryders/instruction_guide_fmedia_under_windows)\".\n\n2. Download the project as a `.zip` file, as shown here: \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ac18671a4c775964ca26835ba11a52142e1051c.PNG\" width=\"600\">\n\n3. To unpack, install and use the software, follow the installation and usage instructions in the project's [README](https://github.com/edgeryders/using-fmedia-recorder-under-windows#installation-and-usage-instruction-for-fmedia-voice-recorder-under-windows).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-7\">4.7. Sharing login credentials and other secrets</h3>\n\nThe advised and safest way to share login information of Edgeryders' accounts for external platforms (e.g. GMail, Twitter, Zoom) is to send it in Riot as follows:\n\n1. Make sure receiving party is on the Edgeryders Matrix server: mouse over their avatar to show the address and make sure the address ends in `:edgeryders.eu`.\n\n2. Start a personal one-on-one chat for this purpose.\n\n3. Enable encryption for this chat in the chatroom's settings.\n\n4. Send the login credentials or other secret information.\n\n5. Remove the message after the other party confirms they got it. You find that option in the **<kbd>`\u2026`</kbd>** menu of a message, which appears when mousing over it.\n\nIn fact this mechanism is much safer than sending a password by (unencrypted) e-mail: it is encrypted by HTTPS and by end-to-end encryption, stored in encrypted form, and is deleted after use from our server, with no copies ending up on other servers. (The latter is why this process should only be used for `@username:edgeryders.eu` Matrix IDs.)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-8\">4.8. Resetting your password</h3>\n\nDue to the way how our Matrix server is set up right now, your Matrix ID is independent of your e-mail address. You also cannot connect it to your e-mail address yourself \u2013 the corresponding feature under \"user menu \u2192 All Settings \u2192 E-Mail Adresses\" simply does not work.\n\nConsequentially, you cannot reset your own password. Ask @matthias to do so if you need it reset.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-9\">4.9. Other tips and tricks</h3>\n\n**Fixing online status issues.** If you see somebody posting while they are shown as \"offline\" in your Riot application's sidebar, it is usually because they are posting from a device you did not verify. Click on their user avatar icon, and verify the device they are currently using, or all devices. Do it either \"the right way\" (confirming in a voice call that the keys match), or just click \"verify\" if you don't care about encryption integrity in this chat.\n\n**Slash commands.** Similar to good old IRC, Matrix supports some commands. With the \"New Composer &amp; Autocomplete\" enabled in your account settings, type a slash \"/\" at the beginning of a message, and choose from the proposed commands. Most are useful for admins only. The [riot.im/app/](https://riot.im/app/) stable version provides 8 commands at this time, while the [riot.im/develop/](https://riot.im/develop/) development version has 19.\n\n**Using the Riot.im \"develop\" version.** While [riot.im/app/](https://riot.im/app/) provides the main / stable version of the Riot software, there is also a development version available at [riot.im/develop/](https://riot.im/develop/). It will share a login with the main / stable version, so you can use both in parallel without having to log in again.

Who gives it?</strong>\n\n\"The state is the main care provider\", say many Europeans. And sure, the welfare state is a major safety net in their societies. \"Business is the main care provider\", reply many Americans. They have a point too: their insurance companies, hospitals and clinic \u2013 most of these are businesses. \n\nAnd yet, that's not the whole story. Care models are failing: per capita health care expenditure grows faster than GDP. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well.  Under pressure to get care, the edges of society (the young, the nomads and migrants, the precariat) respond by getting creative. There are many ongoing experiments, large and very small.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A hackerspace in England provides a <a href=\"/access-space-a-new-model-for-individual-and-community-development\">safe space and a sense of identity to the members, many of whom are unemployed, or disabled, or homeless</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Hundreds of enterprising Greeks spawn a whole <a href=\"/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880\">network of \"shadow\" clinics</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Three expat adult couples in Belgium decide to<a href=\"/t/living-social-in-brussels-co-living-as-a-lifestyle-for-grown-ups/615\"> live under the same roof and be each other's support network</a>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAlong this journey, they (and we all) face deep questions about what care really is. Is it services? Is it human attention and warmth? Is it trying to fix what's wrong with people in need of care? Is it accepting everybody for what they are, with their strengths and weaknesses?\n\n<strong>On October 19-21 at #openvillage,</strong><strong> we</strong> <strong>bring these experiences and initiatives together into a demo of a new health and social care system.</strong> \n\n<strong>Do you have a story of care?

Participants varied from social clinics and solidarity pharmacies to time banks, social\n\nkitchens, traditional seed banks, eco-communities, cooperatives or social solidarity and exchange networks,\u00a0including initiatives like the worker's self-managed factory of Vio.Me, the Kinisi 136 water movement, the\u00a0Spithari eco-community project, the collective of Kafeneio Akadimias or Athens Time Bank, amongst others.\n\nThe Festival4sce differs from other similar events because it is entirely organized by grassroots initiatives. It\u00a0is based on horizontality, collective decision making, direct democracy processes, reciprocity, solidarity,\n\nparticipatory leadership and collective intelligence. There are no sponsors, no funding from organisations,\u00a0nor arbitrage.\n\nYear after year, the Festival4sce is a meeting point for exchanging knowledge and also offers visitors an\u00a0alternative and effective way out of the crisis. Discussions, presentations and workshops will debate round:\u00a0the commons, de-growth, exchange networks, alternative currencies, labour collectives, eco-communities,\u00a0waste management, resource allocation, sustainability and social participation.\n\nFor the first time, this year the Festival4sce is calling upon groups from around Europe in order to create\u00a0links between countries and initiatives, with the objective of transforming the festival into an event of\u00a0interest across Europe.\n\nThe Festival4sce promotes a world that fosters communication, mutual exchange and the transition to a\u00a0society based on participation and cooperation; which aims at self-management, solidarity, sustainability,\n\nself-sufficiency and at respecting man and nature alike.\n\nThe festival is a live proof of what passionate and committed people can do if they work together.\n\nDate: 2014-10-25 13:30:00 - 2014-10-25 13:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.\n\nURL: http://www.festival4sce.org/en/", "created_at": "2014-09-30 22:10:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.337705", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 381, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35818, "user_id": 3342, "topic_id": 6996, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Ok, after flushing, I have managed to lose one of the 'burnout' code but I still have some doubles.

Maybe they shouldn't. I also dislike fail2succede - this one I dislike more.\n\nBut brace, means that I have to put myself against something stronger and wait for impact, hoping for the best. Hoe does something like \"spring to failure\" sound to you? I don't have a better solution.\n\nfail2succeede is very bad because it makes me want to succeed. I think that the pdf should make people want to fail and learn about what failure is and how to work with it. Is it still true that we fear what we don't understand?\n\nMaybe succeede2fail ;)\n\nDestroy also works in this direction. I can destroy something without understanding it, and the point of the paragraph is to look more closely at the idea. But destroying it does not do that. Attacking it, does. Looking at it, poking it, do. I don't want to make everything sound happy and good. I like the edginess of fuckUp, I just think it can be better.\n\n3rd one is get rid of human error - is this what we want? - I think we should promote human error, look at it, understand it and record it. No?\n\nThe difference between the workshops \"DESTROY YOUR IDEA\" and \"PICK YOUR FAVORITE WAY TO FAIL\" is that in the first you get ideas on how to fail <strong>from the group</strong> and the second one <strong>you</strong> have to envision your own demise? They seam very similar to me. Probably I am missing something out.\n\nThere are a lot of things i like in the pdf, all the workshops I would go to and have a great time, fuckup and mess with people, I may be good at it. So, all the critics in this post are only to be discussed, not taken very seriously.\n\nhope it helps\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-21 21:50:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:57.481949", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 374, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62385, "user_id": 4604, "topic_id": 11070, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hi @MariaEuler - yes.

Depending on your preferred style of receiving information, you might prefer one to the other, but we'd recommend checking out both! \n\nContents: \n**1. What is ethnographic coding?**\n**2. Explanation of different approaches to coding by each ethnographer**\n**3. Strong Relations in the Graph**\n**4. Exploring the Graph: Expectations and Surprises**\n**5. Usefulness of the Graph** \n\n\n## What is ethnographic coding? \n\nEthnography is an interpretive practice aimed at understanding people's worldview from their own perspective. It aims, through in-depth engagement in the social worlds of participants, to detail collective modes of thought, imagination, and shared understandings. Ethnographers do this through \"deep hanging out\" in the spaces of those they study. \n\nFirst, some background on the ethnography team\u2019s (@amelia, @Bojan @hugi  @jakobskote @lalalua's) process: we read (and reread and reread) the stories posted on bbu.world. Then we develop codes (aka \"tags\") that we assign to sentences or paragraphs of the threads that interpret the content of the stories unfolding. Sometimes these codes are \u201cin-vivo\u201d reflections (direct quotes from the stories), sometimes they are words or phrases we come up with that are salient, summative, or essence-capturing. We keep these codes in an ever-evolving codebook, where we comment on each other's codes and constantly update them based on feedback and collaboration with the team. We also have bi-weekly calls in which we discuss the codes and stories in more detail. \n\n![image|690x400](upload://9ESzoh3HVPCoiZBxqEvsLmttrDq.png) \n\nAs @jakobskote puts it: The ethnography plays many roles within this project. One of them is to explore if the ethnography can be an aid to the collaborative process among the writers. In this sense the ethnographers become a part of their creative process, by providing a constant reflection of the collaboration. The texts are the only representations of the collaboration that we have access to. By treating these texts as a subject of ethnography in itself, the ethnography focuses solely on the results of the collaboration, and does not take into account outside influences and the writers\u2019 individual personas. The texts are in this way treated as a representation of the writers\u2019 collective consciousness, in its own right.\n\nAnd as @lalalua reminds us: Coding itself is a long process based on constant revision of assigned codes (changing the names of the codes and text it relates to). The graph of codes actually shows only the final selection and connection of codes but not the history of the coding process itself and different interesting negotiations happening throughout that task (the first iteration of which lasted over a month). \n\n![61341f4859ed0fd77008f4c0dc41b1d5bee543a5|614x690](upload://dRTZ7U3zyn4ny1o1k1Dsn2L64Xb.jpeg) \n\nYou can see the codebook in an organised, searchable form at https://codes.bbu.world/. If you're ever wondering about the definition of any of the codes, this is where to go! \n\n![image|690x550](upload://bgGkzka22HL0SBzKgH0MiWvUuZo.png)  \n\nOur codes are then automatically displayed in what we call a \"semantic social network\", which is basically a graph visualisation of the codes based on how often they co-occur (so, how frequently two concepts appear together in the same post). The idea is that the graph both shows you what people are talking about (concepts) and who they are talking to (which writers are writing with each other about those concepts). Some of these codes are concrete things, like \"plants\", whereas others are more abstract concepts, like \"lack of self-love\" (amusingly, these co-occur in some of your stories). You'll see many pictures of the network graph in this post! \n\n![image|324x212](upload://eVv9c7F6Vm7QMxUM30ulRO2QqJ.png)  \n\nYou can also see the codes that have co-occurred with a specific code, if you're interested in exploring what concepts have been most frequently connected to one concept in general (e.g. \"death\"):\n\n![image|690x508](upload://g48pNzaGvY9Lc7aXC7U8SWTfNkL.png)  \n\nIf you want a more detailed guide to ethnography, ethnographic coding, and semantic social network analysis, feel free to check out [this primer/course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CgXMzoygD_NZY_DM1bmaJJAb7i8wPL4Br5Ouz6EUbGw/edit?usp=sharing) @amelia made for beginners. \n\n## Different coding processes \n\nEthnography is an interpretive process, and requires reflexivity. Everyone views the world from a certain place. We want to each explain how we initally approach the coding process. \n\n@Bojan takes what he calls a \"psychogeographical\" approach:  \n\n> I\u2019m interested in a \u201ctaxonomic\u201d approach to coding. I\u2019m trying to imagine the BBU world created through texts as a conceptual whole even though most of the threads are narratively not connected. In this approach, I\u2019m more interested in the peripheral view \u2013 in things, and frames created for the sake of the individual narratives. When I code, I ignore the narrative and try to map (and count) different aspects of the created world: body, mind and space related issues, places and different beings living there, home hardware, profession of the character, emotions and feelings (produced along the narrative way), properties such as colors of furniture or clothing mentioned in texts.\n> \n> My first coding attempts were inspired by artistic practices such as psychogeography (focused on connection between emotions and build environment) and it could be compared to the process of mapping. From that perspective, text is perceived as territory inhabited with meaning. Most of my codes are then like boxes or containers, categories for the catalogue of the materiality of the created world. But it shouldn\u2019t be a rigid catalogue \u2013 it could, for example, show the exploded view of the \u201canatomy\u201d of the collective body created through the process of writing (with both \u2013 human, and non-human body parts).\n> \n> I see this approach as a tactic for tackling the pandemic context of first iteration in somehow indirect (and almost absurd or at least surreal) manner. *How is this time of new common normalities reflected into details of common fiction? Is there a relationship between official, restrictive approaches to the hygiene procedures and individual notions of (un)cleanliness and perception of our bodies? How do we perceive our physicality \u2013 which parts of the body become more significant; is it by chance that hands are mentioned so many times in different threads and that I\u2019ve managed to count around 50 different body parts mentioned in different threads (sometimes in the spotlight, sometimes hidden and marginal)?* The lockdown has affected all of the project participants, writers, hosts, ethnographers \u2013 our everyday working spaces have overlapped with our living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens (even more than before). Windows and doors highlighted the physical borderline between threatening outside and sheltered insides and became oft-mentioned parts of building infrastructure. In many cases narratives were placed in familiar but transformed spaces of characters' bedrooms, hallways and living rooms. \n\n@lalalua (Lea) takes a more topical approach, lead by some of the central themes she noticed in the stories:  \n\n> My coding process is based on several key topics I encountered in reading all of the Babel posts. I detected three topics that I further develop through interrelation between other added codes. These topics are: *pandemic*, *the non-human* and *relationships*. These topics (simultaneously they also function as central codes) are spatially choreographed and  correlations with other codes are explored. In that way I map out how these topics are interpreted by the writers but also how I inscribe new potential meanings into them. \n> \n> As my approach was topic-based I can see connections which have a logical link to some very present topics. This is visible in the example of connection between *pandemic*, *escape* and *sanitize* or *death* and *darkness*.\n\n@jakobskote takes a keener interest in how writers are expressing and constructing their worlds, specifically looking at all the different objects that the writers use to build up their narratives:\n\n> In my process of coding I am looking for what specific elements the writers use to construct their texts. These might be corporeal objects like \u201ccat\u201d or \u201corchid\u201d, incorporeal objects like \u201crecurring dream\u201d or \u201cclimate change\u201d, actions like \u201cderision\u201d or \u201cexcitement\u201d, states of being like \u201cstagnation\u201d or \u201cbeing a plant\u201d, and lastly meta elements like \u201cmilitary jargon\u201d or \u201cchange of narrator\u201d. I apply a democratic view on these objects and does not premier one before the other, which result in many codes per post (ca 25/post), and a slow process.\n\n@hugi and @amelia come from different interpretive backgrounds, but approach coding similarly -- wide open, trying to jump into the stream of the text and code from there. As a result, we often find ourselves in the deep end making links like a nutty, obsessive crime scene wall :smile: \n\n![5ddc5479e8e35198dcf4fd0a0512e115d5651116|690x517](upload://doksuzUpLkgNNDyJUlxfrcWLvfg.jpeg)  \n\nFrom here on out we will speak in a collective voice, which emerges from the merging of some of our interpretations of the coding process, the semantic social network graph, and the interpretive practice of using both tools to navigate the stories. \n\n## Strong relations in the graph\n\nThere is a very strong correlation cluster around \u201cpandemic\u201d that also came out very prominently when reading the fiction. Anything else at this point in time would be surprising. There are strong connections from pandemic to terms like \u201cconfinement\u201d, \u201cisolation\u201d and \u201csanitize\u201d. That this theme has featured so prominently makes the body of text really interesting from the perspective of mirroring this period in human history \u2013 the year when we found ourselves globally connected in real-time over a single common challenge. Confinement is connected to \u201cmeasure of time\u201d, a code used for explicit mentions of time passing. This is also unsurprising for anyone who has lived through the last few months. Confinement is also strongly related to \u201cfood\u201d. These connections are very obvious to us now, but if seen by someone waking up from a year-long coma, they might need some explaining. This is a good reminder of how things that are \u201cobvious\u201d are still interesting.\n\n![f07adf4ac07bddf0e6a72c06f9e8722e31589365|690x306](upload://yjnQpVN7mWlzE4ZHT4JLrETSVPD.jpeg)  \n\nAnother concept that feels apt for this period is \u201cdeath\u201d which is a very centrally connected node. Its strongest correlations are to \u201cdarkness\u201d, \u201caccepting death\u201d and \u201cdualism\u201d and more surprisingly to \u201cnon-human companions\u201d and \u201cpop-culture reference\u201d. Death is also strongly correlated to \u201cisolation\u201d, which seems to indicate that there is a connection between the narrative focus around the pandemic and the exploration of our relationship to death.\n\nThat death is connected to concepts like \u201cpop-music\u201d and \u201cpop-culture reference\u201d can be understood by exploring that connection. This strong connection comes from two threads, \u201cHe Was A Fire Sign\u201d and \u201cA Mind Adrift on the Ocean\u201d, and the strength of the connection is because many of the contributions used these themes together.\n\nThere are also codes that are unsurprisingly connected that do not carry much meaning. That hair is connected to the head is not exactly the most exciting discovery of the year.\n\nAround \u201cmythology\u201d there is a cluster of codes that carry a lot of meaning but that are largely unsurprising. Mythology is correlated to mythological actors like \u201ckaggen\u201d, to mythical tropes like \u201cfirstborn child\u201d, \u201cforeseeing the future\u201d, \u201cancient artifact\u201d, \u201cdevil\u201d and \u201cdestiny\u201d. There is also a strong connection to the idea of \u201creimagining myths\u201d which is largely unsurprising in the context of myths in collaborative fiction.\n\n\n![image|668x500](upload://VAoKZABuQz16r3TomB5hJmd7Kk.png)  \n\nMythology is in turn connected to \u201cgod\u201d, which in this context means \u201cthe almighty God\u201d, rather than a god in a pantheon. This connection is also largely unsurprising. God connects to more \u201cdualist\u201d concepts like light and darkness, and to death.\n\nAnother cluster of strong connections forms around the concept of \u201cmother\u201d, and most terms that correlate strongly are either neutral (like \u201cbody position\u201d, \u201cwindow\u201d and \u201cmeasure of time\u201d), indicative of a problematic relationship (\u201clying\u201d, \u201cmadness\u201d, \u201cpanic\u201d or \u201ccruelty\u201d) or indicative of a character going through an inner process (\u201cself-reflection\u201d). There is a noticeable absence of strongly correlating terms around safety, kindness, and care around the concept of mother. Many of the strangest negative connections come from a single thread (\u201cWhere is Quarantine\u201d), where the mother figure is demonized. In another thread, \u201cA Mind Adrift on the Ocean\u201d, the mother figure is not described in a negative light, but the memories of the mother are brought up during a difficult experience. In this case, a limitation of SSNA is revealed \u2013 that it\u2019s not possible to conclude any connection between concepts, just that they have appeared together. This is important for the writers to understand as they explore the graph.\n\nFrom the character network, we can see that there is a bit of spill-over of characters and concepts happening between certain narratives. At this point in the ethnography, The character network is possibly more able to unearth some common themes that appear because of the strong correlation of certain characters with shared concepts.\n\n\n![76ec56a82d89c18f35b76ce9ee73c67c5f2c134c|690x385](upload://gY2H3maTzD9EBrf8Hp3WoxXIKPa.jpeg)  \n\n\nThis picture shows some emerging themes, but there are also themes are missing in the graph but very present in the narrative. For example, the reimagined mythology texts have a prevalent theme of relationships, intimacy, and sex that does not show up in the graph. Similarly, the context of many confinement stories is dealing with interpersonal relationship dynamics that don\u2019t show up in the graph at this correlation level.\n\n## Exploring the Graph: Expectations and Surpises\n\n**Easily Understood Connections**\n\nThere are a lot of connections around pandemic and quarantine related concepts that are not very surprising. In our ethnographic process we have started with the longer, more popular, threads, out of the assumption that these might better reflect the shared consciousness of the writers. This is certainly true in one respect, but it\u2019s a problematic assumption because of the fact that these threads have in many cases a comparatively lower threshold of entry. One example is the diary-style threads that follow no stringent framing or narrative, which allows the collaborating writers vastly more entry points than for example a very narrative-driven crime drama. The diary style threads tend to touch on the topics of pandemic and quarantine, which comes of no surprise given the ongoing pandemic. Given the length and the popularity of these threads, the concepts related to pandemic and quarantine are then coded more often than less numerous topics, giving them their prevalence within the network.\n\n**Surprising Connections**\n\nWe are still in the early stages of the project and the analysis, so there is yet much more data to be gathered to find the really juicy stuff. One thing Jakob in particular is trying to see is how, and if, various topics, writing styles, and ways of framing a story, lends itself to different kinds of collaboration. He has yet not gotten enough data to get any proper answers to this question. There are also plenty of occurrences of non-standard ways of writing throughout the texts, for example stage directions, visual concrete poetry, and writing with a scientific language. It will be interesting to see how these codes correlate with other topics down the line.\n\nWhat has been surprising is the many occurrences of characters wanting to be, being or turning into nature and plants, and other subjects within the wide sphere of queer ecologies and non-dualist views of nature. This could be related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has highlighted our human world\u2019s saturation with non-human agents, and forcing us to rethink our delineation of the human. Jakob is currently researching these topics in other contexts, so he feels he is naturally biased in looking for them here as well.\n\n> Rather than saying that the forest is the trees or the network between it, it is more true to say that the conversations really are the forest.\n\n> I watch a whale falling towards me, a shadow-body. I watch it as it comes closer and closer to me. I long for the big carcass to cover me with its pressure, months pass, years like this. I become a part of the ocean floor, seaweed covers me while I wait.\n\n![a577feedc2645d1bea62264bb186f4bc1e33bd3c|555x500](upload://nBNS5MJnGNQtS0UTLNqCq8h5deY.jpeg) \n\nAn interesting aspect of these explorations of queer ecology is that they do not fall in the pastoral traps that sometimes surround this subject. Instead, they explore the inherent violence and darkness of an interconnected nature, where both parasitism and eating others are a necessity for survival. This, we also assume, does probably stem from the fact that we are all painfully aware of the possibility of our bodies being turned into hosts for a hostile, and potentially lethal virus.\n\n> There goes Narcissus\u2014heart perfectly broken, jaw and eyes still just ordinary. We tell him:\n>\n>\n>\n> spend the night, there is no shame in being wrong,\n>\n>\n>\n> sink into our murky floor\u2014young bright things shouldn\u2019t drift and drain their own blood. Spend the night.\n>\n>\n>\n> His surrender is a quiet one.\n\n> They have their own symbiotes; there is a forgotten ecosystem of parasites, which march through bodies like a macabre parade, each consuming the offal of the other.\n>\n>\n>\n> The host, naturally, remains alive until the very end of this process.\n\n![image|690x449](upload://1Fu2D6EhEw8MChu8Jj26HNHTfO5.png)  \n\nThere is an inverse exploration of the same topic centering around various instances of bodily transformation/mutation and abjections, which inherently disturbs conventional conceptions of identity. Again, we assume these explorations stem from the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced us into a collective reconsideration of the solidity of the concept of the human. These bodily transformations/mutations most often seem to revolve around the skin, the physical border of our flesh against the outer, non-human world, which points at an exploration of the permeability of identity.\n\n\n> He scratched his upper right arm were the skin had peeled away to reveal the crystalline structure beneath.\n\n![884e755af34c0b0accfa75d46146d2749b987bcc|690x340](upload://jrP20qlzxb21eYDekmUZbzXADfu.jpeg) \n![ba74ffde2885aaa75a7d257cbbae4fa610454ba4|690x458](upload://qBttK7JAx19P1WH3Dzj73lKBuAs.png) \n\n\nThere is also an interesting connection between bodily transformations/mutations and hair. Our speculation is that this is due to hair being a peculiar object, being both a body part and a fashion statement. A physical part of our body, who\u2019s growth we cannot control, while at the same time being an individual, and infinitely customizable, signifier of identity. The fact that our internal bodies can be affected by non-human actors isn\u2019t as abjective as it is not visible, the real fear lies in a virus that affects how we present ourselves to the world. The coronavirus does not affect our appearance apart from requiring us to wear facemasks, but the situation triggers cultural memories of earlier, more visually disturbing, diseases.\n\n> A haircut that does not flatter and that cannot be mended is a helpless feeling. There was nothing to be done. Hands were tied. No amount of blow-drying or gelling could help now. The shape was here to stay, at least for six weeks. Six excruciating weeks.\n\nApart from stemming from the ongoing pandemic, we believe these topics are a part of an ongoing cultural questioning of the human/nature divide. This, one could argue, is a collective cultural processing of the much bigger ongoing catastrophe, the climate breakdown. When looking at the code \u201cclimate change\u201d in the graph, the code it most often co-occurs with is \u201cdevour\u201d (however, it has only been applied once, so this finding does not indicate a strong connection.)\n\n![7c0c0ea3fd889abf5eed24f4771b3a8cb46151c4|648x499](upload://hHn2oWbaRBDxfFNPqSvkjm8MO44.png)  \n\n\nTracing body connections in the graph also shows, for example, that \"uncleanness\" and \"cleanliness\" are connected with \"eyes\", but (from some reason) only uncleanness is connected with \"mouths\". Cleanliness is associated with more passive body positions such as sitting and with bed, and uncleanness is associated with door and threat on the one side, and with making decisions and helping others on the other side. Maybe we could say that it\u2019s predictable to associate domain of clean with the safety zone of bedroom, and domain of dirt with the threat that comes from the outer side of doors, but it is interesting that uncleanness comes together with more active notions (decisions making and helping). Maybe there is an implicit connection between will needed to open the doors, and way of handling the risk in the act of helping the others.      \n\n## What do we think the graph is useful for in the context of the BBU project? How does it help us explore the stories?\n\nThe purpose of the graph in the context of the writers is to act as a map over the landscape of the texts, and in this sense a map over their collective consciousness. It is also not a map in the sense that it does not claim to offer an objective, zoomed-out view --- instead, it is an interpretation, based on woven-together, iterative, collaborative ethnographic work. We can think about it as an evolving conversation that also acts as a navigation tool. \n\nIn a basic way the graph is a non-dimensional representation of all the narratives, in the sense that the concepts, displayed in a network, don\u2019t follow a predefined progression. Text is, in most cases, inherently 1-dimensional in the way it is experienced, you read a text from left to right and does most often not depart from this linearity. The content proliferates in a multitude of directions as soon as it has entered our mind, but the way in there is a one-lane, one-way bottleneck.\n\nA story told through a graph turns this on its head. While losing the intimacy of the text, it instead allows the reader to get an overview of the narrative that is not visible from within the text itself. As Open Ethnographer shows connections between codes applied to the same post, some unwanted connections will occur (for example a flower appearing in the beginning of a post being connected to an act of cruelty happening at the end of it.)\n\nThe graph does neither distinguish between different narratives, instead it regards all narratives as expressions of the same collaborative process. Themes that occur among one group of writers can appear among a different group of writers, and then be represented as the same theme in the graph. This allows us to look at the themes specifically, and not who is writing about them, which gives a clearer view of the collective consciousness, that is not clouded by the presence of individual writers.\n\nWhen looking at the strongest correlations in the graph, it can be reaffirming that there are in-fact some \u201chigh level\u201d overlapping themes. This can help us orient ourselves in the shared imagination and understand where it overlaps and where it doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhen looking also at the weaker correlations, the graph can be suggestive for themes to weave into future narratives. In a solitary creative process, we build internal worlds and maps of what we are exploring. As connections emerge in our creativity we can notice them and reinforce or deconstruct those connections. When filtering the graph to include a weak connection that could emerge if reinforced, it may be possible for us to immerse ourselves in a shared subconscious imagination.\n\nFinally, the graph also tells us which concepts we have explored together with others. That can also help us understand who we are not working with, and which concepts we are not engaging with, allowing us to either reinforce or question those patterns.\n\nWe can use the analogy of a natural landscape. Reading a story is taking a hike through the landscape, while looking at the graph is looking at the map of the landscape. By only looking at the map you can never gain the depth, intensity and intimacy of experience that you get from the hike. On the other hand, if you go for the hike without the map you will end up easily getting lost or only walking the most beaten and obvious path. The map will help you find parts of the landscape which you have not yet explored, and didn\u2019t know existed.\n\nThe graph enables us to see the links between certain concepts that are not necessarily noticed while reading specific stories. In that way it opens new interpretations of some charters/concepts or it opens space for completely new stories that can be written in part based on these links. It highlights different otherwise invisible textures that could come to life in upcoming writing iterations.\n\nHopefully, the graph can play a similar role for the writers, by allowing them to get an overview over the totality of the content on the Babel platform, and positioning themselves within it, to see what white spots occur, what parts of the collective consciousness they have not yet traversed.", "created_at": "2020-05-26 13:09:31.707381", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 13:51:30.690880", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4211, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 117.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35836, "user_id": 2086, "topic_id": 6993, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Sounds interesting...if you like I can link you with our team in Tunisia.

Open to comments._ \n\nPOPREBEL is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 framework program for research (grant number 822682). Its community, which we warmly denominate &lsquo;Wellbeing in Europe&rsquo;, is the community we are building in symbiosis with the research project. It is a collective effort to understand the ways in which citizens in various European countries live, work, and participate in society during times of populism on the rise. It is a platform to share stories, ideas and insights, make new connections, coordinate the work. It is a diverse group of people of all ages, genders, income levels, political ideologies etc., mainly in Central and Eastern Europe but not limited to it. It is a process that brings people together, virtually or physically, to share, inspire, connect and collaborate effectively. Out of this will emerge new ideas, new solutions and new connections that benefit all.\n\nTo any and all participants:\n\n1. We have designed Wellbeing in Europe with you, the community, in mind, to work as a knowledge engine. The more you contribute, the better everyone&rsquo;s understanding will be, and the more our collective understanding and ability to take action will grow.\n2. Wellbeing for Europe welcomes participation by anyone who wishes to engage in a serious discussion about life, work and participation in society in the context of different political changes, no matter their political values and orientations. We support a constructive discussion with those on different sides of the spectrum, rather than a motivated dismissal, of the populist arguments.\n3. To ensure constructive, respectful discussions, the team is trained in providing tight community management services and steering the debate in such a way that no abuse is tolerated, and that arguments stay level-headed and facts-backed.\n4. POPREBEL, the research project you are helping by your participation in the community, is designed to work as a catalyst. It will run until the end of 2021, though its materials will remain available long after that, and the community on this platform as well.\n5. The project team is committed to listening and engaging in an exchange with you, and provide you with access to the common resources on this platform, connect you with new information, knowledge, people, and opportunities. Specifically, what you stand to gain by participating: be guided to contribute as per their interests, be given constructive feedback or advice, be offered a financial reward for a high quality contribution, be recruited for a paid position, be offered learning and personal development opportunities i.e. trainings, receive invitations to project events, access other opportunities available in the community, either provided by the project partners or by other community members or organisations\n6. The project team will formally acknowledge most active contributors by recruiting them for roles compensated financially: storytellers, experts and or curators in events. We think of active contributors as those whose contributions are acknowledged and validated by other members of the community, as per the number of comments and reactions to their contributions, and their level of centrality in the network graph (example). This process is governed by the formal activities, resources and capacity available in the project. All opportunities for recruitment will be advertised in the community forum as open calls.\n7. We wish to help one another to improve our ability to analyze and interpret information. We analyse and structure the information shared in our conversations to support community members' desire and ability to constructively engage in society through facts, statistics and other pieces of information. In a world of ubiquitous digital connectivity, improving access and use of information helps us navigate meaningfully current ecosystems and societies. Whether it is because you want to solve local problems, keep governments accountable, avoid expensive mistakes or learn new things about the world in which you live, knowledge is power.\n8. We cannot promise you it will solve any of the issues raised by contemporary European populists. It is meant for all of us, whether we resonate with the populist arguments or not, to raise awareness, share with one another information and experiences about how we, as a community, cope with those issues.\n9. Keep in mind that we are a diverse community. This is critical: almost anything we can achieve rests on that diversity. It is essential that we stay wide open to an influx of new people, insights and skills. This means we accept and take into account that individuals should be able to choose their own degree and style of participation, as long as it does not limit the autonomy of others.\n10. Who does the work, calls the shots. The focus of any interaction should be to empower and encourage each one of us to do things, instead of sitting on the sidelines and telling others not to do things. If you want to make something better, you can add thoughtful suggestions. The suggestions most likely to be implemented are ones which are backed with an offer of hands-on help from the persons making them.\n11. You are free to use materials from the discussion to draw your own conclusions about the issues we discuss. You are free to report those conclusions anywhere, on the web and in real life, subject only to the law and the terms of the license, as long as you attribute those materials to their authors.

This conversation is hosted by Edgeryders, in partnership with University College London, University Karlova (the Czech Republic), University Jagiellonski (Poland), University of Belgrade (Serbia).

We commit to making every effort to maintain its space open for everyone of you to join us and use, or ethically misuse (for example by introducing topics that we did not think connect to the project, but you want to discuss with the community), so that the conversation space we maintain can evolve with the community itself. We are aware we cannot do it alone, and we try to facilitate your participation.\n14. We may enforce temporary restrictions to your access to the POPREBEL space, under those circumstances in which your behavior represents a risk for others (e.g.: violent or otherwise threatening behaviors).\n15.

It's been enriching at so many levels. I'd like to add to our stories so far some heartfelt testimonials from outside of the community:\n\n* read in the NY Times: The owner of this restaurant in NYC abruptly closed their business during a week of swirling news, supplier invoices, calls and cancellations, and heartfelt proofs of solidarity. \n*I have to hope that we matter in some other alternative economy; that we are still a thread in the fabric that might unravel if you yanked us from the weave [...] I, like hundreds of other chefs across the city and thousands around the country, are now staring down the question of what our restaurants, our careers, our lives, might look like if we can even get them back. I don\u2019t know whom to follow or what to think. Everyone says: \u201cYou should do to-go! You should sell gift cards! You should offer delivery! You need a social media presence! You should pivot to groceries! You should raise your prices [...] If this kind of place is not relevant to society, then it \u2014 we \u2014 should become extinct.* ([source)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html?fbclid=IwAR0ML2v8itQ3HAttOTefugjOzPO8TdkxWvAE6u6eZeqRwtQjvVd_wwcWnoE)\n\n* read on reddit:\n*I\u2019m a housekeeper in Maine. I found out Thursday that I am being laid off indefinitely. Thursday I had a job, Friday I didn\u2019t. In one week, I lost both of my jobs (I worked at my University, and a hotel), had to move out of my apartment (can\u2019t pay my $800 rent, landlord not helping), and had to switch to online learning as a MUSIC major (no way in hell will that work).*\n*It\u2019s 4:58 in the morning. I woke up from a nightmare, and woke up in a nightmare.*\n*EDIT because a couple people decided they should attempt to \u201csave me\u201d from a music major... I\u2019m a music education major. Please mind your business, I\u2019m not looking for career advice. \ud83d\ude2a* \n--\n*As a business owner myself, I feel like it\u2019s worth mentioning that even the most well-intentioned and seemingly well-prepared of us who want to do all those things may not necessarily be able to. We kept money in the bank that would keep us safe for around a 12-14 months if we had a sustained and unforeseen 20-30% drop in demand (maybe a drastic reshuffling of Google rankings or something) and needed some time to adjust. However, at least for us, we had 90% of our business disappear overnight due to this.* ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/flgaml/people_who_lost_their_job_due_to_this_crisis_what/fl07i4f/))\n\n* from close friends: *I am lucky to keep my job, we are working remotely in the [IT] company and we keep having the daily Scrum meetings and reports from across the teams. My heart jumped when one of the senior leads initiated on Slack a tiny bit of conversation that was more personal, about how we are actually doing and if we feel productive enough in this new rhythm. I realise there are things we never talk about with the teams because it's always delivery, delivery, delivery, but a personal check in, even a drop in the ocean, felt really human. Maybe it's these days when everyone is more sensible and if you're living alone like me, every bit matters. It's not exactly loss of work, but it's a loss that is very connected to our working lives*\n\n# Advice about productivity\n\n*I'm even getting to the point that I feel that I'm neglecting my dog because I am not finding new things for him to do now that I am around 24/7.* (comment [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/style/productivity-coronavirus.html#commentsContainer))\n\nThere is a plethora or articles dealing with self-management, self-optimisation and how we are prisoners of the always-on work culture. Here is a piece of compelling advice:\n\n *Typically, you work for the promise of something better \u2014 a promotion, a raise, a future that\u2019s more promising than the present. But with all of that in terrifying jeopardy, the demands are much lower. It is just enough to get by, if that\u2019s all you\u2019re capable of, since \u201cgetting by\u201d may be the new emotional normal for months to come. (If you\u2019re one of the superhumans responding to contemporary conditions by suddenly maximizing your productivity and turning into Jon Taffer on steroids, good for you, but please leave the rest of us alone.) The knowledge that you have no control over your own fate is a shitty feeling, one that is more acute than usual, and you\u2019d be forgiven if you took the space to process it all, however that processing might manifest itself.* ([source](https://theoutline.com/post/8883/working-from-home-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-not-a-recipe-for-productivity))\n\n\n# Where are you nowadays?\n\n* Does one of the stories reasonate with your own?

I think we should feature all conversations and proposals at some point, and later the tracks etc; but i might certainly miss something or important developments, I'm not following entirely all the conversations here :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-10 20:58:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.200964", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 222, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24897], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17278, "user_id": 3374, "topic_id": 691, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Communities are tricky. Internet definitely complicates things.</b>\n\nHello, @Alberto ! I think I may have not been clear in that while my school takes classes through the online platform we do live together during the school year. Though you do raise an interesting point of how to facilitate a similar sense of community through online communities. Have been a memeber of a few I think a big mistake a lot of groups try and do is replicate in person activites, like a bunch of people just hanging out through webcam. And to me that will always fall short of the live in person dynamic. I think one answer is to organizng physical met ups based off of promitiy of people, which works to an extent.\n\nBut for me the best online communities I've been in have used the fact the memebers are so spread out to there advantage. I think a good example of this is Under 30 Changemakers, which hosts discussions\u00a0and training through google hangouts. Instead of having broad web-chats they pre-choose discussion topics based off of community interests or world events and invite their memebers to bring in their perspective. That way people come in already invested in the topic and feel more connected to the community by interacting with members who share their passions. \u00a0Also, another activity that seems to go well it when people sign up to be matched with another random member for a skype session. The excitment of not knowing who you'll met but that you have this one community incommon is pretty enaging.\u00a0\n\nHope this helps!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-28 21:26:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.413283", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 278, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14631], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35834, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 6892, "post_number": 22, "raw": "@Sohayeb here is the project  I told you about what do you think is it feasible in our Tunisian context ?", "created_at": "2017-09-08 19:36:19.266421", "updated_at": "2017-09-08 19:36:40.293628", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 34, "score": 111.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71215, "user_id": 2536, "topic_id": 12699, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Thank you Noemi for the note taking.  \n\n## the manifesto \n\na document that is agreed by present inhabitants and accepted by new inhabitants. it could also be the beginning of a governance doc for the inhabitants.

Politycy graj\u0105 na naszych emocjach i wykorzystuj\u0105 je do swoich cel\u00f3w, a my si\u0119 temu poddajemy. Brak w tym merytoryki.

We want to rethink a home that is collective, a communal living. The Reef project is open and the idea is to build a strong community to make it real.**_\n\n**_The idea of the Reef is to try a mixt model of green communal living and coworking in Brussels. The Reef is a project for the community, for the kids and everyone active at shaping the future._**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/370011825?byline=0\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n# Workshop programme: \n\n3 rules of engagement : Deep Listening ~ Take Space when you need it ~ Don't judge what others are saying\n\n**1.Speed Dating**\n--\n\nIn small groups, participants took 2 minutes to share his / her experiences regarding the following questions. After 15 minutes, we gathered and shared what we learned about the other person.\n\nTable 1. How I do what I do\n\nTable 2. How I interact with others in Brussels\n\nTable 3. How I see my future\n\n**2. Focus Group**\n--\n\nParticipants were gathered into 1 group and openly discussed about the following questions\n\n**Do you think Brussels needs more community, more communal living models ?**\n\nWhat does living in community really means ? This is a concept relating to sharing a space and put in practise the community agreement build by the community.\n\nValues, means of communication and resources can be shared within the community.\nYet, members need tools for conflict resolution. The community also requires time,money, intellectual and physical energy to function.\n\n**For those of you already living communally, how did you create the group ?**\n\nThe capacity of personal investment in the community is a relevant indicator. This indicator can be balanced with the overall project the community is building regarding social inclusion or cultural development for example.\n\n**Do you think you find the right match ?**\n\nExperience proves it might be better to start with a few people, not necessarily life lasting friend. Experience also proves that a few, deep implicit rules might be more powerful than setting a list of rigid explicit rules at the beginning. The main priority is to develop a clear idea of how we want to live and then starts something. At the beginning even 7 - 9 people is already enough to start.\n\n**Would you be ready to rent, to buy, to negotiate a lower price than the market ?**\n\nCo-owning a place requires so much trust, you have to have done so much in your community agreement before putting money out.\n\nA more flexible option could be to rent the space to the community and get spaces of freedom to move in and move out when necessary. For example, in such a model like a trust.\nThis structure could be another way of creating assets without taking too much risks.\nIn the trust model, a community buy a place, but the individuals rents it. People have flexibility to move in and move out. Especially when you have kids, you need a solid warranty on your investment. A trust would act as a neutral third part collecting investments.\n\n**3. World Caf\u00e9**\n--\nParticipants were divided into 3 smaller tables. Each table focused on one main area of the Reef community building.\n\n**The House: how does the space look like? How much common space, how much individual space? How many kitchens/ bathrooms? Green space? Where is it located? Who is it open to? Can people visit?**\n----\n\nThe space could be divided between common spaces and individual spaces. Individual spaces could be flexible depending everyone&rsquo;s needs. Some space could served as a guest house.\nThe space could include a logistical area and a handraft area. It could also have an open coworking space during the day, with a caf\u00e9 inside. This coworking space will bring a connection between the ecosystem and the outside world.\nThis place could also have agricultural production. With a land or even a terrace one can create a planet. Agroecology is an important topic. Building a place where we can grow food, have some animals, do aquaponics could be perfect.\n\n**The Activities: collective habits, economic organisation, activities for neighborhood. Which tools, methods, practices can we build to create a solid and engaged community?**\n----\n\nInternal activities could be separated from external activities.\nCooking, eating are basic communal activities. Create a collective garden, do recup of unsold goods are also ideas. Cleaning and laundry are collective habits to discuss.\nA connection can be created between inside activities and outside activities. For example if there is dancers in the house, then part of the outside activities could be nourished by living arts activities. There is also the idea of mixed used activities during day and night.\nIn Berlin, there is this co-housing space called [Happy Pigeons.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/happy-pigeons-co-living-in-berlin/10859/) At night part of the house become an open place (for workshops, yoga classes for the neighborhood) and generates revenues.\nAt Lamab, activities such as graffitti, rollers, dance open a window of sharing for both users and initiators. Living arts require lot of interaction which strengthen the communal life when its well balanced.\n\n**The Community Agreement. Which could be effective principles, structures for the Reef: financially (do people have to pay and for what?), socially (who is included/ excluded? how are decisions made? how are conflicts resolved?), spatially (who can access space? how can someone leave the community?).**\n----\n\n_The group only focused on the financial aspect of the question_.\nFinancially, a common pot could help to share money for everythings the community might need such as food and basic expenses.\nRessources can be financial but also related to skills or just people giving time for community.\nAbout the structure, many forms exist for sure : asbl, cooperative, foundation.\nFoundation looks relevant to create a trust and generate assets. The foundation is a legal structure that appear to protect assets that will turn into a patrimony. This patrimony is here for everytime.\nIn an ideal situation, everybody put the same account in the pot at the beginning but it depends because not everyone will come with the same individual situation in the community.\n\n## What did YOU learn?

Please provide the Italian reference, which maybe I can have Google translate.\n\nYour descriptions use a good deal of specialized terminology which I'd like to have defined more concretely and with examples so as to understand it better.\n\nIn principle I agree: the way our economy works at present is not only soulless; it also has a hard time adapting to change without causing a good deal of pain, especially to workers, who are laid off from companies in old industries and abandoned, while then new companies in new industries hire other workers with new skills. Then the cycle repeats. A number of European countries have tried to protect workers by writing laws which make it a lot harder and/or more expensive to lay workers off -- this does not help -- all it does is prevent companies from adapting to new technologies. What would be needed (in theory) would be a cluster of companies which, amoeba-like, could as a whole constantly morph around the edges such that workers' skills and aptitudes would be enhanced and managed so as to bring in and use new technologies, which would not be so rule-bound that adaptation is stultified.\n\nThis would be more in the field of business management than in economics as such, although certainly if it became anything like the norm it would have significant Micro and eventually Macro effects, such as blending working and training, reducing unemployment, increasing innovation, localizing change, etc.\n\nBut I get ahead of myself -- is this what this \"cluster\" has in mind? I worry about politicization -- if everyone involved is a leftist, then on one hand I can see why it would be hard to make progress in the general business community; plus this would make it hard to become big (I resist the idea that large companies are by nature incapable of being managed in a human-oriented way). But maybe that is not a factor. One reason I mention it is because as far as I can tell, all communally-oriented organizations so far have been held together by some form of faith or ideology -- the examples are monasteries, especially those that manufacture products such as wine or liqueur or beer, or the Israeli kibbutzim, the various mostly 19th century socialist communities and then again those of the 60s, not to mention various now-failed or discredited Communist experiences, all of which have ended without issue once the fervor inevitably fell. This might mean that humans are incapable of communally-oriented organizations unless supported by ideology, which on one hand would not be a very complimentary aspect of humanity, but on the other would mean we should not waste effort trying to create such communities and then ironically labeling them \"long-term\"... But perhaps there is a new \"company social glue\" of management practice that these people have found -- if so, what is it?", "created_at": "2020-05-19 06:55:31.006360", "updated_at": "2020-05-19 06:55:31.006360", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 499, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 13.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61885, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10242, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Dunno.

This was an example on how local initiatives could collaborate( unlike the common ridesharing example ) and the question for this already established network would be how to enhance this so collaboration is done on various levels, not only crowd funding.\n\n2- During the discussion on the harmonious hackathons, an idea poped up ( I think this was between\u00a0 @lauren @jamesL @K @Dorotea in berlin ) about an exchange between different hackathon tracks. so one can be working on his/her idea for most of the week but for 2 days exchange with another one and work on a different idea. I am thinking out loud here and I am not sure if we can reuse this idea as a a sort of \"special contribution\" if participants have time for it, so for example someone working on a hacker/maker space can exchange for a week and work with another initiative on biogas and vice versa. of course this exchange would need specific challenges, time and willingness to risk and try .......... what do you think ?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-30 14:55:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.451463", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 244, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21100, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 5115, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Work in progress</b>\n\nYou can follow the word doc <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSzPy-yQ9yrB6mtJtsvNSB3Uu2yCOCLxYJa0X84wRaM/edit#\">here</a>.

PiS zale\u017cy, \u017ceby w Polsce co\u015b sz\u0142o do przodu, a tamci to z\u0142odzieje po prostu. Kupa z\u0142odziei. Jak z tymi ustawami o VAT, \u017ce go mo\u017cna by\u0142o odcia\u0107, to dla kogo oni to robili? Przed\u0142u\u017cali ten czas na odci\u0105gni\u0119cie VATu, to przecie\u017c robili dla swoich kolesi. To trzeba by\u0107 idiot\u0105, \u017ceby tego nie rozumie\u0107. Ja to sobie tak t\u0142umacz\u0119, \u017ce ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy g\u0142osowali na PO musieli na tym korzysta\u0107. To trzeba mie\u0107 co\u015b z g\u0142ow\u0105 nie tak, \u017ceby nie widzie\u0107 jaka jest r\u00f3\u017cnica. \n\nPiS te\u017c nie jest najlepszy, ka\u017cda w\u0142adza ci\u0105gnie do siebie, ale r\u00f3\u017cnica jest potworna. To nie chodzi o mnie, ale wida\u0107, \u017ce daj\u0105 ludziom potrzebuj\u0105cym. Dziel\u0105 si\u0119 ze spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwem. Przyk\u0142ad: Orlen wypracowa\u0142 przez ostatnie cztery lata rz\u0105d\u00f3w PO trzy miliardy z\u0142otych, przez cztery ostatnie lata rz\u0105d\u00f3w PiS - siedemna\u015bcie miliard\u00f3w. Gdzie si\u0119 podzia\u0142o te kilkana\u015bciemiliard\u00f3w? Gdzi\u0119 si\u0119 to podzia\u0142o? Oni robili to dla siebie, dla wtajemniczonych. Mo\u017cna by\u0142o ukr\u00f3ci\u0107 t\u0119 kradzie\u017c VATu du\u017co wcze\u015bniej. Taka r\u00f3\u017cnica w dochodach pa\u0144stwowej sp\u00f3\u0142ki! To jest zupe\u0142nie inne podej\u015bcie do narodu, do pa\u0144stwa, do ludzi - po prostu. Tamci trzymali tylko ze swoimi tylko i wy\u0142\u0105cznie. Inaczej nie mog\u0119 tego wyt\u0142umaczy\u0107. Staram si\u0119 nie emocjonowa\u0107, bo mam inne problemy, ale mnie to wkurza. No wkurza! We\u017amy ostatnie wybory do Europarlamentu. Partia, kt\u00f3ra kiedy\u015b mieni\u0142a si\u0119 postsolidarno\u015bciow\u0105, to s\u0105 praktycznie upad\u0142e anio\u0142y. Niesio\u0142oski na przyk\u0142ad. Cz\u0142owiek zion\u0105cy nienawi\u015bci\u0105, ale to jednak wzorzec walki o niepodleg\u0142o\u015b\u0107. I teraz Koalicja na w\u0142asnych plecach, a w\u0142a\u015bciwie ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy na nich g\u0142osowali wywindowali do Europarlamentu Millera, Huebner, Belk\u0119, Cimoszewicza- przecie\u017c to czy\u015bci komuni\u015bci. Do tego jeszcze Ar\u0142ukowicz, Kopacz, gwiazdor Sikorski ten od \"do\u017cynania watah\". A teraz wida\u0107 kto jest kim. Wida\u0107 czym jest PO, z kim trzyma. Jak tak mo\u017cna wywindowa\u0107 takie polityczne trupy. Schetyna to jest k\u0142amca, jedno m\u00f3wi rano, a drugie wieczorem. Raz jest za LGBT, a raz przeciw. Kompletne dno polityczne. \n\nA jak widz\u0119 tematyk\u0119 LGBT? Nie mam nic do tych ludzi. Niech sobie robi\u0105 co chc\u0105. W domu. Ale to nachalne propagowanie choroby, bo ja to uwa\u017cam za chorob\u0119 m\u00f3zgu, kt\u00f3rej lekarze jeszcze nie potrafi\u0105 leczy\u0107. Ale jest to choroba m\u00f3zgu. Wychodzenie z tym na ulic\u0119 i propagowanie swojej choroby. To tak jakby kto\u015b chory na gru\u017alic\u0119 chodzi\u0142 po ulicy i chwali\u0142 si\u0119 swoj\u0105 chorob\u0105. Oni chc\u0105 mie\u0107 specjalne przywileje, a przecie\u017c to jest mniejszo\u015b\u0107.  Oni chc\u0105 mie\u0107 wi\u0119ksze prawa ni\u017c reszta spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Mnie WHO nie przekonuje. Uzna\u0142o, \u017ce homoseksualizm jest normalno\u015bci\u0105. To si\u0119 szybko rozesz\u0142o po ca\u0142ym \u015bwiecie, ale wielu z tej komisji bardzo szybko si\u0119 wycofa\u0142o, o czym powszechnie nie wiadomo. To si\u0119 rozesz\u0142o, \u017ce to co\u015b normalnego i od tamtej pory wszyscy uwa\u017c\u0105j\u0105 to za zupe\u0142nie zdrowe. \n\nNo jak mo\u017ce by\u0107 zdrowa osoba, kt\u00f3ra ma takie pogl\u0105dy? Jak to Cejrowski kiedy napisa\u0142 kiedy\u015b pi\u0119knie w ksi\u0105\u017cce swojej \"Z ca\u0142\u0105 pewn\u0105\u015bci\u0105 nienormalne jest pakowa\u0107 t\u0142ok do rury wydechowej\". Niech sobie \u017cyj\u0105, robi\u0105 co chc\u0105. Je\u017celi mnie to nie dotyczy, nie s\u0105 nachalni, to co mnie to obchodzi. Ka\u017cdy ma w domu swoje \u017cycie, ale to nachalne epatowanie tym jest wkurzaj\u0105ce, to s\u0105 przebiera\u0144cy, jaka\u015b ekstrema. Moim zdaniem Ci epatuj\u0105cy to te\u017c jest w ich gronie mniejszo\u015b\u0107. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce jaki\u015b zdrowy na umy\u015ble homoseksualista wcale nie chce tym epatowa\u0107. Tak jak te ich marsze r\u00f3wno\u015bci. Nigdy te parady nie s\u0105 we wszystkich miastach r\u00f3wnocze\u015bnie, bo uczestnik\u00f3w jest ma\u0142o. Oni si\u0119 przemieszczaj\u0105. To s\u0105 ca\u0142y czas ci sami ludzie. A najbardziej wkurzaj\u0105ce jest to, \u017ce platformach wi\u0105z\u0105cych tych ludzi s\u0105 reklamy du\u017cych firm, kt\u00f3re to sponsoruj\u0105. Maj\u0105 w tym jaki\u015b interes. Trudno powiedzie\u0107 jaki, ale jaki\u015b maj\u0105. \n\nPodoba mi si\u0119 jak PiS walczy o Polsk\u0119 na arenie mi\u0119dzynarodowej, a nie tylko przytakuje: \"Ja, ja, jawohl\". Przecie\u017c Tusk by\u0142 na rozkazy, to by\u0142a marionetka. Co on zrobi\u0142 dla Polski, wr\u0119cz odwrotnie, on by\u0142 przeciwko Polsce. Jak naprzyk\u0142ad jego wypowied\u017a o karach dla kraj\u00f3w, kt\u00f3re nie chc\u0105 przyjmowa\u0107 imigrant\u00f3w. Ka\u017cdy kraj \npowinien o tym sam decydowa\u0107. Merkel zaprosi\u0142a Imigrant\u00f3w do Polski to niech si\u0119 z tym teraz buja.

Ja by\u0142em w Szwecji nie raz, widzia\u0142em jak to wygl\u0105da. Tragedia. Ca\u0142e osiedla opanowywane przez rodziny islamskie. Szwedzi si\u0119 wyprowadzaj\u0105.

Jak zaczyna\u0142em je\u017adzi\u0107 do Szwecji to by\u0142o du\u017ce zaufanie spo\u0142eczne, otwarte samochody, domy, rowery stoj\u0105ce przed domem. I nic si\u0119 nie dzia\u0142o. Z czasem jak zacz\u0119li pojawia\u0107 si\u0119 imigranci zacz\u0119\u0142y pojawia\u0107 si\u0119 alarmy. U nas te\u017c jest za du\u017co Ukrai\u0144c\u00f3w.

Ostatnio jaki\u015b dziesi\u0119ciolatek biega\u0142 po szkole i krzycza\u0142, \u017ce Bandera to jego bohater. Zwr\u00f3ci\u0142 mu uwage Polak i by\u0142a afera, \u017ce jest rasist\u0105. To co kiedy\u015b zrobili to by\u0142o straszne.

To by\u0142o chore ta rze\u017a Wo\u0142y\u0144ska. To by\u0142a dzicz, zwyrodnienie totalne. Zwierz\u0119ta tak nie robi\u0105 jak oni robili. Hitlerowcy tacy nie byli.  Czas mija, a Bandera dalej jest ich bohaterem. Nie wiadomo co z nimi b\u0119dzie, mog\u0105 si\u0119 odwr\u00f3ci\u0107. Jest niepok\u00f3j. Moja daleka rodzina ucieka\u0142a stamt\u0105d. Moim zdaniem takie kraje jak Francja, Szwecja czy Niemcy, stan\u0105 sie muzu\u0142ma\u0144skie. Mno\u017c\u0105 si\u0119 jak szczury i przejm\u0105 to. Anglia sobie poradzi, bo to s\u0105 m\u0105drzy ludzie i jak przyjdzie co do czego to bch wygodni\u0105 i tyle. Ale Europa sobie nie poradzi. \n\nA co do religii, ja kiedy\u015b by\u0142em mocno wierz\u0105cy. Tak samo moja rodzina, w szczeg\u00f3lno\u015bci m\u00f3j dziadek.

Od tamtej pory przesta\u0142em wierzy\u0107 w instytucj\u0119 ko\u015bcio\u0142a.

Highlighting the entire post is better, but then makes it hard to code due to the scrollover function. So the code to one word could be explained by that. Otherwise I'd never just code a single word. \n\nThe only other thing that could be making things messy is that duplicates keep arising.

So, I worry about this idea: Poland: work & employment + family/work-life-balance, reproductive rights (e.g. abortions, contraception, etc.) while Czechia: health and social care and the housing issues\n1.1.\tWhy would we have this \u201cdivision of labor\u201d?\n1.2.\tBesides, I see a lot of mentions of both issues \u201cassigned\u201d to Czechia in the Polish conversation.\n2.\tIt is imperative that we have these conversations, as much as possible, in \u201cnative\u201d languages. I see the point of having also a general conversation in English, but it should be subsidiary. There is no ethnography without \u201cnatives\u201d using their own language.\n3.\tPoint (2) is also related to the goal of building a cross-national conversation cum network. Again, it is something I support as a great tool for getting people together to try to solve their problems, but this objective needs to be counter-balanced by a more ethnographic goal of trying to understand people on their own terms. And most importantly perhaps, many people we want to engage and hear from do not speak English.\n\n@amelia, @Jirka_Kocian, @SZdenek, and @Wojt: what do you think?\n\nAll, I am going - FINALLY - on a short vacation tomorrow.

Owned by a German NGO, it rescued 42 migrants from the Mediterranean; was denied authorization to dock in the Italian island of Lampedusa; but docked anyway on humanitarian grounds. Its captain was arrested. As I write, it is unclear how it will end (here is the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/26/ngo-boat-carrying-migrants-defies-matteo-salvini-veto-lampedusa-italy)). Whatever happens next, I fear it will affect not just its protagonists (the 42 migrants, the captain, the Italian authorities and the latter\u2019s political leaders), but all Italians. Those effects will be strongly negative. They could even disintegrate Italy\u2019s sentiment of national unity.\n\nLet me explain. Italians are human beings, and like all humans prone to overheating during discussions. To overstep the limits of civility, and cross from discussion into fighting. That\u2019s normal. Just step into an Italian caf\u00e9 on a Monday, and watch people discuss the Sunday\u2019s football matches. It is very common to overhear people accuse each other of \u201cstealing a victory\u201d, or even \u201cbuying off the referee\u201d. Of course, the actual people in those discussion were not even within a hundred kilometer radius from the stadium. Their accusers know this well, but they associate the opposite team\u2019s supporters to the alleged wrongdoings of the team\u2019s players or management. **Humans are good at factionalism: pitting \u201cyou\u201d against \u201cus\u201d, [according to biologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection), is innate in *homo sapiens*** .\n\nSomething similar happens in the Sea-Watch 3 discussion. Many limits of civility and courtesy have been overstepped. I hope I am wrong, but I see the country resolving into two opposite factions of supporters. The stadium where the actual match is being fought is near-empty, but Italy\u2019s bars are full of people shouting not only at the players, but at each other. I am reading heavy, heavy words: \u201ckill them\u201d, \u201csink them\u201d, \u201cinhuman\u201d and so on.\n\nUnfortunately, I predict the echo of these words will be with us for a long time. **This has something to do with the Internet** .\n\nOn the one hand, the Internet provides us with an archive of everything we share: the joy and the anger, the measured arguments and the insults and venting. It never forgets. If you, today, use the Net to demand that the navy sinks a ship full of unfortunate people, or to call minister X or representative Y a Nazi, you leave a digital trace that will not go away easily, or at all. Even if you repent, that post, or that tweet, will hang from your neck like the albatro from the neck of Coleridge\u2019s Old Mariner.\n\nOn the other hand, social media tend to push us into \u201cconsensus bubbles\u201d where most people are close to our own position. [According to Zeynep Tufekci](http://ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads), these bubbles are not static, but carry us towards more and more extreme positions with time and the consumption of social media.\n\n**Together, these two effects create a situation where our most extreme positions become a cage that we can no longer break free of** . If we change our minds, we know that someone will always be able to rub them in our face. And, once we express them, we find ourselves part of a bubble that *rewards* us for taking it: admires us, respects us as someone who is not afraid to \u201ctell it like it is\u201d. In this situation, it is hard to change your opinion.\n\nConclusions. **In the age of social media, when a faultline forms in a community it tends to grow wider, crystallize, become irreversible** . Forgiveness and reconciliation becomes harder. This is my reading of what happened in the UK: in 2015, the words \u201cLeaver\u201d and \u201cRemainer\u201d did not exist. In 2016 they were shorthand for \u201csomeone who votes Leave/Remain in the EU referendum\u201d. In 2019 they are identities: go to any dating website, it\u2019s full of people saying \u201cI could never date a Leaver/Remainer\u201d. Now, these identities are completely artificial, but the combined effect of unerasable records and consensus bubbles makes them effective anyway. I fear that, with Sea-Watch 3, we Italians have found our own faultline, our own Brexit.\n\nIn the short run, as the British example shows, it is likely that we will get mired into a continuous conflict that will cripple our ability to develop the country. After the referendum, the British government has done practically no new policy, not even around leaving the EU. And in the long run? No one knows. I fear that a deeply divided national community is unviable.\n\nSo what next? My opinion does not matter. **If it did, I would use it to ask my countrymen to be compassionate, not (only) with the migrants on the Sea-Watch 3, but with each other** . A person can, in a moment of frustration, get carried away and *say* something horrible without *being* a horrible person. The \u201cenemy\u201d that torments us on Twitter is just another human being, with a family, a car insurance to pay, maybe a dog. A couple of layers beneath his offensive language there might be arguments worth discussing.\n\nNo one has a monopoly on Italian-ness. But I like to remember this: after the fall of the fascist regime and the end of World War II, Italy gave itself a national unity government. Its minister of justice was communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, himself exiled during fascism. His most significant policy was a general amnesty. rolled out as an emergency measure, before Italy even had a constitution or a parliament. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togliatti_amnesty) notes:\n\n> it pardoned and reduced sentences for Italian Fascists and Partisans alike. The amnesty included common crimes as well as political ones committed during World War II. In practice however, Fascists and collaborators benefited far more from the amnesty than Partisans did.\n\nThis move had far-reaching implications. Those who had been complicit in involving Italy in a war, and collaborated with an invading force, got home free, just like those who had fought against these choices. Fair? No. And indeed, Togliatti paid a high price to the backlash, also within his own party. But the government, and Togliatti himself, decided that reconciliation and mutual forgiveness was the only path towards a reasonably cohesive, stable nation. Conflict happens, but to move forward together reconciliation is necessary. **Italy is a republic based on that reconciliation, and I do not think it has a future if we we won\u2019t be able to reverse this trend towards entrenched positions and mutual, public insult**. I hope we realize this, before it is too late.", "created_at": "2019-06-29 10:31:35.871421", "updated_at": "2019-06-29 18:52:22.572825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1159, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 234.6, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 2915, 4683, 1856, 3, 137, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62392, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11021, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Ok, great.

Na koniec trafi\u0142am na lekarza, kt\u00f3ry skierowa\u0142 mnie na rehabilitacj\u0119, ale by\u0142o za p\u00f3\u017ano, \u017ceby rehabilitacja przynios\u0142a oczekiwane skutki. Pa\u0144stwo ma zagwarantowa\u0107 opiek\u0119 zdrowotn\u0105, to j\u0105 gwarantuje. Nikt si\u0119 nie przejmuje tob\u0105 jak nie umierasz, a poniewa\u017c jest to system \u017ale zarz\u0105dzany i pewnie niedofinansowany, bo pieni\u0105dze id\u0105 najpewniej nie tam, gdzie potrzeba, mamy co mamy. Z mojej perspektywy leczy\u0107 si\u0119 prywatnie wcale nie jest lepiej ni\u017c leczy\u0107 si\u0119 w publicznej plac\u00f3wce pod wzgl\u0119dem tego jak si\u0119 tob\u0105 zajmuj\u0105. Z partnerem by\u0142am u lekarza prywatnie i w publicznej plac\u00f3wce. Nie widzia\u0142am zmiany jako\u015bciowej. Najwi\u0119ksz\u0105 przeszkod\u0105 by\u0142 czas. Chodzi o kolejki. W przypadku mojego partnera, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 powa\u017cne problemy z kolanem, nie chodzi\u0142o tylko o kolejki, ale o problem ze zdiagnozowaniem. Dlatego nie widz\u0119 r\u00f3\u017cnicy w leczeniu prywatnym i publicznym. Lekarze nie traktowali tego jako wa\u017cnej dla pacjenta sytuacji, w kt\u00f3rej cierpi. M\u00f3wili, \u017ce mo\u017ce trzeba zoperowa\u0107 albo \u017ce \u201emo\u017ce si\u0119 zagoi, a jak si\u0119 zagoi, to nie b\u0119d\u0119 wysy\u0142a\u0142 pana na operacj\u0119\u201d. Jeden m\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017ce operowa\u0107, drugi \u017ce nie, trzeci, \u017ceby pr\u00f3bowa\u0107 zszywa\u0107 itd. Jak si\u0119 zdecydowali\u015bmy na operacj\u0119, lekarz powiedzia\u0142 \u017ce nie wie ile to b\u0119dzie kosztowa\u0142o. Rozumiem, \u017ce maj\u0105 tak\u0105 procedur\u0119, \u017ce najpierw musz\u0105 zobaczy\u0107, \u017ceby oceni\u0107 czy uda si\u0119 zszy\u0107 czy wycina\u0107. Jednak wniosek jest niestety taki, \u017ce najlepiej mie\u0107 znajomo\u015bci. Wtedy wszystko jest mo\u017cliwe: ka\u017cd\u0105 kolejk\u0119 da si\u0119 przy\u015bpieszy\u0107 czy zrobi\u0107 zabieg, na kt\u00f3ry jak przyjdziesz z ulicy nie masz \u017cadnych szans. Zdecydowali\u015bmy si\u0119 jeszcze skonsultowa\u0107 decyzj\u0119 o operacji z innym lekarzem. Ten, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 operowa\u0107 powiedzia\u0142, \u017ce to, co boli partnera, to nie jest to, co mu wytnie. Co sprawi, \u017ce b\u0119dzie \u017cy\u0142 z bol\u0105cym kolanem i bez \u0142\u0119kotki. Trafili\u015bmy do jeszcze innego lekarza, kt\u00f3ry okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce podobnie jak m\u00f3j partner, interesuje si\u0119 motoryzacj\u0105, widuj\u0105 si\u0119 na jakich\u015b zjazdach. Wtedy zacz\u0119\u0142a si\u0119 inna rozmowa. To jest przykre, \u017ce kto\u015b zaczyna z tob\u0105 rozmawia\u0107, jak ci\u0119 zauwa\u017ca. Nie jeste\u015b zwyk\u0142ym szarym pacjentem. Ten lekarz powiedzia\u0142, \u017ceby nie i\u015b\u0107 na razie na operacj\u0119. Zapisa\u0107 si\u0119 publicznie w kolejk\u0119 na operacj\u0119 \u2013 termin za dwa lata. Wtedy zobaczymy czy jest konieczna, bo faktycznie potrzeba du\u017co czasu, \u017ceby \u0142\u0119kotka sama si\u0119 zregenerowa\u0142a. A prywatnie na operacj\u0119 mo\u017cna zapisa\u0107 si\u0119 w ka\u017cdym momencie, wi\u0119c na razie zrezygnowali\u015bmy z niej. \n\nReligia to dla mnie cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 tradycji, w kt\u00f3rej by\u0142am wychowana. Nie jestem do ko\u0144ca osob\u0105 wierz\u0105c\u0105, ale uczestnicz\u0119 w obrz\u0119dach. Robi\u0119 to, bo nie przeszkadza mi, \u017ceby p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 do koscio\u0142a w trakcie jakiego\u015b wydrzenia. Tak jak niekt\u00f3rzy w niedziel\u0119 ogl\u0105daj\u0105 telewizj\u0119, to jak to jest wa\u017cne dla mojej rodziny, nie widz\u0119 przeszkody, \u017ceby w tym uczestniczy\u0107. Nie uzale\u017cniam systemu warto\u015bci od ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Warto\u015bci czerpi\u0119 z \u017cycia. Wa\u017cne jest, \u017ceby by\u0107 w zgodzie ze sob\u0105, \u017ceby mie\u0107 poczucie, \u017ce robi\u0119 to, co jest s\u0142uszne. Moim zdaniem og\u00f3lnie warto\u015bci czerpie si\u0119: z rodziny, ze szko\u0142y, niekt\u00f3rzy z ko\u015bcio\u0142a, z grup wsparcia. To, gdzie widz\u0119 autorytety, zale\u017cy od dziedziny, np.: Bodnar jest autorytetem dla mnie w prawach cz\u0142owieka, a kto\u015b inny w innej dziedzinie.\n\nZgodnie z konkordatem i praktyk\u0105 ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 katolicki jest bardzo silnie zwi\u0105zany z pa\u0144stwem. To zas\u0142uga nie tylko ko\u015bcio\u0142a, ale te\u017c poszczeg\u00f3lnych polityk\u00f3w, co nie wiem czy p\u0142ynie z ich przekona\u0144 czy kalkulacji. Wszystkie partie opr\u00f3cz Wiosny i Razem czy jakich\u015b pomniejszych partii, kt\u00f3rych nawet nie znam, s\u0105 zwi\u0105zane z ko\u015bcio\u0142em katolickim. Ten zwi\u0105zek to nie jest pozytywne zjawisko. Nie ma prze\u0142o\u017cenia na popraw\u0119 jako\u015bci \u017cycia albo na to, \u017ce ludzie s\u0105 lepsi, \u017ce ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 robi co\u015b dla spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Jeden ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 dominuje w Polsce. Nie wiem czy to si\u0119 zmieni i kto to m\u00f3g\u0142by zrobi\u0107, skoro politycy wiedz\u0105, jakie to ma znaczenie polityczne, a zrobi\u0105 wszystko, \u017ceby t\u0119 w\u0142adz\u0119 zdoby\u0107. P\u00f3ki co nie ma w spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie zdecydowanej wi\u0119kszo\u015bci za tym, \u017ceby ukr\u00f3ci\u0107 zwi\u0105zki pa\u0144stwa i ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Chocia\u017c wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce wiele os\u00f3b po prostu si\u0119 tym nie przejmuje. Nie ma to dla nich a\u017c takiego znaczenia. \n\nG\u0142osuj\u0119 w wi\u0119kszo\u015bci w wyborach, w zale\u017cno\u015bci od tego czy mam na kogo. Zale\u017cy to od os\u00f3b kandyduj\u0105cych. Nie ma partii idealnej. Czasami nawet jak uwa\u017cam, \u017ce dana osoba jest ok, to nie chc\u0119 popiera\u0107 postulat\u00f3w partii, z kt\u00f3rymi si\u0119 nie zgadzam. Mam \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, \u017ce w Polsce oddaje si\u0119 g\u0142os na partie, a nie na ludzi, ale nie chc\u0119 odda\u0107 mojego g\u0142osu, je\u015bli nie jestem przekonana, \u017ce dana osoba powinna ten g\u0142os otrzyma\u0107. W ostatnich wyborach te\u017c zag\u0142osowa\u0142am na konkretn\u0105 osob\u0119. Wiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce by\u0107 mo\u017ce marnuj\u0119 sw\u00f3j g\u0142os. Najgorsze jest to, \u017ce politycy decyduj\u0105 o tym, co si\u0119 tutaj dzieje, a nie ludzie. Nasze \u017cycie zale\u017cy od nich, a politycy nie prowadz\u0105 dialogu. Dzia\u0142aj\u0105 na zasadzie kupna - sprzeda\u017cy. Najpierw nas kupuj\u0105, a potem robi\u0105 z tob\u0105, co im si\u0119 podoba. Da\u0142a\u015b si\u0119 sprzeda\u0107 i tyle. Nie ma takiego my\u015blenia u polityk\u00f3w ani prze\u015bwiadczenia u obywateli, \u017ce nie wystarczy p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 raz na cztery lata na wybory i mie\u0107 spok\u00f3j, tylko mie\u0107 poczucie odpowiedzialno\u015bci przed lud\u017ami. Politycy powinni odpowiada\u0107 na potrzeby, a nie kreowa\u0107 sobie sytuacj\u0119, kt\u00f3ra ma przynie\u015b\u0107 poparcie. PIS \u015bwietnie wyczu\u0142 luk\u0119 w systemie, nie by\u0142o tego wcze\u015bniej, a ludzie chc\u0105 mie\u0107 poczucie, \u017ce pa\u0144stwo b\u0119dzie ich wspiera\u0142o. Uwa\u017cam, ze pa\u0144stwo powinno wspiera\u0107 obywateli, tylko pytanie jak ma to robi\u0107 i z jak\u0105 intencj\u0105. W tym przypadku to jest ewidentnie kupowanie ludzi przez PIS, bo \u017cadna inna partia tego nie zrobi\u0142a nawet w minimalnym stopniu i maj\u0105 przez to wysokie poparcie. Niestety robi\u0105 rzecz normaln\u0105. To jest co\u015b, co w innych pa\u0144stwach funkcjonuje od d\u0142ugiego czasu i ludzie maj\u0105 przekonanie, \u017ce tak powinno by\u0107, \u017ce ludzie powinni by\u0107 przez pa\u0144stwo wspierani, a jednocze\u015bnie pa\u0144stwo du\u017co zabiera w podatkach i op\u0142atach. Nie mam problemu z wyp\u0142acaniem 500 z\u0142 jako wsparcie dla dzieci. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce to powinno by\u0107 zrobione w inny spos\u00f3b. Powinno przede wszystkim promowa\u0107 postawy aktywne, np.: poprzez wi\u0119ksze ulgi podatkowe. Z drugiej strony to nie jest a\u017c tak widoczne jak dawanie ludziom pieni\u0119dzy do r\u0119ki. Nie wiem czy to jest instrument populistyczny. Na pewno PIS kierowa\u0142o si\u0119 ch\u0119ci\u0105 zdobycia w\u0142adzy. Nie dali tych pieni\u0119dzy dlatego, \u017ce zauwa\u017cyli, \u017ce w Polsce tego nie ma i trzeba to zrobi\u0107, bo taki jest standard. Zrobili to po to, \u017ceby kupi\u0107 sobie poparcie. M\u00f3wi si\u0119 jednocze\u015bnie o obni\u017ceniu podatk\u00f3w. By\u0107 mo\u017ce te pieni\u0105dze s\u0105 na bie\u017c\u0105co konsumowane i wracaj\u0105 do bud\u017cetu, ale czy z drugiej strony to b\u0119dzie nap\u0119dza\u0142o gospodark\u0119, to nie wiem. Pytanie brzmi: czym ma by\u0107 ta kwota? Zach\u0119t\u0105 do rodzenia dzieci, bo b\u0119dziesz mie\u0107 500 z\u0142 na utrzymanie? Nie utrzymasz za to dziecka. Czy to ma by\u0107 gratyfikacja za ponoszenie trudu wychowawczego. Dla jednych te pieni\u0105dze s\u0105 wtedy niczym, a dla kogo\u015b kto ma bardzo ma\u0142o, nie rozwi\u0105zuj\u0105 podstawowych problem\u00f3w To p\u00f3j\u015bcie na \u0142atwizn\u0119 \u2013 damy wam wszystkim.

They also fit well in the [Remote work counselling](https://live.edgeryders.eu/14686) platform.\n\nTo proceed with the **follow ups on the events** we need to work on two levels:\n\nFor outreach purposes:\n\n* A summary (and authorial) article with focus on a couple of interesting points.\n\n* An editorial meeting (with the copywriter's presence) is scheduled for the day following the event to highlight and match the topics with the strategic objectives\n* The writer (if not present during the event) needs access to video and the transcript\n* There is a shared calendar in the outreach group for copywriting requests\n\nFor coding purposes:\n\n* A complete conversation is necessary\n* Who said what is important\n* The ethnographer software cannot code the two hours video and the transcript may be difficult to code \u2013 we need to organise a separate call on how to deal with this\n\n**Video publishing** requires:\n\n* changing of the snippet in the consent form\n* creating the funnel to give access to videos only through previous registration on the platform\n\nThere is a **research task force for NGI** coming up \u2013 our attention is needed to shape the application for the MozFest together with DeLab.\n\nTopics on the platform: we should arrange a meeting with coordinators for both projects and ethnographers to discuss the direction in which the discussions on the platform are going and align.\n\nFor **POPREBEL**: a conference is happening in February where Jan wants us to present the ethnographic research - @marina will inform @amelia.\n\n**Budget allocations** \u2013 we should proceed as planned\n\n@alberto is creating a system that works with Tulip to create on the fly semantic graphs based on Edgeryders data, posting it in the Github, with a specific branch for Poprebel.\n\nThe **outreach strategy** is driving new people to the discussions, but the content sometimes might be too far off the focus \u2013 requires a separate discussion with @amelia and Jan\n\nLinkedin campaigns: concluding the work on numbers \u2013 very good response on CIC and Worldbuilding: 1 participant every 6 feedbacks received while Poprebel food event had a 1:8 result. Precision is necessary to address possible problems and / or methods to apply: better search words combination, language, number of contacts necessary to create the needed response.\n\nThe main objective is to bring new participants to engage on the platform.

It all started in 2011 when our co-founders were researching how to solve youth unemployment for a Council of Europe project.\n\nWe built an open online platform and hundreds of people shared how they were responding to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. We needed a way to process all this information, so developed a methodology and some software to help us see what all of these conversations were telling us.\n\nSince then, we have brought thousands of people from all walks of life to the Edgeryders platform to find solutions to today\u2019s most pressing issues - from how we can provide healthcare for everyone to ways we can help fight the climate catastrophe.\n\nAn organisation that was born in a crisis, today the world is facing another unprecedented time and Edgeryders wants to help individuals and organisations navigate this new territory. Covid has dramatically impacted our lives and has changed the way that we will work forever.\n\nWhile we believe that working remotely has a huge amount of benefits, we think that when done badly, it can be detrimental to individuals and organisations. Long-standing challenges that predate the current pandemic will continue to cause organisations loss of time, money and energy into the future if not remedied.\n\nWe are leveraging the 6000 people of our Edgeryders community, many of whom - including us - have huge experience of working in and organising distributed teams, to help.\n\nOver the coming months we are drawing on 26 years of experience for a book so that leaders can build the right culture and mindset to successfully run a distributed organisation.\n\nWe are also creating a living step-by-step extensive manual on how teams can adapt to this new way of work. We are also producing a high quality online course or MOOC, to provide organisations and individuals with the necessary skill set required to implement a remote model successfully.\n\nIt won\u2019t be an easy feat;  **we are launching a crowdfunding campaign to turn our vision into a reality and we need your help.**\n\nWe need to cover the cost of writing, editing, designing, developing lesson plans, filming, illustrating and paying expert instructors.\n\n**If like us, you think more clarity and learning is needed surrounding distributed and remote work, then support our efforts by donating to our crowdfunding page here.**\n\n# Step by step you will be able to take the wellbeing of yourself, your team and your organisation into your own hands, no matter where those hands might be localised.\n\n## What you will get if you contribute to the campaign", "created_at": "2020-11-26 19:12:21.627685", "updated_at": "2020-12-02 08:22:22.380480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 530, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 50.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85025, "user_id": 6799, "topic_id": 14488, "post_number": 24, "raw": "**If you are interested and want to join the event comment here.

I am translating the [editorial overview](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--1-2) of our Distributed Collaboration manual. Here we go.\n\nBenvenuta/o al manuale di collaborazione distribuita creato attraverso collaborazione distribuita. :blush:  Per cominciare, questa sezione spiega il ruolo e le connessioni reciproche delle varie sezioni di questo documento. Nota bene: il [documento originale](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263) \u00e8 in inglese. Se qualcuno desidera collaborare alla traduzione, si metta in contatto con [alberto](mailto:alberto@edgeryders.eu).\n\n**Che vantaggi ci sono per te?** Questo manuale vuole rendere il tuo stile di collaborazione distribuita semplice, piacevole ed efficiente. Una collaborazione serena ed efficiente \u00e8 sempre un risultato di gruppo: non puoi ottenerla da sola. Dovrai imparare a rendere semplice e piacevole l'esperienza dei tuoi colleghi, il che significa essenzialmente \"essere una buona cittadina\" della tua organizzazione. I tuoi colleghi faranno lo stesso per te, e questo \u00e8 il modo in cui la tua propria esperienza di lavoro diventa semplice e piacevole. Esploriamo pi\u00f9 a fondo questo aspetto nella sezione \"[Il segreto di una piacevole collaborazione distribuita](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--1-4)\". In buona parte, \u00e8 una questione di valori: all'inizio di un'esperienza di collaborazione distribuita l'esperienza sar\u00e0 inevitabilmente confusa e sconnessa, nell'attesa che una massa critica dei tuoi colleghi faccia il primo passo e costruisca il nuovo sistema. Puoi essere tu stessa, per\u00f2, a fare il primo passo. Anche se questo non ti d\u00e0 benefici immediati, ti permette di contemplare la bellezza del sistema che stai contribuendo a costruire, e di provare orgoglio per esserne uno dei pionieri. Il nostro consiglio principale, quindi, \u00e8 di vivere la costruzione di un ambiente di lavoro a collaborazione distribuita come **un'operazione orientata ai valori**: libert\u00e0 individuale, riconoscimento del contributo di ciascuno, sostegno reciproco tra colleghi, equilibrio vita-lavoro. \n\n**Viaggi di lavoro**. Devi fare un viaggio per lavoro oltreoceano. Siccome sono solo gli anni 20 e i jet elettrici clima-neutri sono ancora nel futuro, vorresti evitarlo. Per determinare se lo spostamento \u00e8 davvero necessario, abbiamo [alcune indicazioni sul nostro manuale per viaggiare ecologici](https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/10552#heading--1-1). La sezione \"[Trucchi per le chiamate](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2-18)\" contiene nozioni utili per rimpiazzare il viaggio. Vedi anche \"[Trucchi per le videoconferenze](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2-19)\" su come rimpiazzare le riunioni. \n\n**Quali sono i vantaggi della collaborazione asincrona, e come ottenerli**. Le conversazioni a distanza possono essere esperienze non altrettanto ricche e piacevoli quanto gli incontri di persona. Nonostante questo, altri aspetti della collaborazione distribuita posson compensare questi svantaggi, perch\u00e9 possono essere pi\u00f9 piacevoli di riunioni lunghe e spesso noiose. Nella nostra esperienza, le tecniche asincrone di comunicazione sono portatrici di libert\u00e0 che n\u00e9 le videochiamate n\u00e9 le riunioni possono darci. Puoi scegliere il tempo, il luogo e il ritmo del tuo lavoro; quando prenderti una pausa; e le interruzioni del tuo gatto o del tuo partner non sono affatto un problema, se non lo sono per te. Ci vorr\u00e0 un po' di tempo per trovare l'intesa giusta con i tuoi colleghi, perch\u00e9, per ora, queste competenze non vengono insegnate quasi da nessuno. Probabilmente hai gi\u00e0 tutti [gli strumenti](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--5) che ti servono: pi\u00f9 o meno un qualunque sistema di condivisione di archivi, una chat qualunque chat, un forum online qualunque vanno bene. Se ti occupi di sviluppo di prodotti, [anche un issue tracker pu\u00f2 essere utile](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--3-1). La cosa difficile, piuttosto, \u00e8 come usare questi strumenti in modo che sia tu che i tuoi colleghi apprezziate questo modo di lavorare. A questo punto, ti consigliamo di leggere \"Il segreto di una collaborazione distribuita piacevole\": comincia con una spiegazione delle dinamiche sociali degli ambienti digitali di lavoro sani, e di quelli orrendi. \u00c8 roba forte, ma non per scoraggiarti. E noi (Edgeryders) siamo ancora molto lontani dalla perfezione nel seguire l'approccio orientato ai valori che raccomandiamo a noi stessi e agli altri.\n\n**Primi passi con la collaborazione asincrona**. Il lavoro asincrono non \u00e8 piacevole \"di default\". Per renderlo tale, abbiamo raccolto le nostre esperienze migliori e le abbiamo condivise con te (capitoli \"[Comunicare](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2)\" e \"[Collaborare](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--3)\"). C'\u00e8 anche un capitolo su \"Socializzare\", dedicate alle pratiche rese all'interazione sociale sul lavoro, invece che all'efficienza. Consideralo uno starter kit, e sentiti libera di contribuire con i tuoi consigli. \n\nPrima di tuffarti in tutti i consigli e i trucchi, ricordati che le *best practices* hanno natura sociale. Non puoi rendere piacevole ed efficiente la *tua* esperienza di lavoro distribuito, ma solo quella *dei tuoi colleghi*, e viceversa. \n\nAlcune delle *best practices* sono un fatto di buon senso, come essere \"[Chiari, precisi, completi](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2-1)\" quando si comunica \u2013 e, naturalmente, non possiamo *non* comunicare. Altre pratiche sono meno intuitive, ma molto potenti: la combinazione di [comunicazione sistematica pull-based](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2-3), scegliere [nomi leggibili e sistematici per i files](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2-11), [evitare la ridondanza nei dati](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading-2-12) e [fare uno sforzo per immaginare](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263#heading--2-14) dove i tuoi colleghi cercheranno le informazioni che vuoi conservare \u00e8 un modo sicuro per rendere le cartelle condivise uno strumento piacevole da usare.\n\n**Livello Zen: un'organizzazione completamente distribuita**. I capitoli sulla comunicazione, la collaborazione e i gli strumenti mostrano come usare per la collaborazione distribuzione gli strumenti e i processi *esistenti*. Se hai il privilegio di avere controllo sulla tua organizzazione, puoi \u2013 e dovresti \u2013 spingerti oltre. Nel tempo, puoi modificare l'organizzazione in modo che il funzionamento distribuito sia nel DNA nell'organizzazione. In questo modo, gran parte degli attriti alla collaborazione spariranno da soli. In pi\u00f9, la tua organizzazione far\u00e0 parte dell'avanguardia: la nuova onda di organizzazioni adattate per un futuro a basse emissioni di carbonio. Potrete allora godere di benefici aggiuntivi, come l'efficienza nell'uso degli spazi fisici, riduzioni di costo, miglioramenti dell'equilibrio tra vita e lavoro e, s\u00ec, anche una maggiore resilienza rispetto a future epidemie.", "created_at": "2020-03-09 08:22:37.398304", "updated_at": "2020-03-09 16:16:28.347903", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1118, "wiki": true, "reads": 6, "score": 966.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54334, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10040, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"melancon, post:2, topic:10040\"]\nNow, the incoming and outgoing dependencies thing could also inspire another avenue to process the data\n[/quote]\n\n\nAgree. Furthermore, there is no need to have one viz to rule them all: you have complex data, so it makes sense to look at them from different perspectives. If I were using Realities for my org, I would like to know: which dependencies am I (most) vulnerable to? You can do this focusing on the dependency graph.

A recent environmental engineer graduate, I aim to travel the world. I am a new member here at Edgeryders. So, for my first post, I chose to write about Participatory Facilitation training that I attended almost a week ago. There, I got to meet one of the members of Edgeryders community. To talk about the training, it was a two-day program and one of the most fruitful programs I have attended ever. The training taught us how to conduct an interactive workshop mainly at a community level. One of the most effective tools for facilitation that I learnt about is mind mapping. It is a visual guide to any topic we know. For instance, we could take a big sheet and write the topic we want in the middle. Then it is time to subdivide the topic. More the use of images and colours, more soothing to the eyes and the mind. I would say this is one of the best ways to organize the ideas you have for a topic. Not only mind mapping, I learnt how energizers played a vital role in any lectures. The two-day training gave me a lifetime experience. I hope soon to use all the knowledge I gained so far in my field.\n\n\nThank you Edgeryders.

By\u0142am wychowywana w wierze katolickiej: z wierz\u0105c\u0105 i praktykuj\u0105c\u0105 mam\u0105 i wierz\u0105cym, niepraktykuj\u0105cym, antyklerykalnym ojcem. Chcia\u0142abym przekaza\u0107 dzieciom szacunek do drugiego cz\u0142owieka, wolno\u015b\u0107 rozumian\u0105 tak, \u017ce p\u00f3ki nikomu nie szkodzi, to mo\u017ce robi\u0107, co mu si\u0119 podoba; dop\u00f3ki jego zachowania nie wp\u0142ywaj\u0105 negatywnie na otoczenie, \u015brodowisko, ludzi, bliskich. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce nie ma obiektywnych aksjomat\u00f3w, na kt\u00f3rych mo\u017cna by si\u0119 oprze\u0107, niepodwa\u017calnych. Tylko cz\u0142owiek jest ich \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142em. Szuka\u0142abym bardziej warto\u015bci w cz\u0142owieku i w umowie spo\u0142ecznej ni\u017c w bogu. Wierz\u0119 w rozs\u0105dek ludzki, wy\u017csze warto\u015bci, kt\u00f3re cz\u0142owiek sam w sobie potrafi znale\u017a\u0107. Nie wiem z czego wyp\u0142ywa moralno\u015b\u0107. Nie mam autorytet\u00f3w. Za Kantem bym powiedzia\u0142a: \u201eNiebo gwia\u017adziste nade mn\u0105 i prawo moralne we mnie\u2026\u201d. To raczej umowa spo\u0142eczna, bo nie wszyscy s\u0105 katolikami. A czy s\u0105 obiektywne idee, plato\u0144skie warto\u015bci, w kt\u00f3re ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 te\u017c wierzy, nie wiadomo czy tak jest. Staram si\u0119 konfrontowa\u0107 swoje my\u015bli z otaczaj\u0105cymi mnie lud\u017ami: z rodzin\u0105, przyjaci\u00f3\u0142mi. Du\u017co do my\u015blenia daj\u0105 mi ksi\u0105\u017cki, kt\u00f3re czytam. Mam ulubionych pisarzy, ale nie wp\u0142ywaj\u0105 na moje postawy. Raczej s\u0105 autorytetami w sensie literackim.\n\nM\u00f3j partner pisze teraz prac\u0119 doktorsk\u0105 z kognitywistyki. Og\u00f3lnie, o umy\u015ble, jak postrzega, jak umys\u0142 podejmuje decyzje. Baza naukowa na ten temat m\u00f3wi, \u017ce tak naprawd\u0119 nasz umys\u0142 podejmuje decyzje tu i teraz. Nam si\u0119 wydaje, \u017ce wszystko mamy tak przemy\u015blane, rozpracowane, rozwalone na tysi\u0105c czynnik\u00f3w, a cz\u0119sto na powa\u017cne \u017cyciowe decyzje wp\u0142ywa np.: pogoda albo to, \u017ce ci\u0119 stanik uwiera. To wszystko tak p\u0142ynie jak rzeka, \u017ce zaczynasz czyta\u0107 i zastanawia\u0107 si\u0119 na ten temat: co ciebie konstytuuje jako cz\u0142owieka i jako osobowo\u015b\u0107. W\u0142a\u015bciwie przypadek decyduje o naszym \u017cyciu i losie. Okazuje si\u0119, \u017ce np.: to jak\u0105 mia\u0142am fryzur\u0119 zadecydowa\u0142o o tym kogo spotka\u0142am, dorastaj\u0105c. A potem siedzisz, gadasz, wynu\u017casz si\u0119 z odkryciami g\u0142\u0119bokimi: o moralno\u015bci i autorytetach moralnych, gdzie nie lada g\u0142owy si\u0119 nad tym \u0142ama\u0142y...\n\nJestem szcz\u0119\u015bliwie magistrem filozofii. Sko\u0144czy\u0142am te\u017c Uniwersytet Ludowy Rzemios\u0142a Artystycznego. Uczy\u0142am si\u0119 poza miastem, w kt\u00f3rym si\u0119 wychowa\u0142am, bo chcia\u0142am poszerzy\u0107 swoje horyzonty i dosta\u0107 si\u0119 na dobre studia \u2013 takie, na jakie chcia\u0142am. Tak si\u0119 sta\u0142o. Zawodowo zajmuj\u0119 si\u0119 rzemios\u0142em artystycznym. By\u0142am na dwuletnim kursie. Na pocz\u0105tku drugiego roku kursu odkry\u0142am wolontariat studencki. Ten wolontariat umo\u017cliwia\u0142 zakup sprz\u0119tu na w\u0142asno\u015b\u0107 w zamian za prowadzenie zaj\u0119\u0107 z danej dziedziny. W ten spos\u00f3b zdoby\u0142am baz\u0119 materia\u0142ow\u0105 i sprz\u0119tow\u0105. Przypadek chcia\u0142, \u017ce osoba, z kt\u00f3r\u0105 wtedy prowadzi\u0142am te warsztaty, jad\u0105c autostopem, pozna\u0142a kogo\u015b, kto szuka\u0142 ludzi do prowadzenia zaj\u0119\u0107 z rzemios\u0142a artystycznego w przedszkolach. Tak dostali\u015bmy pierwsz\u0105 prac\u0119 w przedszkolu. Tak pracowali\u015bmy oko\u0142o 2 lat. Potem za\u0142o\u017cyli\u015bmy swoj\u0105 firm\u0119. Prowadzili\u015bmy warsztaty z rzemios\u0142a i animacj\u0119. Prowdzili\u015bmy j\u0105 dwa lata. Potem koszty nas przeros\u0142y - du\u017cy ZUS. Po zamkni\u0119ciu firmy pracowali\u015bmy na w\u0142asn\u0105 r\u0119k\u0119. Je\u017adzili\u015bmy na jarmarki, bo nasze zainteresowania oscylowa\u0142y wok\u00f3\u0142 wyrobu ceramiki. Potem nasze drogi si\u0119 rozesz\u0142y. Znowu za\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am firm\u0119 i zamkn\u0119\u0142am po 2 latach z tych samych pwod\u00f3w. Potem pojawio si\u0119 dziecko i to utrudnia\u0142o bardzo rozkr\u0119cenie tej firmy. Zasz\u0142am w ci\u0105\u017c\u0119, kupilam samoch\u00f3d, za\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am firm\u0119. Wszystko w ci\u0105gu miesi\u0105ca. Wtedy by\u0142o tak, \u017ce partner nie pracowa\u0142, bo dostawa\u0142 stypendium doktoranckie i nie musieli\u015bmy si\u0119 stara\u0107 o pieni\u0105dze. Mieli\u015bmy gdzie mieszka\u0107. Co\u015b tam robi\u0142am. Zacz\u0119\u0142am prowadzi\u0107 zaj\u0119cia w domu kultury. Po zamkni\u0119ciu firmy dalej przez rok prowadzi\u0142am warsztaty. Jak zacz\u0119\u0142am si\u0119 anga\u017cowa\u0107 bardziej w zaj\u0119cia i warsztaty, zacz\u0119\u0142am je\u017adzi\u0107 z propozycjami, ulotkami pod koniec ubieg\u0142ego roku... To by\u0142o trudne, bo m\u00f3j tata chorowa\u0142, mama pracowa\u0142a, moja siostra by\u0142a za granic\u0105, by\u0142am w domu i prawie codziennie mu pomaga\u0142am, co bardzo mnie anga\u017cowa\u0142o, a partner by\u0142 w pracy praktycznie ca\u0142y dzie\u0144. Nie mia\u0142am mo\u017cliwo\u015bci zostawienia z kim\u015b syna, ale pracowa\u0142am w pracowni w domu, robi\u0142am swoje rzeczy. Nastawi\u0142am si\u0119 na bo\u017conarodzeniowe jarmarki. Stara\u0142am si\u0119 schodzi\u0107 do pracowni wieczorami. Po nocy tam pracowa\u0142am. Jeden dzie\u0144 partner mia\u0142 wolny, wi\u0119c tego dnia rozwozi\u0142am ulotki. Jak ju\u017c mi si\u0119 uda\u0142o zachachm\u0119ci\u0107 jakie\u015b warsztaty, to zmar\u0142 m\u00f3j tata \u2013 dzie\u0144 przed warsztatami. Trzy tygodnie po jego \u015bmierci okaza\u0142o si\u0119 te\u017c, \u017ce jestem w ci\u0105\u017cy. Wszystko si\u0119 na siebie na\u0142o\u017cy\u0142o. Zrezygnowa\u0142am z jarmark\u00f3w i z prowadzenia warsztat\u00f3w. Chcieli\u015bmy mie\u0107 drugie dziecko, ale nie planowali\u015bmy wtedy tego zrobi\u0107. Chcia\u0142am robi\u0107 jakie\u015b inne zaj\u0119cia, warsztaty na Wielkanoc. Zanios\u0142am ofert\u0119 warsztatow\u0105 do jednego, drugiego przedszkola. Nawet si\u0119 poumawia\u0142am, ale p\u00f3\u017aniej \u2013 w styczniu tego roku - okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce partnera mama ma t\u0119tniaka w m\u00f3zgu. Mia\u0142a operacj\u0119. Nie wiadomo by\u0142o czy prze\u017cyje i jak prze\u017cyje czy nie b\u0119dzie warzywem. Pojechali\u015bmy tam. Ona ma jeszcze tr\u00f3jk\u0119 dzieciak\u00f3w w wieku szkolnym. Pomaga\u0142am si\u0119 nimi opiekowa\u0107, bo zostawali sami. Trudna to by\u0142a dla nich sytuacja. Po czym okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce to by\u0142o jednak zbyt forsuj\u0105ce dla mnie, bo wyl\u0105dowa\u0142am w szpitalu z zagro\u017ceniem ci\u0105\u017cy. Dlatego zrezygnowa\u0142am z prowadzenia warsztat\u00f3w. Mia\u0142am miesi\u0119czn\u0105 przerw\u0119, bo drugi raz wyl\u0105dowa\u0142am w szpitalu przez zagro\u017cenie ci\u0105\u017cy. Poczu\u0142am si\u0119 lepiej i ograniczy\u0142am aktywno\u015b\u0107 do sko\u0144czenia programu zaj\u0119\u0107 w domu kultury. W tym czasie jeszcze partnera siostra wyl\u0105dowa\u0142a w szpitalu, jego dziadek mia\u0142 zagro\u017cenie \u017cycia. To by\u0142y mia\u017cd\u017c\u0105ce trzy miesi\u0105ce. Znowu wszystko mnie przyblokowa\u0142o z firm\u0105. Sko\u0144czy\u0142am cykl warsztat\u00f3w w domu kultury, ale teraz nie za bardzo ju\u017c mog\u0119 cokolwiek robi\u0107. Teraz z partnerem mamy taki plan, \u017ce od pa\u017adziernika do grudnia b\u0119dzie mi pomaga\u0107 i postawimy na moj\u0105 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107. B\u0119d\u0119 prowadzi\u0107 warsztaty, bo w okresie przed\u015bwi\u0105tecznym du\u017co os\u00f3b jest ch\u0119tnych i mo\u017ce w ko\u0144cu jarmarki mi si\u0119 udadz\u0105 po dwuletniej przerwie. S\u0105 takie pragnienia i marzenia z mojej strony, \u017ceby wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do zawodu. Mia\u0142am propozycj\u0119 prowadzenia warsztat\u00f3w w zak\u0142adzie aktywizacji zawodowej. Z\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am CV, ale miesi\u0105c wcze\u015bniej przyj\u0119li kogo\u015b innego. Nie wiadomo co z tego b\u0119dzie. Powiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce mog\u0142abym zacz\u0105\u0107 oko\u0142o pa\u017adziernika. Wygl\u0105dali na zainteresowanych. Zobaczymy. Warsztaty terapii zaj\u0119ciowej te\u017c pyta\u0142y czy chcia\u0142abym co\u015b tam robi\u0107 i zastanawia\u0142am si\u0119 nad tym. I dom kultury te\u017c, ale jak to wszystko b\u0119dzie, czy to wypali, czy b\u0119dziemy tu mieszka\u0107... Troch\u0119 nam si\u0119 tutaj nie chce mieszka\u0107, wi\u0119c zastanawiamy si\u0119 nad przeprowadzk\u0105. Tu jest dom do remontu, ale jak tu remontowa\u0107 i inwestowa\u0107 jak to nie jest twoje? Spadkobierc\u00f3w jest oko\u0142o 10. I tak musimy si\u0119 zastanowi\u0107 nad jakimi\u015b rozwi\u0105zaniami bardziej przysz\u0142o\u015bciowymi.\n\nPartner pracuje jako psycholog dzieci\u0119cy. W czerwcu sko\u0144czy\u0142 prac\u0119 w innym mie\u015bcie z osobami niepe\u0142nosprawnymi i jednocze\u015bnie pracowa\u0142 jako psycholog w interwencji kryzysowej. Jedna praca by\u0142a na p\u00f3\u0142 etatu, a druga - na 1/4 na najni\u017csz\u0105 krajow\u0105, z czego du\u017c\u0105 cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 pieni\u0119dzy poch\u0142ania\u0142y dojazdy, bo musia\u0142 codziennie doje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107. Teraz ma umow\u0119 zlecenie w projekcie unijnym. Ma przepracowa\u0107 ponad 300 godzin z dzieciakami z s\u0105siedniego powiatu. To nie jest *stricte* terapia, ale ma zdiagnozowa\u0107 problem i pomaga\u0107 im szuka\u0107 rozwi\u0105zania. Pi\u0119\u0107 godzin przeznaczyli na jedno dziecko. Dobra stawka godzinowa, ale zlecenie: ma okre\u015blon\u0105 liczb\u0119 godzin do wyrobienia. W naszym mie\u015bcie te\u017c mia\u0142 propozycj\u0119 z zak\u0142adu aktywizacji zawodowej: praca na podstawie zlecenia, 8 godzin tygodniowo, wynagrodzenie liczone jak 1/5 minimalnej krajowej. Gdyby to by\u0142a umowa o prac\u0119, nawet za tak\u0105 kas\u0119, pewnie by si\u0119 zdecydowa\u0142. Jak ma zarobi\u0107 400 z\u0142 tutaj, a pracuj\u0105c przy projekcie na zleceniu w innym mie\u015bcie w ci\u0105gu dnia zarobi tyle, to nie ma sensu. I ma jeszcze jakie\u015b stypendium socjalne, i jakie\u015b projako\u015bciowe w zwi\u0105zku z tym, \u017ce studiuje, ma wyniki. Do ko\u0144ca maja te\u017c wnosi\u0142am wk\u0142ad w nasz bud\u017cet.\n\nJestem ubezpieczona z dzie\u0107mi. Mam odprowadzane sk\u0142adki: zdrowotn\u0105, emerytaln\u0105 i rentow\u0105. By\u0142 taki projekt dla prowadz\u0105cych dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107. Je\u015bli urodzi\u0142a\u015b dziecko w trakcie prowadzenia dzia\u0142alno\u015bci, jeste\u015b ubezpieczona do momentu uko\u0144czenia przez dziecko 3 albo 5 lat, tak jakby\u015b za najni\u017csz\u0105 krajow\u0105 pracowa\u0142a. Za\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 w po\u0142owie maja 2016 roku, a w czerwcu zasz\u0142am w ci\u0105\u017c\u0119.\n\nJak wygl\u0105da\u0142 m\u00f3j dzie\u0144? Partner przyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142 z pracy, jedli\u015bmy obiad ok. 17:00. W tym czasie jeszcze karmi\u0142am. Ok. 18:00-19:00 schodzi\u0142am do pracowni. Siedzia\u0142am tam godzin\u0119 \u2013 dwie, bra\u0142am prysznic, przebiera\u0142am si\u0119, karmi\u0142am dziecko, czasem usypia\u0142am i schodzi\u0142am znowu do pracowni. Potem ubiera\u0142am si\u0119 w swoje ubrania robocze. Siedzia\u0142am tam w zale\u017cno\u015bci od tego ile mia\u0142am si\u0142y: do 22:00, 23:00, p\u00f3\u0142nocy. R\u00f3\u017cnie to bywa\u0142o. Partner jecha\u0142 z samego rana, zanim syn si\u0119 obudzi\u0142. Sz\u0142am po zakupy dla siebie i taty. Bra\u0142am dziecko ze sob\u0105. Wraca\u0142am do taty. Siedzia\u0142am z nim jaki\u015b czas - do ok. 11:00-12:00. K\u0142ad\u0142am dziecko spa\u0107, gotowa\u0142am obiad, sprz\u0105ta\u0142am, i znowu sz\u0142am do taty albo co\u015b robi\u0142am, np.: w sezonie czasem ogr\u00f3dek pieli\u0142am. P\u00f3\u017aniej wraca\u0142 partner, jedli\u015bmy obiad i schodzi\u0142am do pracowni itd. Czasem szli\u015bmy jeszcze do taty. Zale\u017cy czy chcia\u0142 i jak si\u0119 czu\u0142, a po po\u0142udniu wraca\u0142a mama. Du\u017c\u0105 cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 przedpo\u0142udnia sp\u0119dza\u0142am z synem i z tat\u0105. Potem byli\u015bmy u mamy partnera, \u017ceby opiekowa\u0107 si\u0119 jej dzie\u0107mi. Tylko, \u017ce partner wtedy pracowa\u0142 i ja by\u0142am z nimi sama. Partner przyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142 w czwartek i na weekend.\n\nOd pa\u0144stwa dostawali\u015bmy tylko 500 plus przez nieca\u0142y rok, a potem partner dosta\u0142 lepiej p\u0142atn\u0105 prac\u0119, te\u017c przy projekcie w Pu\u0142awach, i wypadali\u015bmy. Przekroczyli\u015bmy pr\u00f3g dochodowy, a potem sobie darowali\u015bmy. Teraz b\u0119dziemy sk\u0142ada\u0107. W naszym przypadku to b\u0119dzie ju\u017c 1 000 z\u0142 na dwoje dzieci, to jest zdecydowana poprawa dla naszego bud\u017cetu. Nie uwa\u017cam, \u017ceby to by\u0142o dobre rozwi\u0105zanie, \u017ce ka\u017cdy dostaje 500 plus, bo znam ludzi, kt\u00f3rzy maj\u0105 kilkana\u015bcie tysi\u0119cy i bior\u0105 jeszcze te dodatki. B\u0119d\u0105 sobie wydawa\u0107 na to, \u017ceby posiedzie\u0107 5 dni d\u0142u\u017cej w Hiszpanii. Ju\u017c mniejsza o to na co wydaj\u0105. My przez jaki\u015b okres sami zrezygnowali\u015bmy z tego, bo jeste\u015bmy minimalistami i nie potrzebujemy du\u017co. Wystarcza\u0142o nam z tego, co zarabiali\u015bmy. Chodzenie tam, sk\u0142adanie tych wszystkich dokument\u00f3w, grzebanie w \u017cyciorysach, przynoszenie um\u00f3w za 3 lata wstecz, t\u0142umaczenie si\u0119 ze wszystkiego itd... Ju\u017c sami si\u0119 w tym wszystkim zagubili\u015bmy. Nie chcia\u0142o nam si\u0119 tego robi\u0107, ale teraz z\u0142o\u017cymy. S\u0105 takie rodziny, jak np.: partnera mama, kt\u00f3ra sama wychowuje tr\u00f3jk\u0119 dzieci \u2013 wida\u0107, \u017ce jaki\u015b remont sobie zrobili, \u017ce na te zaj\u0119cia ich pozapisywa\u0142a. 500 plus nie jest dla mnie problemem czarnobia\u0142ym. Nie rozumiem te\u017c tego hejtu na te matki, co dostaj\u0105 500 plus i id\u0105 pod sklep si\u0119 napi\u0107. Tacy ludzie s\u0105, byli i b\u0119d\u0105, a my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 dobrze wykorzystuje te pieni\u0105dze. My\u015bl\u0119 te\u017c, \u017ce jaki\u015b pr\u00f3g dochodowy powinien by\u0107 wprowadzony. To inna rzecz, \u017ce czasami jest ta z\u0142ot\u00f3wka r\u00f3\u017cnicy i ju\u017c nie dostajesz. Nie wiem czy jeste\u015bmy na tyle bogatym pa\u0144stwem, \u017ceby dawa\u0107 hajs ludziom, kt\u00f3rych sta\u0107 na wszystko, ale nie wiem te\u017c jaki to ma by\u0107 pr\u00f3g. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce \u015brednio zarabiaj\u0105ce rodziny powinny dosta\u0107. My\u015bleli\u015bmy o przeprowadzce do innego miasta, kt\u00f3re nie jest drogie, ale gdyby\u015bmy oboje zarabiali tam minimaln\u0105 krajow\u0105, nie by\u0142oby nas sta\u0107 na \u017cycie. Do tego do\u0142\u00f3\u017c czynsz, z dw\u00f3jk\u0105 dzieci, naprawd\u0119 by\u0142oby nam trudno zwi\u0105za\u0107 koniec z ko\u0144cem. Jest tam jaka\u015b praca, ale w naszym przypadku praca na kasie w Biedronce czy w Lidlu, praca partnera na budowie, wi\u0119cej by\u015bmy zarabiali, ale czy o to chodzi w \u017cyciu, \u017ceby w wieku 50 lat nie m\u00f3c ju\u017c si\u0119 ruszy\u0107? Ten pr\u00f3g dochodowy musia\u0142by by\u0107 wy\u017cej postawiony. Ci\u0119\u017cko jest \u017cy\u0107 z dzie\u0107mi, ale przyjdzie ci ile\u015b os\u00f3b i powie, \u017ce \u201enikt ci nie kaza\u0142 dziecka rodzi\u0107\u201d. Albo: \u201ejak ci nie wystarcza, to zr\u00f3b sobie dziecko\u201d. Zale\u017cy kto ci to powie. Hejt jest z jednej i z drugiej strony. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce og\u00f3lnie to jest dobre. Chocia\u017c znam rodziny, gdzie maj\u0105 jedena\u015bcioro dzieci i dostaj\u0105 du\u017co pomocy finansowej z gminy, \u017cywno\u015bciowej z Unii Europejskiej. Nie chce im si\u0119 ry\u017cu gotowa\u0107 i wszystko to si\u0119 wala po podw\u00f3rku, a mieszkaj\u0105 wszyscy w dw\u00f3ch pokojach. Nie chce im si\u0119 remontowa\u0107 i siedz\u0105 sobie, browarka pij\u0105 pod domem. Nie wszyscy ludzie s\u0105 te\u017c gospodarni, ale nawet jak masz 500 z\u0142 na pi\u0119cioro dzieci, to w sumie 2 500 z\u0142, to wcale nie jest tak du\u017co miesi\u0119cznie. Nie da si\u0119 za to prze\u017cy\u0107. Jedzenie jest takie drogie. Wydasz 100 z\u0142 i nie masz za to zakup\u00f3w na trzy dni.\n\nMam du\u017ce do\u015bwiadczenie ze s\u0142u\u017cb\u0105 zdrowia. Mama i siostra partnera, m\u00f3j tata, i moje ci\u0105\u017ce. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce w naszej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia najs\u0142absz\u0105 strona jest SOR ( *przyp.: Szpitalny Oddzia\u0142 Ratunkowy* ). To, co tam si\u0119 dzieje, to jest... Jeden g\u0142\u00f3wny lekarz na zmianie i jednocze\u015bnie potrafi p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 na oddzia\u0142 i przeprowadza\u0107 operacj\u0119. Zostaje na dole niedycyzyjny rezydent i czeka na tamtego, \u017ceby ten co\u015b potwierdzi\u0142, a ludzie siedz\u0105 tam i czekaj\u0105 po kilkana\u015bcie godzin. Jest totalny chaos. Jeden ratownik medyczny, zak\u0142ada gips, rozwozi pacjent\u00f3w po oddzia\u0142aach, pomaga lekarzowi w papierologii, a 10 piel\u0119gniarek siedzi w kanciapie i sobie gada. Jest totalny brak organizacji; d\u0142ugie oczekiwanie pacjent\u00f3w... Zdecydowanie poprawi\u0142abym tam organizacj\u0119. Nie chodzi\u0142am prywatnie leczy\u0107 si\u0119 w czasie ci\u0105\u017cy, tylko na badanie USG ze wzgl\u0119du na to, \u017ce mam problem z dotrzymywaniem termin\u00f3w. Dostaj\u0119 skierowanie na badanie i zapominam um\u00f3wi\u0107 si\u0119 tego samego dnia na termin. Ale te\u017c obawiam si\u0119 brak\u00f3w w sprz\u0119cie, cho\u0107 nigdy tego nie do\u015bwiadczy\u0142am. Moja ginekolog daje mi skierowanie, bo u siebie w gabinecie co prawda ma aparat do USG, ale nie ma sprz\u0119tu do dok\u0142adnego badania wad rozwojowych. Jednocze\u015bnie to, \u017ce zap\u0142acisz za prywatn\u0105 wizyt\u0119, wcale nie oznacza, \u017ce ta porada b\u0119dzie kompatybilna z oczekiwaniami. A zapisanie si\u0119 do jakiegokolwiek specjalisty to jest dramat. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce w polskiej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia panuje niez\u0142a znieczulica na pacjenta. I na to mog\u0119 mno\u017cy\u0107 przyk\u0142ady. Partnera dziadka z zagro\u017ceniem \u017cycia trzy razy z SOR odsy\u0142ali do domu, nie chcieli go przyj\u0105\u0107 na oddzia\u0142. Jego mam\u0119 traktuj\u0105 jakby by\u0142a wariatk\u0105. Niekt\u00f3rzy maj\u0105 wyznaczone wizyty na 2025. O czym mowa? Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce jednak s\u0142u\u017cba zdrowia powinna by\u0107 cz\u0119\u015bciowo sprywatyzowana. Chocia\u017c prywatyzacja - tak jak w USA - \u017ce jak stracisz prac\u0119, nie masz umowy o prac\u0119 albo l\u0105dujesz na ulicy, nie ma dla nich \u017cadnej opieki zdrowotnej. Lekarzom si\u0119 nie chce, bo ma\u0142o zarabiaj\u0105 na oddziale. Oni zarabiaj\u0105 na prywantej praktyce. W Polsce to chyba zostaj\u0105 tylko specjali\u015bci, kt\u00f3rym nie chcia\u0142o si\u0119 uczy\u0107 na studiach albo ci, co zostaj\u0105 z wielkiego powo\u0142ania, jak misjonarze w Kambod\u017cy b\u0119d\u0105 ludzi ratowa\u0107. Chyba \u015brednio si\u0119 op\u0142aca pracowa\u0107 lekarzowi w pa\u0144stwowej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia? Maj\u0105 dy\u017cury po 12 godzin, potem jeszcze prywatnie. Kiedy oni maj\u0105 odpocz\u0105\u0107? Jak maj\u0105 tam funkcjonowa\u0107? System jest jaki\u015b wadliwy w Polsce i \u0142ap\u00f3wkarstwo. Spotka\u0142am si\u0119 z tym. S\u0105 dwa r\u00f3\u017cne podej\u015bcia. Mamy wujka w szpitalu, kt\u00f3ry jest lekarzem. Jak tata zacz\u0105\u0142 chorowa\u0107, co\u015b tam niby mia\u0142 mu za\u0142atwi\u0107 po znajomo\u015bci, skierowa\u0142 go do lekarki, kt\u00f3ra powiedzia\u0142a wprost, \u017ce jak wy\u0142o\u017cy dla niej hajs, b\u0119dzie mia\u0142 zapewnione wszystko \u2013 od tysi\u0105ca z\u0142otych wzwy\u017c. Na pa\u0144stwowej wizycie. Z kolei partera mama przed operacj\u0105|: jej mama martwi\u0142a si\u0119 i wsadzi\u0142a w kopert\u0119 ok. 1 000 z\u0142. Pop\u0119dzi\u0142a z kopert\u0105 do lekarza, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 operowa\u0107. Posz\u0142a do niego z t\u0105 \u0142ap\u00f3wk\u0105, a on powiedzia\u0142, \u017ce nie bierze \u017cadnych pieni\u0119dzy, \u017ce ewentualnie jak b\u0119dzie nadal chcia\u0142a, mo\u017ce mu da\u0107 po operacji. Ostatecznie zanios\u0142a mu ciasto. S\u0105 uczciwi lekarze, s\u0105 i tacy, i tacy. Od generalizacji jestem daleka. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce ludzie prowokuj\u0105 taki klimat, do czego lekarze si\u0119 przyzwyczajaj\u0105. W innym mie\u015bcie na SOR jest g\u0142\u00f3wny lekarz, w kitlu, z wystaj\u0105cym \u201egobelinem\u201d i ze srebrnym czy z\u0142otym \u0142a\u0144cuchem. Wygl\u0105da\u0142 jak gwiazda disco polo albo jak mafia pruszkowska z lat 90tych. A w gabinecie przyjmowa\u0142 rezydent. Wszystko tam robi\u0142. Byli\u015bmy tam, bo syn przyci\u0105\u0142 sobie palca w samochodzie i my\u015bleli\u015bmy, \u017ce to z\u0142amanie. Sam wszystko robi\u0142. Nie by\u0142o ratownika ani piel\u0119gniarki. A lekarz prowadz\u0105cy, normalnie, na SOR, w pa\u0144stwowej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia, przyjmowa\u0142 pacjent\u00f3w poza kolejno\u015bci\u0105 za dodatkow\u0105 op\u0142at\u0105. W og\u00f3le si\u0119 z tym nie kry\u0142. G\u0142\u00f3wny lekarz, ratownik i piel\u0119gniarka przyszli do gabinetu, gdzie by\u0142 tylko rezydent, dopiero jak dw\u00f3ch policjant\u00f3w przyprowadzi\u0142o osadzonego ( *przyp. wi\u0119zie\u0144* ).\n\nZdarza si\u0119, \u017ce g\u0142osuj\u0119, w zale\u017cno\u015bci od tego czy tu jestem i czy mam czas. Zdarza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce bra\u0142am za\u015bwiadczenie albo nie g\u0142osowa\u0142am \u2013 jak ostatnio - bo \u017ale si\u0119 czulam. Og\u00f3lnie staram si\u0119 g\u0142osowa\u0107. G\u0142osuj\u0119 na cz\u0142owieka, nie na parti\u0119. Bywa, \u017ce partia ma znaczenie. Co o tym decyduje? Do \u017cadnej partii nie jest mi blisko. To jest masakra. Naprawd\u0119 nie ma na kogo zag\u0142osowa\u0107. Troch\u0119 mam sprany m\u00f3zg przez to macierzy\u0144stwo i ci\u0105\u017c\u0119. Gdy docieraj\u0105 do mnie informacje jak to wszystko wygl\u0105da, jak si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3c\u0105 z jednej i z drugiej strony, ile jest hejtu, ile jest nienawi\u015bci wobec siebie, to zniech\u0119ca mnie to na maksa, \u017ceby zainteresowa\u0107 si\u0119 tym powa\u017cnie, zbada\u0107 to. Strona medialna to jest jakie\u015b oszo\u0142omstwo totalne, z jednej i z drugiej strony, tam nie ma \u017cadnych informacji. W sumie z internetu korzystam czasami. Mam subskrybowane strony, jak Wolne Media czy Infopigu\u0142a. Oni nie s\u0105 za ani za jednymi ani za drugimi. Przedstawiaj\u0105 fakty. Czasem jest tak nakr\u0119cana ta spirala nienawi\u015bci na PIS, \u017ce podaje si\u0119 do wiadomo\u015bci publicznej fakty, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 tylko pom\u00f3wieniami. Ludzie p\u00f3\u017aniej to \u0142ykaj\u0105 jak pelikany, je\u015bli to podejdzie pod ich \u015bwiatopogl\u0105d. Zero krytycyzmu na temat informacji, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 w wiadomo\u015bciach. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce wiele os\u00f3b tak ma i to jest problem. Mam z deka prawicowe pogl\u0105dy pod k\u0105tem pa\u0144stwowym i gospodarczym. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce w interesie Polak\u00f3w jako ludzi zamieszkuj\u0105ych ten wyznaczony na mapie teren jest to, \u017ceby jednak polityka gospodarcza i zagraniczna by\u0142a narodowa, bo to wymusza polityka wszystkich pa\u0144stw w Europie. Ka\u017cdy pilnuje swojego interesu. Tr\u00f3jk\u0105t Wyszehradzki to nie jest taki g\u0142upi pomys\u0142. Pod tym wzgl\u0119dem powinni\u015bmy i\u015b\u0107 bardziej narodowo. Spo\u0142eczne pogl\u0105dy jednak mam bardziej liberalne, a liberalizm to te\u017c jest kapitalizm, taki krwio\u017cerczy, przez co nie wydaje mi si\u0119 to takie dobre, dlatego te\u017c mam pogl\u0105dy socjalistyczne. Pod k\u0105tem prawa do aborcji, zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w partnerskich, w tym homoseksualnych, czy podej\u015bcie do przyrody, kt\u00f3re PIS ma, to jest jakie\u015b... Problem tej partii wydaje mi si\u0119 jest taki, \u017ce tam nie ma jakich\u015b zdrowomy\u015bl\u0105cych ludzi. Pod k\u0105tem kultury - jak przeczyta\u0142am o nowym dyrektorze instytucji w O. - to jakby przenie\u015b\u0107 gbura i wsadzi\u0107 do najwi\u0119kszej jednostki kulturalnej w wojew\u00f3dztwie, bo oni chyba nie maj\u0105 kadr. Przed tymi wszystkimi aferami, kilka lat temu, jedyn\u0105 zmaz\u0105 na wizerunku PIS by\u0142a dla mnie katastrofa smole\u0144ska, ale sk\u0142ania\u0142am si\u0119 bardziej do nich ni\u017c do PO ( *przyp.: Platforma Obywatelska* ). Je\u017celi chodzi o gospodark\u0119 mieli bardziej pronarodowe podej\u015bcie. Ale to, co teraz si\u0119 dzieje - p\u0142ac\u0105 miliardy, \u017ceby ameryka\u0144scy \u017co\u0142nierze stacjonowali na wschodniej granicy i \u0107wiczyli ewakucj\u0119 do Niemiec. S\u0142abo to teraz wszystko wygl\u0105da. Kaczy\u0144ski by\u0142 kiedy\u015b bardziej... Nie wiem... Nie ma kultury politycznej w tym kraju.\n\nNajwi\u0119kszy problem dla mnie to czy nie p\u0119knie mi macica. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce to wszystko ju\u017c by\u0142o. To doprowadzi\u0142o do rozbior\u00f3w. Narobi\u0142o si\u0119 mn\u00f3stwo partii, ka\u017cdy ci\u0105gnie w swoj\u0105 stron\u0119. Nie ma merytorycznej dyskusji, tylko jeden wielki krzyk. Jedni na drugich napierdzielaj\u0105, i to niezale\u017cnie czy to s\u0105 ci tolerancyjni lewicowcy czy to s\u0105 ci wykszta\u0142ceni historycy z prawicy. Wszyscy zagubili si\u0119 w jednym wielkim hejcie, co tylko os\u0142abia kraj na arenie mi\u0119dzynarodowej. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce nied\u0142ugo b\u0119dzie wojna i \u017ce Polska znowu dostanie po dupie za takie zachowanie. Bo zamiat budowa\u0107 silny front z Litw\u0105, \u0141otw\u0105, Estoni\u0105, W\u0119grami, Czechami, S\u0142owacj\u0105...

An economy\u2019s inaction based on its certainties is creating a global deadlock. Permanent micro-adjustments are no longer enough. Fortunately, intellectuals on all sides reject the status quo and imagine more desirable futures. Among them, science fiction authors are now proposing radically new models and shaking up the established order.\n\nTo highlight the synergies between SF and the economy, the Edgeryders community supported by EIT Climate-KIC is organising a major day of debates, workshops and celebrations open to all.\n\nTake part in a large workshop. (14h30 - 16h30) Extinction Rebellion is joining forces with the Sci-Fi Economics Lab to discuss and create positive progress.\n\nDiscuss with figures from SF and the economy. (18h - 20h) Science fiction author Cory Doctorow will respond to a renowned economist in a major debate.\n\nMeet with academics to brainstorm topics for academic articles to be published in 2020 (next day at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics & Management.\n\nBy contributing to this crowdfunding campaign you do two things: \n\n1) **Make the Science Fiction Economics Lab possible**  - We need your support to help cover the costs of organising this year's edition.

We strongly believe that Monastir NEEDED that kind of projects, that would raise the citizens awareness of the environmental problems, and presenting biking as a very cool and attractive alternative to cars to use, especially when going to schools/universities, hanging out with friends, doing shopping etc.. Through the market study that we have conducted, it was obvious that the early adopters for this projects would be the youth aged between 14 years old and 28 years old, and it made sense as biking was related, in older people mindset, to certain social class and symbol of poverty, making it even harder to change the laws and convince authorities to invest more in cycling infrastructure. So the idea was to bring together the early adopters and through them to spread the idea that biking is actually COOL, HEALTHY, FUNNY, CLASSY and, even though most people don't see it for now, ECO-FRIENDLY. We managed to do that through several successful biking events. Local media, looking for new adventures in the city to share and talk about, were of a great support also!\n We did not stop there, but we went convincing the city mayor, the governor and other authorities to support  our events, and that it is a must not a luxury, to promote tourism and animate the city, and we succeeded in getting some very small financial support but that was great for us because we saw it as an opening for bigger support and adoption of the project and the biking culture in the future. We always insisted to invite their kids to our events, and made sure that they enjoy them. It was our way to ensure the officials would attend and see and get on board to support this new movement.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6fd753489500f7676d7c32fd367ccd73aabf6557.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">   \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/59163d13400168dbc6cc6a595f0b37811cdd6f2f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nNowadays, we there is three renting bikes agencies. You start to see many people, especially the youth hanging out on bikes in groups. It is true that no regulation or public investment were put in place to promote biking, but I think it is more important more people adhere to biking and the movement keep growing, after all it is the people who change the regulations and impose investment not the other way around. \nI wish you good luck in your venture, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions, I would be glad to help :)", "created_at": "2017-09-09 11:37:56.726324", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 11:37:56.726324", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 520, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 147.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43435, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8398, "post_number": 10, "raw": "@bembo_davies :slight_smile:  tu as toujours le pouvoir de me surprendre :smile:", "created_at": "2018-03-30 08:07:19.665428", "updated_at": "2018-03-30 08:07:19.665428", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43432], "is_liked_by": [4357], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74354, "user_id": 5485, "topic_id": 13213, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Jack-Hardinges|300x300](upload://oTDTixm0rchs3TxpVVCXb87Ic23.jpeg) Jack is Programme Lead for Data Institutions at the Open Data Institute, where he explores different approaches to data stewardship.", "created_at": "2020-04-15 08:56:54.963136", "updated_at": "2020-04-15 08:56:54.963136", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78028, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13748, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<hr>\n\n# Functionality and Styling for Webkit Form elements \n<hr>\n\n**Github repos:** key ones are the one for \n* freelancers.edgeryders.eu\n* registration.edgeryders.eu \n* listen.edgeryders.eu\n* https://covid19-summit.netlify.app\n\n**Other useful repositories:** add here *(e.g the illustrations repo used by @owen : you had a place where you pick up most of the illustrations I think?

Markup in a Discourse topic that is the established standard of configuration for a form.\n2. A site to display & answer user created forms.\n3. A \u2018configuration wizard\u2019 to easily create (or edit) a form for any non technical user\n4. Each form can be referenced and displayed on any webkit site.\n5. Each form can create an account or use an existing account to post the response.\n\n### State of completion of the feature - development\nFeature 1: done, requires documentation\nFeature 2: not done, estimated level of difficulty/ time requirement is - \nFeature 3: requires the post to Discourse feature to work (feature 5).\nFeature 4: done, requires documentation\nFeature 5: is being worked on by @nirgal.\n\n### Remaining work: Tech development\n**What we have now:**\n* A form component that reads from a configuration topic that can be hosted and edited on Discourse\n* It creates an account (yet to be tested)\n*  It posts a topic to Discourse (yet to be tested)\n\n**What is being worked on right now:**\n\n*  Logging in existing user\n* Posting to an existing topic / category\n* Testing all use cases \n\n**What remains to be done:**\n* Production of configuration wizard: to easily create (or edit) a form for any non technical user\n* Input components from freelance form \n* Layouts:\n   * Full page with slides\n    * Standard view\n * Clear markup for configuring and styling\n* Reference a form by topic ID => reuse on different sites and layouts.\n* We need the script James wrote to be able to update existing topics (in order to get the wizard to work).\n\n### Remaining work: Production of (NON TECHNICAL) manual for event organisers\n* We want to get to:  \u2018configuration wizard\u2019 to easily create (or edit) a form for any non technical user\n* To get this wizard to work we need the script James wrote to be able to update existing topics.\n\n#### FAQs from event organisaters:\n\n1.

Never came across this so far for whatever reason \u2026\n\nAbout containers, it's somewhat of a sensitive issue for me :smile: Installing and deploying software to Windows was always a mess and I don't care. But I still think that the free software world got severely unhinged when, 10-15 years ago, people started to (1) create their own special purpose package management systems, from browser extensions to source package systems like NPM, Gem etc. and (2) also they created too many Linux distributions and (3) they never took up packages as the means to distribute serverside web applications (with a few exceptions). Before, there was `.deb` and `.rpm` as a de-facto standard, and when you made these packages for your stuff, you were done. But now, packages were no longer the standard single-command way of deploying everything. And since nobody had the time to do all the manual installation work, the idea of distributeable containers was born. The worst hack ever, in my view. But yea, let's have a postpandemic fireside chat :) \n\nSpecifically about Ruby deployment, I feel the temptation of using containers too. Such a mess when you need different rubies and different bundler, Rails and gem versions on the same host. I tried multiple solutions but now am mostly happy with [`chruby`](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby).

They use the GraphQL syntax to expose a RDF store: https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley/blob/master/docs/GraphQL.md\n\n##How I understand GraphQL's role for integration\n\n* I looked at the code in [realities/.../api/src/index.js](https://github.com/theborderland/realities/blob/master/api/src/index.js) and get the idea how to use GraphQL to get data. \n* The identification of things in GraphQL is always relative to the API you are using: if you want to know \"what is the Name of Dream #123\", you query like {dream (id:\"123){name}}. \n* There is no global ID scheme, I understand this is by design: https://graphql.github.io/learn/caching/\n* Data from different sources cannot be combined by design. Rather, you query one source after another. To get the GPS Position of Dream #123, you would query another service and go for something like {gpspositions (id:\"123\", type:\"Dream\"){lat lon}}\n\n##How I understand Linked Data for integration\nIn Linked Open Data it would work differently\n\n* The ID of the dream would be its URI: http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349\n* The core data the dream platform knows about this dream would be expressed as RDF, for example as \"creative work\" from schema.org. Example in JSON-LD `{\n  \"@id\": \"http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349\",\n  \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\",\n  \"author\": \"Salon Leobard\",\n  \"image\": \"http://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images.dreams.borderland/images/attachments/000/001/342/large/5.jpg?1525040826\",\n  \"name\": \"Hammock Reactor\"\n}`\n* The dreams platform can publish this data in different ways. You would chose the way that is most easy to implement and also to parse the data later. I list some of the ways I think are useful:\n * a) use the ontola-rdf-serializer for Rails that lets you expose your Ruby Objects as RDF: https://github.com/ontola/rdf-serializers . This builds on top of https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers. It was recommended to me today by Thom van Kalkeren over at https://gitter.im/linkeddata/chat\n * b) Embed the [JSON inside the HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/#embedding-json-ld-in-html-documents) of the Dreams page.\n * c) Return the JSON as separate document/URI (example: http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349.json) and refer to this URI from the dreams page using a link from the HEAD, such as `<link rel=\"meta\" type=\"application/ld+json\" href=\"/dreams/349.json\"/>`.\n * d) Provide a data-dump of all dreams at http://dreams.theborderland.se/alldata.json . This could point to a service that dumps all data as one big RDF stream (file).\n* In theory, there are tons of more ways how to serve RDF, but these four are the ones I think are most realistic to use in our scenario. a) may be easy to implement. b) and c) would be typical ways how people publish linked data so that search engines (google, ...) can find them. d) is a typical hack that goes a long way.\n* The realities platform could access the linked data in two ways: on demand or indexed.\n * On demand: The realities just knows that it can HTTP-get http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349.json and know that it is linked data. Whenever needed, it HTTP-Gets the JSON and renders the parts it needs.\n * Indexed: Realities gets the http://dreams.theborderland.se/alldata.json regularily (for example, daily, there won't be many changes on dreams) and stores it into a SPARQL Database.\n* In the \"indexed\" case, the fact that globally unique IDs are used comes into play: The SPARQL database can store tons of RDF data in just one big RDF database without any configuration. You just dump one file after another into the database. As all files reference globally unique IDS (URIs) the graph automatically builds itself and fills itself with data. \n\n## Adding more applications (with Linked Data)\nThe interesting part starts, when more applications come into play, then Linked Data has more meaning:\n\n* Lets go further: There is a \"Google Maps Application\", which may manage the GPS position of the Dream. That would be (in JSON-LD): `{\"@id\": \"http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349\", \"@context\": \"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#\", \"lat\": 55.6154473, \"long\": 12.1574238}`. Again, this data would be available, together with all other positions of all other things you can have on the playa, in a file served from somewhere, lets say http://myplacementapp.com/borderland/placement.json\n* In the \"indexed\" case, you would know that all placement data is from there and you would also retrieve this data and store it into your SPARQL Store. \n* Now you could query your SPARQL with queries such as `SELECT ?r ?p ?o WHERE {<http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349> ?p ?o.}`. The result of this query would return the data from both the dreams platform and the map - combined. The patterns in this query stand for \"?subject ?predicate ?object\". Its comparable to \"key value\" in Json. The differences are that in linked data, keys and values are always attached to a subject they talk about, identified by a URI; and that the values are called \"object\" as they can be subjects themselves elsewhere or simple data values.\n* In Ruby, you could for example use https://github.com/ruby-rdf/sparql-client to read/write data to a SPARQL store\n* The power of LinkedData is that you use globally unique IDs to identify resources across systems - you can easily combine two systems if they \"link to each other's data\" in the first place. We saw this in the example of the \"Google Maps Application\" that already referenced the Dream by its URI. It was clear that it places things that come from another webpage. The \"google maps application\" could be used to place anything - not only dreams. You would go into the application and it would ask you \"what do you want to place? please enter the URI here\". After entering the URI, such as http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/349, the placement app would use the above methods (a,b,c) to find out what this is and then say \"ah, ok, I got some JSON-LD, you want to place a CreativeWork with name \"Hammock Reactor\". \n* The same with the data. Each app can use its own data \"scheme\", and again the ID of the properties is global. So while the dreams platform would use schema.org to state name, author, image, the placement/maps app would use GEO-Scheme to express latitude and longitude. The RDF store stores the data internally with the keys being the full URIs (i.e. http://schema.org/author, http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#lat) So even if both apps define a \"name\", if they use different schemas, both names would be stored and would be queryable.\n* This design allows you to connect various systems before you even know what systems they are going to be. And connect various data formats before you know what exactly they are going to be.\n\n## ... if you consider RDF Storage to index data\nNow if you want to build a large index, you would need an RDF database. The SPARQL databases are interesting thingies. \n\n* I can recommend [Apache JENA/Joseki Server](http://jena.apache.org/), it is simple and works\n* I can recommend [OpenRDF/rdf4j/Sesame](http://rdf4j.org/), it is a bit more powerful and also works. There is an interesting high-performance backend (http://marmotta.apache.org/kiwi/). \n* I also find [CayLey](https://cayley.io/) looks pretty cool and works on top of SQL/NOSQL databases, which would be a good idea for backup/data safety. \n* Virtuoso is another store that is complex, powerful, but a beast to get started and to tame.\n\nIn all cases: use SPARQL to query.\n\n## Comparison\n\nI think the key difference is that RDF is built for heterogeneous systems where multiple apps are going to publish/consume data and new apps can \"join\" anytime later. With GraphQL you would rather connect two systems for a specific purpose.\n\nThat makes the RDF apis slower to realize in the first place as you would have to decide which method you are going to use to publish the data, maybe also taking into account what client libraries you have for RDF. Compared to GraphQL, where you do not have to make so many decisions: you just have one single method how to publish the data - the GraphQL endpoint. \n\nAnother difference is combining data:\n\n* With GraphQL, you cannot just Dump the JSON from two different services into the same database and combine it, the Keys would clash and the data probably. GraphQL is made to be consumed by the GUI and presented.\n* With RDF, you could load multiple data sources and then query it as one.\n\n## What I think a wise developer for #realities could consider \n\nIf we look at the use cases I pointed out in the video, I would go for the following recommendation based on technical aspects:\n\n* For clear & easy APIs, use GraphQL. You have mapping frameworks you can plug on top of Ruby to expose your data model as GraphQL. You are good at consuming GraphQL. You will be quick and you will get results that work for you. You already made the decision to use React/GraphQL.\n* For data from one app included into another app: GraphQL.\n* To change data from another app: GraphQL.\n* For apps that talk about data from OTHER apps (such as \"this mapping app is needed to place things on a map which are actually created/represented within other apps\"), referencing to entities from other Apps using URIs would be a start.\n* If a big data dump is to be exposed by one app and consumed by another: Exchanging Data between Apps using linked data could be then considered.\n* For a big unifying read-only database where data from many apps is to be indexed to find out \"all we know about this dream\", a SPARQL store and linked data could be interesting. The open question would be how to \"crawl\" the data and get it into the store, option d) from above would make it easy and this is a way many linked data apps work today. Google crawls both individual pages and sucks RDF out of them and also tries to get dumps. Another question would be when to crawl (regularly or - if we know when data changes - on demand). I could ask some people about that, if needed.\n\nSocial / Human aspects\n\n* You know GraphQL already. Developer support is better for GraphQL as it is a \"trendy\" framework, you will find tons of info. To quickly get useful, working stuff done within hours, GraphQL is probably the better choice for you.\n* LinkedData has been around since 1998 and it is heavily used by the search engines (Google) and for marking up data all over the web. But many of the tutorials you google online are outdated (as it has 20 years of history) and finding the \"2018\" stuff is trickier. You find a lot more sources about RDF, but its harder to decide what is useful and what not.\n\n\n\n(sorry for the late reply, I hope it's still in time)", "created_at": "2018-10-19 19:40:48.368462", "updated_at": "2018-10-21 10:53:50.597464", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1923, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 363.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35882, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 6892, "post_number": 27, "raw": "Yes, I have already started working on proper plan related to everything.

Since we don't have massive amounts of external traffic like Wikipedia, we'd mostly hurt ourselves instead of raising attention :( \n\n\n### (4) Don't implement\n\nIn my personal opinion that's the only thing that would help: civil disobedience, just not following this nonsense if it becomes law. Apart from the fact that there is no practical solution for upload filters, an institution passing such a nonsense has lost all moral authority \u2013 at least when it comes to regulating our Internet. As the admin of edgeryders.eu, I won't do a single hour of work to implement \"upload filters\".

Someone from Facebook was there, and he recommended \"a motion element in everything you do\". So, for example, it is no longer enough to have a background image to your Facebook page; you should have a background _video_, or GIF, or something. The paradox: we were discussing a project meant to inform citizens, and prompt them to take action on doing things like appeals to the European Ombusdman, or launch European Citizen Initiatives. So, on the one hand you are requiring a super-high degree of civic spirit, motivation and idealism from people; on the other hand you are saying that they need shiny visuals to act. They are treated as philosopher-kings in one sentence, and as desire machines in the next one.  \n\nMy main input to that session was \"reflect on how online marketing has become the default metaphor for all types of human interaction\".

As well as run great communication campaigns to help us ensure that they reach and engage their intended audience(s). This will include refining the concepts of the calls, finding and reaching out to speakers,shaping the presentation etc. But the priority is on getting it done well and on time.\n\nThe person taking on this role would be supported by a team of experienced community managers, a tech crew (front end dev and some backend) as well as the people managing the various activities. They would have access to a budget to engage freelance communication professionals such as copywriters, graphic designers etc. \n\nThe background to this work is that there are different teams running different activities of which the webinars are a part. Each has its own thematic focus and set of objectives. What they all have in common is that they are aimed at improving our ability to collectively respond to the ongoing pandemic crises, as well as to future ones. \n\n**Process:**\n* Themes are set by the Edgeryders community managers (see below) \n* Webinar topics are proposed in a wiki: https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-community-call-schedule-proposals-wishlist/13044\n* Only ones that have a crew willing to do a significant part of the work are then picked up and developed, then promoted.\n\n## Themes and topics*\nThere are two main questions that we are looking to answer\n\n* What policies in EU are needed to support the evolution of technology so that it contributes towards  healthy societies *everywhere*? \n* How do we build constructive, inclusive political movements that effectively advocate for the wellbeing of *all* humans + the ecological systems that support us?\n\nThe topics that we are especially interested in exploring:\n*  Health care (matched to Covid19)\n*  Work/ Labour\n*  Acts of Kindness and Solidarity\n*  Mental Health\n*  Migration\n*  Resilience and wellbeing (focus on climate & ecology)\n\n\nThe larger overarching themes that will frame our enquiries are:\n* **Learning from the Past, Taking Notes for the Future:**  What are we learning from this crisis that informs how we\u2019re thinking about responding to other crises, like global climate change?\n* **Work/Labour:**  How has our work been affected and how have our day to day lives changed? What tools or practices have we used to cope? How can we collaboratively create new income opportunities?\n* **Acts of Kindness and Solidarity** : What do we need to do to help each other get through?\n* **Mental Health and Surviving Boredom:**  What are we doing to cope with our social day-to-day lives \u2026boredom \u2026anxiety?\n* **Digital Communication:**  What has changed under social distancing? What tools have we used to stay in touch, and how has it felt to use them \u2014 how have our relationships changed or been mediated differently?\n* **Technology before and after**  What technologies are were talking about now vs a month ago? What do we now relate to topics like \" innovation\" or new technologies like artificial intelligence? What hopes or doubts do we have about their potential? What fears do we have?\n\n## Production responsibilities\n\n* Set up a shared webinars calendar including all the agreed on topics for the upcoming two months. Changes can be operated depending on new developments.\n* Produce text and visual communication 3 weeks in advance for each webinar. This includes calls for participation, digital flyers featuring the speakers and topics, and related topic materials.\n* Create a registration funnel / page for each webinar \n* Ensure there is a shared mailing list with all particpants\n* Launch email campaigns and send reminders ahead of each webinar\n* Optional: facilitate the webinar sessions\n* Provide documentation with highlights from the session on edgeryders.eu\n* Launch email campaign to follow up on each session and deepen the conversation and documentation.  \n\n## Terms \n\nThe person will be hired as a service provider contract and engaged for six months, from April to September 2020, for an estimate of 1-2 days a week, for an estimate of 2-3 webinars per month. \nA mid term evaluation will take place after the first three months.\n\nRemuneration will be agreed on based on mutually convened deliverables at the contract negotiation phase following this call. The reason for this is that we are aware of different skill levels, hourly rate and time constraints that candidates might have, and wish to be able to accommodate that.\n\n## How to apply\nEmail kaja@edgeryders.eu with \"Web producer\" in subject header.", "created_at": "2020-04-07 06:52:15.576946", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 06:27:47.071466", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 742, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 124.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55230, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10130, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Guys since this is taking a bit too long lets simplify it? https://edgeryders.eu/t/organiser-bios/10161/2", "created_at": "2019-06-15 17:10:49.944381", "updated_at": "2019-06-15 17:10:49.944381", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55226], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66619, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12063, "post_number": 7, "raw": "The work:\n\n1.

Graphryder Dashboards](#heading--5-4)\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Usage</h2>\n\nAll our Graphryder Dashboards can be publicly accessed using URLs of this scheme:\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/{corpusname}\n```\n\nCurrently we have Dashboards installed for the following corpora:\n\n* project NGI Forward: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi\n* project OpenCare: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/opencare\n* project OpenVillage: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/openvillage\n* project POPREBEL: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/poprebel\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Software architecture</h2>\n\n**Components.** Graphryder (\"GR\") consists of two separate components: a backend / server component called [Graphryder API](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api) and a frontend called [Graphryder Dashboard](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-dashboard). The API includes a Neo4j database (\"GR Database\"). Here are their roles:\n\n* **GR Dashboard** does all its work in the browser on your machine. It's a JavaScript application loaded as a static site, runs on your machine, and loads data from GR API. It's built completely in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It uses a whole range of libraries, which are all front-loaded when you load the client in your browser. GR Dashboard only talks to GR API, which in turn talks to GR Database.\n\n* **GR API** is built in Python and does the heavy lifting to generate data for GR Dashboard. In addition to Python, it has quite a lot of Cypher queries, sent to GR Database using the Python Neo4j interface library. It also contains Tulip libraries, used to generate the graphs. GR API is also responsible for filling the GR Database with data from Discourse in the first place. In fact, anyone can trigger it to re-fill the GR Database contents with the latest data from Discourse by simply calling the `/hardUpdateFromEdgeRydersDiscourse` GR API route from their browser.\n\n* **GR Database** is just a Neo4j database that caches data obtained from Discourse (namely, from [Open Ethnographer](/t/6811), a piece of software we added to Discourse). Here is a query result that demonstrates the data structure. Some of the results have been removed from the graph for clarity.\n\n    ![26|690x330](upload://wKwwt9V18f83QmYnoVolh8OgGU.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Data flow.** The flow of data inside Graphryder is as follows:\n\n* **For primary data:** When GR Dashboard is launched it starts by downloading a lot of data from GR API, including [every single post](http://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi/api/posts) and [every user](http://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi/api/users) and [every tag](http://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi/api/tags) in the corpus, as well as some other data. GR API generates these JSON files from data it obtains from its GR Database on demand, at the time GR Dashboard is loaded in a browser. So these JSON files are not cached by GR API but freshly built every time, from data that it caches in the GR Database.\n\n* **For graph data:** GR Dashboard also receives JSON data from GR API that describes Tulip-generated graphs. For an example of how this data looks, [see here](https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi/api/draw/usersToUsers/FM%5E3%20(OGDF)).In contrast to the posts, users, and tags, the JSON data containing the graphs is not front-loaded into GR Dashboard. Instead, these are loaded on-demand from GR API when the user loads a new graph in GR Dashboard.\n\n    GR API keeps Tulip files (`.tlp`) for all graphs available pre-built and cached in `./data/tlp/` (by default; else see `tlp_path` in `config.ini`). It then converts them to the required JSON format in the required layout when requested from GR Dashboard ([code ref](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/blob/2e0def8/routes/tulipr/tulip_layout.py#L20)).\n\n    The Tulip (`.tlp`) files cached in GR API can be re-built from inside GR Dashboard by clicking on the top-right gear icon and using the buttons in the settings sidebar. Clicking these buttons has no effect on the GR Database, it only triggers a rebuild of the Tulip graph files using the data in GR Database at the time.\n\n    When (re-)building these Tulip files, GR API employs algorithms from its included [Tulip Python libraries](https://tulip.labri.fr/Documentation/current/tulip-python/html/).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Installation</h2>\n\nThese are instructions for setting up Graphryder from scratch for a new ethnographic corpus (the conversation to analyze) and ethnographic codes. Your mileage may vary depending on your server environment. \n\nThese instructions apply to Debian / Ubuntu based systems and so far have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 19.04. For other distributions, you may have to adapt some steps. As for hardware requirements: Neo4j, Graphryder API and Graphryder Dashboard run together on a DigitalOcean droplet with 8 GiB of main memory.\n\nSeveral instances set up using these instructions are available at `graphryder.edgeryders.eu` as a reference; for the URLs see section \"[1. Usage](#heading--1)\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Graphryder API</h3>\n\n\n#### 1. Install Neo4j\n\n1. If you intend to use more than one Graphryder instance on one server, install [`ineo`](https://github.com/cohesivestack/ineo), a tool to install and manage multiple Neo4J instances on one server. This is necessary because Neo4J follows a \"one instance, one database\" architecture. In that case, you need to adapt all following steps as needed for use with `ineo`. We use this approach successfully on the edgeryders.eu server already ([see](/t/12309/19)).\n\n2. Follow [official instructions](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/debian/) to install version 3.1.9 of Neo4j.\n\n    All newer versions of Neo4j should also work as long as they are supported by `neo4j-driver` version 1.6.3 ([source](https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/1.6/)), which we use. We did not test this yet; but since `neo4j-driver` is the interface of Graphryder API to Neo4j, everything should keep working as long as that interface stays at `neo4j-driver` version 1.6.3.\n\n    On a recent Ubuntu / Debian system, the installation commands would be:\n\n    ```bash\n    wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.org/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -\n    echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.org/repo stable/' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list\n    sudo apt update\n    sudo apt install neo4j=1:3.1.9\n    sudo apt-mark hold neo4j\n    ```\n\n3. Change the `neo4j` user's password away from the default `neo4j` ([instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41920362)). So there will be no harm if the database is ever available on the web.\n\n4. We want to accept connections from a different host, both for the HTTPS transport (used to access the Neo4j database browser for diagnostic purposes) and for the BOLT transport (used by Graphryder Dashboard, allowing you to install it on a different host; also used to access the Neo4j database with a remote `cypher-shell` for diagnostic purposes). As we changed the Neo4j password, this is no greater security risk than running phpMyAdmin for example. To enable this, edit your `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf` as follows:\n\n    [details=\"For Neo4j 3.1.9\"]\n    Enable the following line:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0\n    ```\n    [/details]\n\n5. The Neo4j database browser will not work with its default self-signed HTTPS certificates and the above configuration, which requires HTTPS for the database browser. So we have to provide it with certificates for the domain used to access it ([instructions](https://serverfault.com/a/810469)). In our case that's as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/edgeryders.eu/fullchain.pem /var/lib/neo4j/certificates/neo4j.cert\n    cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/edgeryders.eu/privkey.pem /var/lib/neo4j/certificates/neo4j.key\n    ```\n\n6. Restart Neo4j to make the configuration and certificate changes from above effective:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo service neo4j restart\n    ```\n\n7. On a Debian based system, Neo4j will already be running, and will start at system start. Check with `service neo4j status`. If something is not right, fix it following the [official instructions]( https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/systemd/).\n\n8. Try a connection to the Neo4j database \u2013 it should work now:\n\n    * **Using the database browser.** The database browser is a good way to look into Neo4j directly. Access it at your domain and port 7473. In our case, that is:\n\n        ```plaintext\n        https://edgeryders.eu:7473/browser/\n        ```\n\n        If you are not greeted with a password prompt, execute `:server connect` to bring it up.\n\n    * **Using `cypher-shell`.** The following should work on any host that has `cypher-shell` installed. Use your own Neo4j's IP address, username and password of course:\n\n        ```\n        cypher-shell -a 46.163.78.192 -u neo4j -p \"your_password\"\n        ```\n\n    Now try executing a query. The database is still empty so it won't show anything interesting, but at least that the query executed. For example, this query to count the number of nodes in the database:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    MATCH (n) RETURN count(*)\n    ```\n\n\n#### 2. Install Neo4j plugins\n\nYou need to install two GraphAware plugins for Neo4j:\n\n```bash\ncd /var/lib/neo4j/plugins/\nwget http://products.graphaware.com/download/timetree/graphaware-timetree-3.0.1.38.24.jar\nwget http://products.graphaware.com/download/framework-server-community/graphaware-server-community-all-3.0.1.38.jar\nsystemctl restart neo4j\n```\n\nThe plugin versions installed above are for Neo4j 3.0.1. Newer versions exist for newer versions of Neo4j.\n\n\n#### 3. Install the Graphryder API software\n\n1. Obtain the Graphryder API software:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    git clone https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api.git\n    ```\n\n2. Install Python 3.5 if you don't have it already (check with `which python3.5`). One reason we need Python 3.5 is because the PIP package tulip-python 4.10.0 is [only available up to Python 3.6](https://pypi.org/project/tulip-python/4.10.0/#files) \u2026 we really have to update everything to recent versions :cry:.\n\n    * For Ubuntu 16.04: Python 3.5 is already available after installing `python3` from the default Ubuntu repositories.\n\n    * For Ubuntu 19.04: ([This works](https://askubuntu.com/a/1182780) even though the PPA only provides Python 3.5 for Ubuntu \u226418.04.)\n\n        ```bash\n        sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu disco main\"\n        sudo apt update\n        sudo apt install python3.5\n        ```\n\n3. Set up a Python virtual environment for the Graphryder installation using Python 3.5. (Virtual environments are the best way to provide a specific Python version to a project.)\n\n    * For Ubuntu 16.04, you would do:\n\n        ```bash\n        sudo apt install python3-venv\n        cd /path/to/installation/directory/\n        python3.5 -m venv venv\n        . ./venv/bin/activate\n        ```\n\n    * For Ubuntu 19.04, if you followed the above instructions of using the `deadsnakes` PPA:\n\n        ```bash\n        sudo apt install python3.5-venv\n        cd /path/to/installation/directory/\n        python3.5 -m venv venv\n        . ./venv/bin/activate\n        ```\n\n4. Complete the setup by following instructions in [the repository's README.md](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api#readme). In short, it's this:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt install python3.5-dev\n    pip install wheel # Only needed on Ubuntu 16.04.\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    cp exportsigma.py ./venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tulip/native/plugins/\n    cp config.example.ini config.ini\n    ```\n\n\n#### 4. Configure Graphryder API\n\nEdit `config.ini` as described in the following example:\n\n```plaintext\n[neo4j]\n; Neo4j server hostname (without port). Use \"localhost\" if running locally.\nurl = localhost\n; HTTP port to access Neo4J. Must be specified \u2013 it's the legacy interface, but still needed.\nhttp_port = 7480\n; HTTPS port to access Neo4J. Currently not used.\nhttps_port = 7481\n; BOLT port to access Neo4J. This is the new binary interface.\n; Must be specified, as otherwise the default is \"7678\" which might belong to a different Neo4J instance.\nbolt_port = 7482\n; Username to access Neo4j. Default is neo4j.\nuser = neo4j\n; Password to access Neo4j. Default is neo4j, but don't use that.\npasssword = your_password_here\n\n[api]\n; Hostname or IP address to serve the Graphryder API.\n; Use localhost for testing during local development.\nhost = edgeryders.eu\nport = 5000\ndebug = True\nmax_tlp_files = 50\n\n[importer]\njson_users_path = data/users.json\njson_posts_path = data/posts.json\njson_comments_path = data/comments.json\n\n[importer_discourse]\n; All *_rel_path keys below expect values without .json.\n; Even if that is present in the API route!\nabs_path = https://edgeryders.eu/\nusers_rel_path = admin/consent\nuser_rel_path = u/\ntag_rel_path = tags/\n; Discourse tag that identifies the ethnographic corpus to analyze.\n; Examples: ethno-opencare, ethno-poprebel, \u2026\ntag_focus = ethno-\u2026\ntopic_rel_path = t/\nposts_rel_path = posts/\ncodes_rel_path = annotator/codes\nannotations_rel_path = annotator/annotations\n; Admin API key of a user with access to the Open Ethnographer Discourse API.\nadmin_api_key = 95a1f8\u2026\u2026d19fce\n; Discourse username to use with the master API key. No longer needed, as we use personal API keys instead now.\nadmin_api_username = \n; To only include content for which authors have  gone through a \"consent funnel\" form on the Discourse platform. Use \"0\" to include all content regardless of consent status.\nensure_consent = 1\n\n[exporter]\ntlp_path = data/tlp/\n```\n\n#### 5. Load data into Graphryder API\n\n1. Start the Graphryder API server by running `python ./app.py` in the root of the project directory.\n\n2. Make sure that you can access the remote API by going to `http://example.com:5000/`, using the hostname you supplied in config section `[api]`. This should just show a page with the title 'Not Found'. If not, you may need to configure your firewall.\n\n3. Build the Neo4j database by running the hard update script. You trigger it at route `http://example.com:5000/hardUpdateFromEdgeRydersDiscourse`.\n\n4. Access `http://example.com:5000/status` to see statistics about the data currently contained inside the Neo4j database. You can also use this while the previous step is underway, to check the progress.\n\n5. Have a look at the output of the tab where you called `/hardUpdateFromEdgeRydersDiscourse` when it stops loading. It should now show:\n    ```\n    {\"comments\": [], \"tags\": [], \"users\": [], \"posts\": []}\n    ```\n    If any of these arrays contain values it means that these items had to be left out / ignored by the Graphryder software. You might want to investigate the issue with that. The output of the `python ./app.py` server process (in the console or in `nohup.out`) will help. Also, there is a debug mode of Graphryder that enables verbose console output. It can be enabled in `config.ini`.\n\n\n#### 6. Prepare Graphryder API for production use\n\nSet up a firewall to block direct access to the Neo4j database through the web interface, or disable access to it in the Neo4j config file. Finally, start the Graphryder API service in the background, for example by running:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/installation/directory/\n. ./venv/bin/activate\nnohup python app.py &\n```\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Graphryder Dashboard</h3>\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    git clone https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-dashboard.git\n    ```\n\n2. Install the required tools for package management (`npm`, `bower`) and for JS development task automation (`grunt`):\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt install nodejs\n    sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli\n    ```\n\n3. Install the package dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd /path/to/repository/\n    npm install\n    bower install\n    ```\n\n4. Install Linkurious.js. This is a legacy dependency that we urgently have to get rid of (see [issue #23](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-dashboard/issues/23)). So far, it has to be installed as follows, as it does not provide a Bower or NPM package:\n\n    1. Clone Linkurious.js form this fork to a sub-directory of your choice (here `./linkurious/`):\n\n        ```bash\n        git clone https://github.com/norbertFeron/linkurious.js linkurious\n        ```\n\n    2. Link and build the Linkurious.js library:\n\n        ```bash\n        cd ./linkurious/\n        npm install\n        npm run build\n        ```\n\n    3. Link Linkurious into the Graphryder Dashboard project. This needs a two-step process:\n\n        ```bash\n        cd /path/to/linkurious-repo/\n        bower link\n        cd /path/to/graphryder-repo/\n        bower link linkurious\n        ```\n\n5. Create a configuration file `./app/config.js` with the following content, while adapting the URL according to your setup. Note that if Graphryder Dashboard is served via HTTPS, then this URL also must be a HTTPS URL, or else the browser will complain about mixed content and refuse to contact Graphryder API.\n\n    ```\n    (function (window) {\n      window.__config = window.__config || {};\n\n      // URL to the Graphryder API.\n      window.__config.apiUrl = 'https://example.com:5000/';\n\n     }(this));\n    ```\n\n6. Build the JavaScript web application:\n\n    ```bash\n    grunt build\n    ```\n\n7. Set up your webserver (Apache2, Nginx or whatever) to serve the JavaScript web application as a static website from the `./dist/` directory as Document Root directory.\n\n8. Visit the Graphryder Dashboard URL \u2013 you should see the dashboard with statistics and the growth-over-time graphs for the discussion. Other graphs will not yet be there, because they have to be generated at first. For that, click the top-right gear icon and from the sidebar that appears select all four graphs and click \"Regenerate Graphs\". They are not updated automatically, so you have to use that function again after each new harvest from Discourse (means, call to `/hardUpdateFromEdgeRydersDiscourse` of the associated Graphryder API).\n\nTo provide Graphryder for multiple datasets, so far there has to be one instance of Graphryder Dashboard and Graphryder API for each. For Graphryder Dashboard, you can just copy over the files to the new website's directory and are good to go:\n\n```bash\ncp -aT /path/to/graphryder-1-dir /path/to/graphryder-2-dir\n```\n\n(Using `-T` to also copy hidden files and directories like `.git`\u2013 [see](https://superuser.com/a/970185).)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Running the services</h3>\n\nOn the Edgeryders server, Neo4J and Graphryder API are not started via systemd or Monit at boot time. So after each reboot, the following has to be done to start up these services. (Since we'll eventually move from Neo4J to our new Redisgraph based database, both Neo4J and Graphryder API will no longer be needed. So it's not worth it to make these services reboot safe. Just follow the instructions here ...)\n\n1. **Log in.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    ssh root@server.edgeryers.eu\n    ```\n\n2. **Start the Neo4J servers.**\n\n    * For NGI Forward: \n      `sudo -i -u neo4j -- ineo start ngi_forward`\n    * For POPREBEL: \n      `sudo -i -u neo4j -- ineo start poprebel`\n\n3. **Kill old server processes (if any).** Kill any app.py process before starting a new one. To see if app.py is running, execute `ps ax | grep app.py`. For each Graphryder API instance, you'd see two lines like these: \n\n    ```plaintext\n    17855 pts/0    S      0:00 python app.py \n    17869 pts/0    Sl     0:01 /var/www/clients/client7/web38/web/venv/bin/python app.py \n    ```\n\n4. **Change to the right directory.**\n\n    * For NGI Forward: \n      `cd /var/www/graphryder1api.edgeryders.eu/web`\n    * For POPREBEL: \n      `cd /var/www/graphryder3api.edgeryders.eu/web`\n\n5. **Enter the Python venv.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    . ./venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n6. **Run the Graphryder API server.**\n\n    * To run it in the background as a \"permanent\" server process (the usual case):\n      `nohup python app.py &`\n    * To run it with output to the terminal (for testing purposes):\n      `python ./app.py`\n\n7. **Test if the Graphryder instances are up and running:**\n\n    https://graphryder1.edgeryders.eu/\n    https://graphryder3.edgeryders.eu/\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Troubleshooting</h2>\n\n* **One type of graphs is not showing.** Happened for example with \"Detangler View\". Try restarting the Graphryder server and then generating the graphs all again via \"gear icon -> Regenerate Graphs\".\n\n* **Graphs went all missing.** This might be because you re-started the Graphryder API server application without re-generating the graphs afterwards. Probably they are saved to process-specific temporary files, so they will not be accessible after restarting the server software. To generate a new set, use \"gear icon -> Regenerate Graphs\" in Graphryder.\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Graphryder server administration</h2>\n\nWe run Graphryder and Neo4j on a virtual server on Digital Ocean. This server is managed by @hugi and provides https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu. Graphryder instances can be reached like this:\n\nIf the project is **ngi** the URLs will be:\n\n* Dashboard: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi\n* API: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi/api\n* Database: https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi/db\n\nA list of useful commands is available at `/root/commands.txt`, but commands are also shown below.\n\n\n## <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. Running neo4j with ineo</h3>\n\nNeo4j databases are created and run through ineo, a piece of software that allows multiple instances of Neo4j to run on the same machine. To see the currently running databases, run: \n\n* to see the run status: `ineo status`\n* to see details: `ineo instances`\n\nTo create a new neo4j database, use:\n\n```plaintext\nineo create -v 3.1.9 -p 1234 -b 5678 yourproject\n```\n\nWhere -p sets the HTTP port and -b sets the BOLT port. Make sure to not map to ports that are already in use by other instances.\n\nBefore starting the new Neo4j database you must set an initial password for the neo4j user that then needs to be passed to the new Graphryder API instance. To set this, run the following command from /root:\n\n```plaintext\n.ineo/instances/yourproject/bin/neo4j-admin set-initial-password yourpassword\n```\n\nAfter this, you are ready to start your neo4j database by running\n\n```plaintext\nineo start yourproject\n```\n\n\n## <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. Running the APIs</h3>\n\nTo start the APIs, cd to /root/yourproject-graphryder-api and run the following command for each project, replacing \u201cngi\u201d:\n\n```\nnohup bash -c 'exec -a ngi-api sudo python3 /root/ngi-graphryder-api/app.py > output.log &'\n```\n\n\n## <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. Nginx webserver</h3>\n\nThis server runs Nginx to open the API to the outside and to host the dashboard Javascript files. To see  and update the configuration, see `/etc/nginx/sites-available/graphryder.edgeryders.eu`.\n\nTo restart nginx with new configurations, run:\n\n```\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\n\n## <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. Graphryder Dashboards</h3>\n\nGraphryder dashboards are served as static web apps. All dashboards are stored at `/var/www/`. Follow the dashboard installation instructions to add new dashboards.", "created_at": "2019-02-21 02:34:54.497477", "updated_at": "2020-10-15 01:14:22.199552", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3681, "wiki": true, "reads": 27, "score": 335.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66638, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12063, "post_number": 12, "raw": "yes, but I would like to see a clear commitment to inclusion of UX design steps by ensuring they are explicitly included in the timeline and budget.

The basics are that you had meetings where people with unexpressed voices were encouraged to share and people could make twinkle fingers if they liked an idea and a hand gesture to speed up if they were getting sick of listening. Also if the crowd was too big to hear there was the human mic. You probably saw that in videos. People echo each others voice. Very useful in moments of crisis when a large group needs to decide if they are all about to get arrested or if they'll comply with the cops requests. Also since it's illegal to use an electric PA system the human mic was a clever loop hole to allow large groups of people to gather and hear each others ideas. One person speaks and then everyone who can hear repeats in unison. Sometimes the group was so large it required 5 repeats for everyone to get a chance to hear. There was also \"working groups\". These had leaders who got money from the collective occupy wall st donations which were just buckets in the park that people who worked in wall street would fill up with thousands of dollars. These working group leaders I believe were somewhat elected. Their members were volunteers. There were public spaces such as churches or other public areas and even some donated offices where these \"working groups\" could meet and work on immediate goals and long term visions. In my opinion what was missing was a little bit more structure and a little bit more empowerment. Maybe those two cancel themselves out but I don't think they have to. I think if gaming mechanics was introduced and every type of participant was thought through you could improve the high turn over and quick drop out rates of these groups.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-15 17:15:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.823027", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 335, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66653, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12063, "post_number": 17, "raw": "I think @nadia has in mind a design session in January, that would be an appropriate moment to do such an audit.

In principle, of course, banks could have gone to shareholders and ask for more capital, and some did, but in a recession there is just not going to be enough capital to go around in the short term. So they balanced it by reducing outstanding loans.

Yes, you read that right. We\u2019ve decided to go against the grain and aim for a big co-created bonanza at Frihamnstorget in September - hoping for the situation to allow for it. However, if it doesn\u2019t, we are planning for that too. This festival will be called \u201cAlways Becoming: The Carnival of Change\u201d and its tagline will be \u201cthe longer we wait, the better it gets\u201d. We might have to postpone until 2021, but whatever happens, this summer will be full of building and creating at [Frihamnstorget](https://edgeryders.eu/t/blivande-going-to-deep-dive-in-valencia/11228) to prepare for the Always Becoming festival and to create an amazing new container park full of art and excitement in Stockholm.\n\nThis festival will be something between a \"burn\" and a city-festival. Its focus will be the co-creation of Frihamnstorget, and there will be music and food. It will be an all-day party that continues in House Blivande during the night. We will be celebrating change and becoming.\n\nLike a burn, a significant part of the budget will go to dreams on a [Dreams](https://dreams.wtf/frihamnstorget-2020) platform, voted on by the participants. Like a burn, this will be co-created. Not like a burn, we will allow for food to be sold, for market stalls and for some commercial activity.\n\nAnd you won\u2019t have to wait until September. Every Friday from now on, we will gather the friends of Blivande and Frihamnstorget to our weekly Work Is Play events of music, barbecue, and drinks in the sun outside of Blivande.\n\nEvery Friday at 18:00, we invite you to come to celebrate change with us and to dream up the vision for the Always Becoming festival. Teams are forming, and there is a lot of fun stuff to be done. Let\u2019s make this summer count!\n\nOf course, we\u2019re trying to keep track of that there won\u2019t be too many people. We will be trying to keep it safe. Let us know if you will come or might come, as we are going to make sure that we\u2019re not more than 50 people.\n\nRSVP on the Blivande forum post, your Edgeryders login works there too.", "created_at": "2020-06-09 15:08:21.167174", "updated_at": "2020-06-09 15:12:30.792090", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 36.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43462, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8409, "post_number": 2, "raw": "The solar edge with power optimizers also looks interesting because it can integrate a variety of panels...which is what is at the house, no?", "created_at": "2018-03-30 15:21:53.267812", "updated_at": "2018-03-30 15:21:53.267812", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74109, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 265, "raw": "Well then ol' buddy, come on out west and I will show you plenty of them.

With a strong group of long-term residents it is pretty easy to give visitors an orientation where what is expected gets spelled out. \n \nOne thing I know is, not everyone is good at cooking but everyone knows how to clean.  One thing that is helpful is to figure out how much maintenance is needed for X people living in X space so it can be determined where a baseline is, because dirty dishes in the sink is pretty obvious but what about keeping the bathrooms clean?  What about laundry for commonly used items like dish towels?  Also, it is a valid point to have someone monitor the food supply so it stretches far enough between runs to the store, or stays within budget.\n\nOne balance that has to be looked at with a group (I think I have mentioned this before, not sure) is how to balance the physical organization with the atmosphere or \"vibes\" in the household.  I think is it important for everyone to consciously agree that they are of equal importance. Some people are naturally neater than others.  But some neat and orderly people get upset and unhappy when their standard is not shared by others in the group.  What do you do if that person is always kind of angry at the others for not pulling their weight?  And what if those less concerned about physical order resent being told to clean up all the time?  This is why these things need to be talked out - because there is no one way to get it right and the correct balance varies depending on the specific individual residents.\n\nYou could make a kind of grid where one line goes from industrious to laid back, and the other line goes from happy to not happy (or something like that).  In the old \"grasshopper and ant\" story, which for me was always presented from the ant point of view, industriousness always takes precedent over good feeling because not being industrious means you might starve or freeze.  But who wants to be pissed off all the time?  But again, someone can be friendly and happy but always the last to get up off one's tail and chip in.  I would describe that as a form of passive/aggressive behavior.\n\nAlso, in my experiences in group living, I found that these conversations were more needed in the earlier days when we were just figuring out how to live together.  After a few years, we became better at keeping the physical and mental planes in balance.  Plus, living in the country especially, but in the city too, it becomes clear to all before long that you have to work hard just to survive.  It's just that if one loses one's sense of humor in the process, then what exactly has been gained?\n\nOne thing in discussing these matters that I think  is important is to keep the one-to-one arguments under a kind of control by agreeing that matters of physicality and the group atmosphere are everyone's business.  And that it will go better if a kind of quorum is present so others who might have less emotional investment in a given encounter can provide perspective.  Even just one other person can thus provide a \"fair witness\" function.  In practice, this means that when arguments erupt, or when there is an excessive \"muttering under the breath\" resentment, that, given it becomes inefficient to stop everything and spend the day sorting it all out, it is important to not let things go too far.  When you get to the point that when talking something over becomes unavoidable it might be a conversation that generates more heat than light, so to speak.  Thus, it will go better when others are present.\n\nIt is is an ongoing problem that doesn't take care of itself, then I suggest calling a meeting with all hands to talk it over so the balance might be found.", "created_at": "2018-03-30 16:01:21.444666", "updated_at": "2018-03-30 16:01:21.444666", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 686, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 133.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3811, 4, 2569, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78768, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13861, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Missing part to add:\n![20200520_123819.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/98d73fda44c9a276f764d1f2529589de65d2f3d7.jpeg)\n\n# About Edgeryders event method\n## A 2hr process of online activities that accelerates offline activities.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe EdgeRyders events process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the platform, sparking discussion among community members.

Sicily\u2019s economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. Yet, over the past decade so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process.

In moving to Nepal to close the gap of a long distance relationship with my partner Sid, the plan was always to set up an enterprise that would make the most of his expertise in hospitality and mine in design, and so, we have been working to bring Cora Nepal to being. We run a humble guesthouse, Seto Ghar by Cora Nepal, in a quiet part of Kathmandu Valley where we take care of people who may be visiting Nepal or staying here for a while. Our intention is to build a long-term presence that assures comfortable and convivial accommodation in Nepal by prioritizing great design and impeccable service whilst keying our business into the local community and rooting our exchanges within the local economy. For so many people living every day lives here in Kathmandu, it is a difficult place to be. We want to ease off the challenges that living in Kathmandu presents, whilst nurturing the charms that exist here, in spite of the hardships inherent to the place as it stands. Up until recently, we\u2019ve been focused mainly on setting up to create a warm and welcoming space to receive our guests. We are now gearing towards setting up events and reconfiguring some of our spaces that will facilitate a flow of people and exchanges on our site and beyond, to engage with each other on issues of the day, projects of mutual benefit, and plain simple fun :) We want to create a hub, and in reading about Edgeryders online and also in talking to Anu, we found many alignments with Open Village, in concept and in practice, and we\u2019d like to offer our enterprise up as a node in the nurturing network that everyone here is working towards. We hope that our paths cross and keep crisscrossing and that the net we build as a result will be one that holds us all in love and kindness.\n\nThanks for reading, for your warm welcome, and I look forward to our discussions here!\n\nYou can find us on facebook.com/coranepal\n\nx Shei", "created_at": "2017-10-12 10:15:12.385350", "updated_at": "2017-10-12 10:15:12.385350", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 383, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 284.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 4056, 8, 1935, 3799, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78773, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13589, "post_number": 2, "raw": "\n![20200520_123819.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/98d73fda44c9a276f764d1f2529589de65d2f3d7.jpeg)\n\n# About Edgeryders event method\n## A 2hr process of online activities that accelerates offline activities.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe EdgeRyders events process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the platform, sparking discussion among community members. Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## What comes out of it\n\n|Inputs|Platform|Outputs|Outcome|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Good People|Conversation|Articles|Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves. Each cluster is composed of individuals, groups and organisations with deep ties to a place.|\n|Interesting stories|Sensemaking|New Projects|**How is a cluster different from a network?** In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a cluster, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants.|\n|Experience-based knowledge|New perspectives & ideas|Unlikely Alliances|If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies.
