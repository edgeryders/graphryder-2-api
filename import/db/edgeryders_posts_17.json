Introduction <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nAfter a call with @nadia yesterday and as a contribution to [the thought work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C04XjjED_jB_CuieoOnOZ3yYnqncr8_csHoHxMZFcZ0) by @zmorda and @hazem around the future OpenVillage \"venture\": here is a proposal for an [OpenVillage Solution](/t/id/7566), meant to support collaborative entrepreneurial activity.\n\nAll tools are named as in the [OpenVillage Solutions list](/t/id/7566). That list explains the basics about them, and this document adds comments, discussions and ideas around that.\n\nThe specialty of Edgeryders solution is this: they are _hard_ to find, but precious, because once they work for the Edgeryders crowd they can work for young people everywhere. We should apply this to tools for business as well \u2013 seems promising to me, as there is a lot left to innovate in this area. (Given that the only formal tool for business founders that young people have ever heard about is BMC: the famous Business Model Canvas.)\n\n\n## 2. Toolkit <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\n### 2.1. Agile project management system <a name=\"chap-2-1\"></a>\n\nThe closest we ever go to a task-centric collaboration solution for \"Edgeryders style people\" is [our flavor of Dynalist](/t/id/7618). [Going further](/t/id/7619), we want to integrate it with Discourse, add a mobile notification app, and eventually replace it with a similar but self-hosted and open source software.\n\n\n### 2.2. Economic exchange system <a name=\"chap-2-2\"></a>\n\nOriginally planned to be just PayCoupons, but as discussed with Nadia it seems better to have a combination of:\n\n1. A community-internal tool based on a complementary currency or timebank system. There are various good open source systems for managing this, such as [Cyclos 3](https://www.cyclos.org/cyclos3/download/). By design, these systems have a scaling barrier at around 150 - 200 people as users will only trust this type of system if they can trust that the other users will redeem the value they own in this system (their \"balance\"). This scaling limit is not a major issue though, as we hope to migrate to \"PayCoupons everywhere\" by the time that the collaborative business network runs into that limit.\n\n2. PayCoupons for community-external collaborations. As a multi-token system (every user issuing their own type of value coupons), it does not have the trust issues and scaling limit as complementary currencies / timebanks. Instead, it relies on networks of trust, given that each user only has to trust those from whom they order coupons (that they will redeem their coupons when requested to). This makes PayCoupons a true P2P collaboration system. The downside is however that it requires a critical mass of users (25 at the bare minimum), has lower liquidity than a single currency, and does not allow spontaneous purchases (except from those whose coupons one already owns). It is also still a never-deployed experimental solution, so we should not try to make it the only option for economic exchange right from the start.\n\n\n### 2.3. House management toolkit <a name=\"chap-2-3\"></a>\n\nFrom the original description of the Solution:\n\n[quote=\"community_wiki, post:1, topic:7566\"]Tools and manuals to help the founders of OpenVillage Houses make their projects successful. Including, among others: \n\n* House founder's knowledge base. Containing recommendations for steps and processes when developing the concept of an OpenVillage house and setting it all up.\n* Tools and practices for self-governance. Including best practices and decision making tools for a house's community, as tested in existing OpenVillage houses and as appropriate for houses of different sizes.\n* Tools and practices for collaborative development on-site. Such as \"Harmonious Hackathons\", a co-working / community innovation that Edgeryders experimented with during one of the LOTE conferences.[/quote]\n\n\n### 2.4. Digital communications manual <a name=\"chap-2-4\"></a>\n\nAbout safe, privacy protected communications and information storage.\n\n\n### 2.5. Financial sustainability toolkit <a name=\"chap-2-5\"></a>\n\nA set of well-tested financial planning, monitoring and controlling tools.\n\n\n### 2.6. Business communications toolkit (NEW) <a name=\"chap-2-6\"></a>\n\nNothing too special, just Discourse and Riot and our conventions about what goes where, \"no e-mail\" etc.. Just documenting what we do and why.\n\n\n### 2.7. Business planning toolkit (NEW) <a name=\"chap-2-7\"></a>\n\nWell, we only founded one successful company so far, but still \u2026 here are some inspirations for better business planning tools:\n\n* **Intuitions for business idea generation.** This is only geared towards realistic and profitable business ideas that young people in the MENA region etc. find interesting. Based on [previous work](/t/id/5712), a good way is to combine (1) traditional technology and (2) a piece of the most modern high-tech trends available to (3) solve a problem that is specific in a developing area. For example, load-carrying drones made from paragliding caps and electric propulsion. Or made-to-order 3D objects from metal by combining lost-beewax casting and 3D-printing in wax (even beewax).\n\n* **Semi-structured product idea brainstorming.** People usually come with a basic idea for a business that will not change (\"incubator for date palm entrepreneurs\"), but anything inside can change, including the product to launch first. For this, we made the experience in OpenVillage House Sidi Kaouki that a combination of locals with local knowledge, (semi-)experienced entrepreneurs and tech polymaths is a good group to brainstorm and evaluate product ideas. The entrepreneurs should be both from a local and international background, and the polymaths as international as possible since their task is to bring in common and uncommon tech solutions from all over the world. We might want to create an online service for matchmaking into such groups, also including compensation via the \"economic exchange system\" tool and an automated way to set an appointment for a call that will work for everyone to actually have the brainstorming. We might also want to experiment with different forms of having it (forum, text messaging, audio call, video call) and evaluate participant experiences.\n\n\n### 2.8. Business network scaling (NEW) <a name=\"chap-2-8\"></a>\n\nIf the new system for young entrepreneurs, as described above, is any good then the success of new companies founded with it depends on how well-skilled its core people are in employing this system and its individual tools. People acquire these skills relatively easily when having to use them repeatedly for a prolonged time.\n\nTaken together, it seems to make the most sense to employ a \"divide and multiply\" model for scaling this collaborative entrepreneurship network. So instead of people starting immediately as entrepreneurs with funding in this system, people start as contributors in somebody else's entrepreneurial project for a time (6 months to 2 years), while being paid as employees. (The usual OpenVillage House live-work integration is applied to reduce costs, meaning that these employees are paid partially in money and partially in kind.) After \"graduating\" from this time, they qualify for receiving funding for their own project, while training a new set of employees.\n\nThe important part for potential funders / supporters to understand about this growth model is: a \"divide and multiply\" model has exponential growth rates, slow at first but unbeatable after a few cycles.\n\n\n### 2.9. Financial services toolkit (NEW) <a name=\"chap-2-9\"></a>\n\nThis is a new insight from discussing with the Tunisian participants of OpenVillage House Didi Kaouki: access to a bank account that allows international bank transfer and to a credit card that works international is essential for founding any innovative business, but the hardest obstacle in countries with a closed currency.\n\nFor example in Tunisia. Currently, only businesses over a certain amount of capital are allowed to hold an international bank account, and then transaction thresholds are limited depending on the business' amount of capital and / or business age. Tunisian students have legal access to an international credit card that allows them to spend approx. 1000 EUR per year, but in practice these cards are not accepted internationally. A law enabling access to international banking for startups is in preparation, but not yet implemented.\n\nSo what is needed here is a toolkit of legal and technical hacks. In the case of Tunisia:\n\n* The usual solution of Tunisians is to register a Neteller or PayPal account or a credit card in the name of a relative living abroad, for example in France, and then to use it inside Tunisia.\n\n* The Edgeryders company might offer on a small scale to provide prepaid credit cards registered for Edgeryders O\u00dc to our collaborators from the Edgeryders community, who then can use them for international online purchases for their own startup projects. This should be possible, on a small scale, without making us a financial service provider.\n\n* A combination of Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) and prepaid credit cards seems a good idea. For example in Tunisia, [Bitcoin is not forbidden](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-tunisia-20-higher-than-in-the-us-due-to-capital-controls-bitcoin-entrepreneur), \"only practicall suppressed\". If no registered cryptocurrency exchange is operating in a country and a citizen has no way at all to make international transfers (such as in Tunisia), the only remaining option is the over-the-counter cryptocurrency market (\"OTC\"), especially [Local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) and [#bitcoin-otc](https://bitcoin-otc.com/). There are [very few offers](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/tn/tunisia/) of Bitcoin sales inside Tunisia, so it makes more sense that Tunisians buy cryptocurrency OTC for cash while travelling to European cities. The other part of the problem is how to use cryptocurrencies when a seller does not directly accept them. One option is the [XMLGold prepaid credit card](https://www.xmlgold.eu/en/prepaidCard/). However their arrangement with a MasterCard payment provider was [terminated in early 2018](https://www.facebook.com/Xmlgold/photos/a.1099420873421820.1073741828.1075373162493258/1741361175894450/?type=3&theater), and it is not clear if they have a replacement yet (you can order cards, but not sure yet if and when your order will be fulfilled).", "created_at": "2018-03-30 22:31:47.421198", "updated_at": "2019-01-07 12:44:10.461281", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1785, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 67.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51861, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 52, "raw": "[quote=\"asimong, post:39, topic:9584\"]\nfruitful to look for four people who between them cover the required languages (that\u2019s obviously an essential) but most strongly, ones who both complement each other, and get on really well as a team?\n[/quote]\n\nIdeally that is the case, even though a recruitment process which would matchmake for a team is much lengthier than the one we can afford. Luckily, most good community managers have soft skills making it easier for them to relate and interact with others, or so we like to believe :slight_smile:\nAlso, during our work together we will systematize processes for close coordination: weekly calls, weekly updates by each community manager from their \"language community\" and so there is a lot of space to learn from each other, share, and figure out together strategies.\n@johncoate's and (slightly) mine is exactly to ensure that layer of working well *together*.", "created_at": "2019-03-20 08:18:11.908144", "updated_at": "2019-03-20 08:18:11.908144", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 151, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 40.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [51724], "is_reply_to": [51724], "is_liked_by": [4970, 3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61342, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11118, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Wonderful wide-ranging remarks.

One of the less discussed \"features\" of mass communication and the internet is that we each, individually, are not wired to process the amount of information we receive. Why would we be? There is nothing even close in history where so much conflicting information is pounded into our brains. Even the terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" lose some meaning since the two are actually connected - especially these days when you cannot tell who is working for the Internet Research Agency and other governments or movements...from who is not.\nAs as example, the OP \" developing smart cities ([but what about authoritarian regimes?]\"  - what about them? In China 700+ million people have been taken out of poverty and now have food on the table and a lifespan as long as Europe and the USA. That is virtually a miracle never before achieved in human history. \nNow they, and others, are dealing with the \"positive/negative\" consequences of religion (See: History of Europe, etc.) and are making decisions which they feel will best serve the People as a whole (hopefully). \nWhile many in the West may be surprised at the idea of of censored internet - just the same, we have to deal with mass shooters and their manifestos and their \"free speech\" circulating much further and easier. It's as if our openness is being used against us since this very openness usually means big tech is controlled by large Corporations and Governments..\nThe more I see (and I have been online since 1986) the more I appreciate models like Craigslist...it would be great if Craig (not me, of course!) created an alternative twitter. We could all help! \nI know I am not providing a specific example as asked in the OP - partially because there are so many of them.

As @alberto, many young people do not necessarily need some specific area of expertise, especially considering the fact that we are targeting aspiring young entrepreneurs with early stage projects. However, the conversations, on the platform or during the community calls, will help us better understand the needs of this group and the challenges they are facing in order to refine our model and our mentoring and support offer. This is probably the first attempt to establish an online incubator or mentoring program in the region. We are proud, as Edgeryders Family, that we are leading this journey, with one step at a time.

For the data to be readily available for a graph or some other sort of analysis, we would have to know: when `wealthcare system` and `low quality` co-occur across the corpus, what is the distance of each of those co-occurrences? And furthermore, if we want to somehow allow distance to influence display on a graph, we need to know this for every correlation in the graph. What we would probably do in that case would be to calculate that beforehand and store it in the relation object of the graph.\n\nThere is actually a relatively easy way to check the distance between two _annotations_ with the data we have.\n\nEach annotation actually contains a lot of data that we are not currently using for analysis. For example, each annotation has data about which paragraph in the post that annotation is in, and at what offset character from the start of that paragraph the annotation starts and ends. For example, if I annotated this very sentence from start to finish, that annotation would carry the data `{\"start\":\"/p[4]\",\"end\":\"/p[4]\",\"startOffset\":282,\"endOffset\":453}`. p[4] meaning the 4th paragraph, and \"startOffset\":282 meaning that the annotations starts 282 characters into this paragraph.\n\nFor any two annotations, a measure of distance could be how many characters one would need to move one of the annotations for the two annotations to overlap so that the shorter annotation was fully contained within the longer annotation. However, it probably wouldn't be necessary to be that granular.\n\nI would suggest _only_ looking at the distance in paragraphs between anotations instead. If two annotations are in the same paragraph, their distance is 0, one paragraph apart and their distance is 1. For the vast number of cases, this should be enough to give you some idea as most people thankfully divide long posts into paragraphs. It is also semantically meaningful, as a paragraph break is also likely to indicate some shift in the subject matter.\n\nWhen building the co-occurrence graph it would be possible to add the distance calculation to the loop and give each co-occurrence relation another value, in addition to the number of co-occurrences. This value would be the sum of paragraph distances for all of those co-occurrences. \n\nI'm still not sure at all this would yield anything valuable though, but I think it's well worth adding to a future Masters of Networks questlist of experiments.", "created_at": "2020-08-20 23:13:59.173382", "updated_at": "2020-08-20 23:15:44.211787", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 447, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [82034], "is_reply_to": [82034], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43477, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 8413, "post_number": 1, "raw": "It looks like the Graphryder API is down, @matthias & @daniel, do you know what's up?", "created_at": "2018-03-31 15:47:56.073895", "updated_at": "2018-03-31 17:14:23.517872", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 52.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87223, "user_id": 5059, "topic_id": 14632, "post_number": 42, "raw": "Not as far as I have understood", "created_at": "2020-11-19 16:17:17.402447", "updated_at": "2020-11-19 16:17:17.402447", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [87221], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75294, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13190, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hi, thanks for checking.

In my experience using this tool for many years, the co-occurrence network tells you the vast majority of the time whether people are reflecting positively or negatively about the thing they're discussing. Even better, you get more than that -- you get a detailed analysis or picture of those emotions themselves, beyond just \"good\" or \"bad\" \n\nFor example, `healthcare system` co-occurs with `resource strain`, `pain management`, `economic depression` and `chronic stress` as well as `low-quality`. You know that the **collective** is having a larger conversation that is about the problems with the healthcare system. We are studying individuals as community members here, so we're interested in what people as a group are generally discussing. \n\nAnd more nuance is visible too. In the Open Care project, an interesting network cluster around the codes `creativity`, `mental health`, `making art`, `stress` , `creative professions` , and `unreliable funding sources` emerged. It was clear that there were two intertwined conversations happening --- where making art was a way that people managed stress and mental health issues, but also that people working in creative professions experienced mental health issues and stress because their work was poorly funded. \n\nThe good thing is if you ever have a doubt or question about why things are co-occurring, the original ethnographic data is right there for you to find. Click on the link between `mental health` and `creative professions` and you can read, right in the same interface, the stories and comments where people talk about both. Within a quick 5 minute read you understand what's going on, aided by the network visualisation.\n\n(@alberto, I'm wondering if an example-based explanation of SSNA like this might help in PARTENAIRE.

For Berlin, the project leader (@bob) made the call; for Helsinki, our presence is insistently required by the European Commission. I also have to speak on panels in both events. \n\n## Can I go overland? \n\n* Berlin-Brussels by train is a piece of cake. 6 hours each way\n* Brussels-Copenhagen also doable. 12 hours each way.\n* Brussels-Helsinki is NOT doable. According to Rome2Rio, the fastest way to travel without flying is to travel by train to K\u00f6ln, then Hamburg, then L\u00fcbeck. Then travel by road somehow to Travem\u00fcnde, board a ferry and travel by sea to the Helsinki area. Total travel time is about 40 hours each way.\n\n### Solution\n\n* I merge the three trips into a long one. This is a bit uncomfortable for me, but it has the advantage os saving two legs: instead of three return journeys (six legs) I travel on a ring in the order: Berlin first, then Helsinki, then Copenhagen, then back to BXL (four legs). \n* Two of the four legs (BXL-BER and CPH-BXL) I do overland, by train.\n* I fly the other two, in and out of HEL. \n* This also allows me to spend substantial time in my destinations.

For example, let's not forget that there's still room for steering in a crisis (or rather, especially in a crisis).\n\nBut those policy changes rarely get going before we're right in a national / continental crisis, it seems. Yet then, in the middle of it, suddenly policy makers become conscious of what they can do (and are elected to do), and unprecedented changes are possible. Including changes to the fabric of property rights, which is always a core reason of any resource conflict, and which is a \"soft\" issue. There's no warranty that all drastic political measures are appropriate and wise (see e.g. the 2009 German equivalence to Cash for Clunkers; effective, but there might have been better ways). But anyway, a crisis is a chance - to change something. And where there is change, there's hope.\n\nIn my view, we're not yet \"in the middle of it\", or policy makers don't want to admit it yet. The ever-repeated bailing out of Greece and the ever-deferred regulating of the banking sector is just to buy time, but that will not be possible much longer. And then there's a time for more drastic changes. Hopefully in favor of the general public.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-18 11:54:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.755817", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 275, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 36.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 7, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36686, "user_id": 3963, "topic_id": 7004, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Thank you for your reflection, Hazem!\n\nYou're raising an issue here that is related to the one Tantawy brought up. There has been talk of Community-Based Learning (CBL) at universities around the world. CBL is concerned with bridging life inside the bubble as you put it and life outside of it. The way I've come to think of it is three-fold: metaphorically, operationally, and methodologically. Let me say a few words about each.\n\nMetaphorically you're pointing to the notion of the Ivory Tower, i.e the idea that higher education takes place in a secluded and elevated looking down onto reality and theorising some of its more prominent features. The advantage of the Ivory Tower is that it provides you with some peace and quiet to look at things from some distance and allows you to slow down your thinking. (The latter is no longer necessarily true). I agree with the idea of the tower but not with its height nor its detachment. Hence, I speak of the Pigeon Tower as providing the peace and quiet yet engaging with its surrounding by virtue of its situated- or (urban) embeddedness. The Pigeon Tower is further co-created, that is it is co-curated and maintained by the community of scholars it houses.\n\nThis brings us to the second thought which relates to operations. What I mean is that it is important that a community of scholars is self-organised or self-directed as is more common to say these days. It is important that the divide between being a student, a teacher and an administrator is neither too formal nor too restrictive. There needs to a time and space for these three agencies to act in unison. At CILAS there have been weekly assemblies where all voices could be heard. I'm mentioning this because it relates to forming a community which can then be practices by CILASian in their respective communities.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most relatedly to your question. CILAS has been offering classes with an emphasis on ethnography and oral history, both of which took us to the streets to observe the built environment and its inhabitants closely and to interview our neighbour in-depth.

Very blessed to have @noemi on board to take us through the dynamics of organizing the previous festivals, so there's some guidelines on what needs to be done, who does it, and when. \n\nRegarding POPREBEL, the organization of the different tracks in the different cities will be on the local connectors that are currently being hired (correct, @noemi?). We agreed that by the beginning of September, we should have the first call to actions ready for POPREBELs part of the festival (ping @natalia_skoczylas). \n\nWhat needs to be done to make this festival happen:\n- \n\n* Different calls (agenda and local partner); calls with design incentives; each track call for sessions led by that curator; that brings in more people; call out: what are the tracks and how do you get involved (agenda curators, local hosts) - beginning of September we need to start pushing these calls more aggressively \n* We need a text: What does the festival bring in opportunities: **We want to set up a festival, you can be involved, let\u2019s figure it out together**\n* We need a page to know how people can register, where we announce that there are still spots in the program and that we can use their help\n* How do we people get involved? For IoH, it's weekly community calls in which we build an organizing team (for POPREBEL this goes through the soon-to-be-hired local connectors in their respective cities). After the community calls, we ask our community members to add a few paragraphs on the platform from the call, so we keep the online conversation going\n* With regard to our fellows: ask them to join community calls - design around their work, serves their work and their goals (and set how much time they can commit)\n* Marketing campaign, mass private message OR take emails and send them email, well curated email with updates from NGI (in my opinion: 1. email to all edgeryders peeps announcing, 2. directly contacting people who have shown interest, either per mail, here or phone - whatever works best for that person)\n* At the events we attend, onboard people to platform to get them excited about Edgeryders festival as well\n\n#\n\nCurrent tracks in the making for IoH & EarthOS (as far as I know):\n\n* [AI and Ethics](https://edgeryders.eu/t/are-certain-technologies-more-likely-to-lead-to-an-outcome-of-increased-justice-than-others-call-for-speakers-at-event-in-november/10326), location: Brussels?.

Here is my personal suggestion :\n\n* **Enablers:** They are the core team of EdgeRyder. They enable the progress in the targeted regions by: bringing together innovator individuals/members, connecting these members to their peers and to relevant organizations, facilitating expertise and ideas sharing and fostering collaboration between them through animating online and offline discussions etc.\n\n* **Settlers**: They are the founders of the spaces. These settlers work on implementing community spaces (coworking spaces, co-living spaces, hubs, makerspaces, hackerspaces, etc). Of course, as mentionned by @matthias  in his [post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/proposal-for-a-network-of-openvillage-houses/6785) , Each of these spaces will have it is own identity, own business model and sustainability plan. However, I think they should have share and communicate the same values, mission and vision (besides ensuring that all spaces are on the same wavelength and work towards the same goals with common values and principles, it is also for MARKETING and PR purposes)\n\n* **Doers** (Local Community): who may be the entrepreneurs, community leaders, NGOs Leaders, who believe that the OpenVillage will contribute, in one way or another, positively in their work. They are already in action. OpenVillage will support them to ensure the sustainability of their work (through reducing the operational costs when working in collaborative spaces, sharing with them expertise, experiences or fresh ideas etc.)\n\n* **Dreamers** (Local Community): who may be the aspired entrepreneurs, young people who seek to change their realities, join initiatives that would bring positive changes into their communities etc. This category, mainly the youth, are still learning, participating in workshops and trainings, discovering, experimenting, gaining experience and looking for opportunities, however they do not have their own venture.  this might be the largest population in the MENA region (We are talking about students who want to secure their future and jobless people who are looking to improve their realities). OpenVillage will support the \"Dreamers\" to become \"Doers\"\n\n* **Supporters** (Partners and relevant stakeholders): As I have already explained, Supporters have the expertise and the resources. They can play an important role especially when it comes to empowerment of the OpenVillage local communities and in advocacy for new regulations that would bring positive change (like the case of @Heba  and her biking project)", "created_at": "2017-09-10 23:27:52.510630", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:27:52.510630", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 431, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 175.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35926], "is_liked_by": [3838, 3812, 3826, 5, 3703, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73030, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12904, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Here is one for academics (and not only!)\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-You-Should-Ignore-All-That/248366", "created_at": "2020-03-31 09:43:54.142624", "updated_at": "2020-03-31 09:44:23.778803", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4779], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5682, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5649, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Monday afternoon is when the OpenCare crew, community and anyone interested to learn about the project meets online for a one hour of\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>chatting and sharing ideas about designing better services for social and health-care</li>\n\n<li>keeping others in the loop\u00a0with how the work progresses in Milano, Berlin, Brussels and everywhere else where Open Care communities are growing</li>\n\n<li>making plans for upcoming activities</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe document the sessions and post them online in weekly blogposts about what is going on, and where people can jump in to help each other.\n\nThe call takes place at 16:30 CET in this\u00a0online room:\u00a0<a href=\"https://meet.jit.si/opencare\">https://meet.jit.si/opencare</a>\n\nLet us know you're coming by pressing \"Attend\" below (make sure you are logged in).\n\nDate: 2016-06-27 17:30:00 - 2016-06-27 17:30:00, Europe/Bucharest Time.", "created_at": "2016-05-29 08:38:05", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:23:29.063931", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 166, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47630, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 9065, "post_number": 10, "raw": "@hugi looks good ,I will reformulate  it just to make it more \"attractive \"  I will get back to you in few hours @yosser you can send an invitation to Masser net work ( they can help you to spread the opportunity among students in different universities )", "created_at": "2018-09-27 13:00:22.479726", "updated_at": "2018-09-27 13:00:22.479726", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 45, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 54.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [47626], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77526, "user_id": 5528, "topic_id": 13669, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks Nadia for referring me to @amelia and @noemi", "created_at": "2020-05-27 14:41:23.499377", "updated_at": "2020-05-27 14:41:23.499377", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77479], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59779, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10849, "post_number": 2, "raw": "ping @anon82932460", "created_at": "2019-09-23 20:14:26.461604", "updated_at": "2019-09-23 20:14:26.461604", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74476, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12895, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Hi @hugi we've been stalled because the calls have been pushed back with 2 months (covid).

I've seen that this project is going to be build in many steps, and I've remarked that three hackathons will take place while building _Realities_.\n\n\nAfter a while, I've seen a post saying that one of the hackathons will be in Medenine.\nThat post made my day !\nI was extremely happy that an international event will take part in our small city in the south of Tunisia.\n\n\nAfter the coordination with Yosser Belghith, CEO & Founder of OurGhema coworking space, the posters started to appear, and then the application form.\nI tried my best to share them with students on Facebook groups and other social media, then I applyed.\nThen I recieved the confirmation email ! That feeling :grinning: ...\nLet's move to the 2 days hackathon to talk about, but first I have to talk about something else, @hugi who is as I know the Project Manager of _Realities_.\n\n\nI want to tell you that first, I didn't know this person, I know only that he is the Manager and the Director of the hackathon. I don't know why I felt he's a VERY STRICT person who behaves like a BOSS :dizzy_face:. But those was the expectations :sweat_smile: .. He's a very easy going LEADER :muscle: who has a very nice method to manage a group of people working together.\n\n\nLet me tell you now about the weekend we've spent together in OurGhema...\nOur hackathon started on Saturday, Nov the 17th at 9 AM. We met the team who were 7 developers from Medenine and 8 from other countries, who was our guests in Medenine, Tunisia. We got to know each other, then we started working. \nBy the way I went to sit for an exam by 10 AM :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\nAfter knowing what we will be working on, we were divised in three teams, to work on a task for each. And we chose the task we'll be working on ourselves.\nI talked about the progress of the hackathon [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/progress-of-the-hackathon/9200?u=haykel) So you can just click on the link and you can find out more about it.\n\nI want to tell Hugi thank you for choosing Medenine as a destination for the first hackathon for this project.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/53020afb72cd4b9cbd5fa0831f425035dcd687bd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"485\">", "created_at": "2018-11-20 20:29:43.624912", "updated_at": "2019-08-04 00:19:01.145886", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 417, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 532.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4022, 3, 8, 2095, 4738, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57407, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10426, "post_number": 5, "raw": "hey @QuaiONE!

Instead, we decided to use our role in the project to produce open source resources that _everyone_, not just C-KIC, can use. \n\n\n# Activities\nThe project has five components.\n\n1. A knowledge base.\n1. A free MOOC that organizes that knowledge base in narrative form.\n1. A help desk for people who want to adopt the practices. \n1. A social engineering component: for example, a pledge to replace at least two trips a year with remote work, connected to a simple tool to count the people who take the pledge and the amount of CO2 saved.\n1. A handholding component, reserved to C-KIC. \n\n### 1. Knowledge base \n\nThe idea was suggested by @matthias:\n\n> I can write down our knowledge of remote collaboration into a manual (of the type I create on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu)) and host a Q&amp;A on Zoom with them after they studied it. \n\n### 2. A MOOC\n\n@matthias: \n\n> Can show some tools live via screensharing as well. Not going to Amsterdam for just a presentation.\n\nIt might be worth it to expand this in a proper MOOC. More work, but its impact is  more scalable. Also revives academy.edgeryders.eu.\n\n### 3. A help desk\n\n@matthias:\n>  If they want, I can also operate a remote collaboration helpdesk in our Discourse forum for them for some time. That would not be about the everyday tech issues but about tool choice and how to make the best out of the tools they use.\n\nThis is a great idea, though I would not necessarily deploy Matt for this. I am curious to see if having a human to talk to increases adoption. Of course it would be temporary.\n\n### 4. A social engineering component\n\n@augusto has come up with this idea in a different context. We could roll out some simple tools to have a rough quantitative estimate of the impact. Counters for the MOOC and the help desk, of course; but maybe also, like Augusto suggested, a kind of pledge system: \"I pledge to replace at least two trips a year with remote work\".  Each person taking the pledge would result in the website displaying the total amount of CO2 saved by replacing business travel with remote work.\n\n### 5. A handholding component\n\nC-KIC pays for all this, so they get the perk of some exclusive human attention from us. I propose to do it in the form of having the help desk operate out of their premises in Amsterdam. A small team of two (@noemi observed that we should always have teams of two people going out whenever possible, for better learning and more sociality) could borrow a room in C-KIC's office for a while and operate from there, reserving some time for the help desk, and maybe also offering a live demo of tools to C-KIC staff. Additional benefit: we embed ourselves better into C-KIC, get to understand them better etc. \n\n### 6. Add-on: greening business travel\n\nBoth the knowledge base and the MOOC could have a final section about what to do when remote work does not cut it and you _really_ have to travel, on the model of [our own guide](/t/10552) but much better, of course. It seems there is a thirst for this. \n\n# Added value\n\n* Scalable impact: instead of greening C-KIC, we green C-KIC *plus a number of other orgs*. That number could well be in the hundreds, because [Flygskam](https://en.reset.org/blog/flygskam-flying-shame-movement-thats-taking-over-sweden-12112018) (hat tip: @nadia). \n* Increased visibility for C-KIC and their top management. \n* Introduces good practice of \"impact before profit\" in the C-KIC community.\n* *We* also lead by example, and also get, I think, some visibility. \"We are masters at remote work, and yes, we could make a business plan about it and sell it as consulting, but you know what? The climate can't wait. So the hell with that, we just give the knowledge away, just adopt it fast, every little thing counts!\" We  could ask C-KIC's comms people to push this out \u2013 it is in their best interest. It also puts everyone else on the defensive: if Edgeryders open-sources for the planet, why can't  you people do it too? \n\nThoughts?", "created_at": "2019-10-01 10:02:29.644502", "updated_at": "2019-10-01 10:15:08.906010", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 737, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 83.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59701, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10819, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Good work @matthias! \n\nNadia suggests \"science fictionomics lab\".", "created_at": "2019-09-22 08:44:41.257476", "updated_at": "2019-09-22 08:44:41.257476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49381, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9277, "post_number": 14, "raw": "For me, having been part of many crews both as leader and not, and now with the ER bunch, being part of a crew where it's really working - and you always know it - is one of life's great experiences.  \n\nAnd maybe, for starting out in some kinds of enterprise that depend more heavily on communication, problem solving and collaboration, it is similar to bands of hunter gatherers who survive(d) as a kind of crew.

It is the [Villani report](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/pdfs/MissionVillani_Report_ENG-VF.pdf) to the French parliament. C\u00e9dric Villani is a mathematician and a member of parliament. What he has to say: \n\n> California  still  dominates  in  word  and  in  thought  and encourages the concept of a single way, technological deterministic approach. If the development of artificial intelligence is fully shaped by private stakeholders, based abroad  France  and  Europe  will  have  no  other  choice  than  to  their  vision.  This  is already  happening  in  the  public  sector.  Think  of  the  agreement  signed  between Microsoft and the Ministry of Education during the previous five-year term and the DGSI\u2019suse of software provided by Palantir\u2014a startup with links to the CIA. This is equally  true  in  the  private  sector. Across  Europe,  businesses  convinced  that  they have already lost the battle frequently succumb to the persuasive powers of the U. S tech giants, sometimes at the expense of our own digital \u201cnuggets\u201d. [...]  Considering  that  France  and  Europe  can  already  be regarded as \u201ccybercolonies\u201d in many aspects, it is essential that they resist all forms of determinism by proposing a coordinated response at European level.\n\nConclusion:\n\n> This is why the role of the State must be reaffirmed: **market forces alone are proving an  inadequate  guarantee  of  true  political  independence**.  In  addition,  the  rules governing international exchanges and the opening up of internal markets do not always serve the economic interests of European  states, who too frequently  apply them in one direction only. Now more than ever, we have to provide a meaning to the AI revolution. (emphasis mine)\n\nFrance has the historical role of pushing Europe to do things its own way, rather than passively follow America (or, in the present day, China) around. If the French get behind this position, we have a real opportunity for Mariana Mazzucato's vision of [mission-oriented innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrepreneurial_State) to become Europe's battlecry in AI (and, why not, in Internet technology in general). \n\nI only read the executive summary of the report, but it seems sharper than the Italian one, and it contains some actionable ideas. But its main value is, of course, in signaling political commitment. I came across it after one of my favorite scientists, Cesar Hidalgo (director of MIT's Collective Learning group), announced on Twitter he's moving to Europe, citing the Villani report as having inspired the creation of a new Institute at U Manchester:\n\n![image|354x690](upload://AiEFBt37Oqv2bUe9z1oS8GC1xeg.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-08-26 16:20:30.994320", "updated_at": "2019-08-26 16:20:30.994320", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 430, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 42.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5209, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35934, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-09-10 23:49:30.383991", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:49:30.383991", "deleted_at": "2017-09-10 23:49:32.720760", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60631, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10980, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I have to say, I have not many expectations from cultural funds, I never understand what they are really looking for.

How does the environment we build shape the way we feel and interact? This interactive session explores the ways that architecture shapes our physical, social, emotional bodies. In offering a series of exercises designed to help us reclaim our right to behave and move freely in the spaces we inhabit, this work aims to innovate the vocabulary for embodied architecture that sensitize us to our surroundings.\n\n**About School of Apocalypse**\nSchool of Apocalypse (SoA) examines the connections between creative practice and notions of survival. In light of growing cultural, ecological and technological phenomena that challenge basic assumptions about human existence, SoA offers courses and programming that seek to develop new modes of inquiry and apply broader levels of experience to intellectual investigation. SoA has no fixed definition of survival, but engages with the fundamental questions that the themes provoke. We understand the creative potential of a school to be a space in which shared experience generates deeper insights and can lead to alternative cultural systems. The school invites a range of thinkers, artists and scientists to present programming on related themes. Subjects of study are theoretical as well as hands on, and emphasize the integration of observational and material practices found in mystical traditions, creative modalities and scientific field work.\n\n**Workshop Description**\nSpace has a strong impact on the ways our bodies move. It\u2019s design is rarely arbitrary, and yet its power over us so often remains invisible. The presenters offer a series of instructions to explore any space with our bodies in order not to fall victim to mindless obedience within it. The group has produced a soundtrack and manual that can be used by anyone at anytime to investigate the ways in which architecture and the environment influence the body and vice versa. Expanding the vocabulary used to describe this experience can then enable us to have productive conversations about the power of our surroundings and designing to optimize agency.\n\nThis session explores different ways of learning, helping participants widen their awareness and expand their openness to the inputs of the world around us. The body is an exceptional vessel to receive and inform the wisdoms of space.\n\n**Participant Engagement** \nWorkshop participants will have the opportunity to engage both mentally and physically throughout the session. The workshop is constructed in three parts. In part one, the presenters will introducing the goal of the group\u2019s work - to better understand and more actively engage with the ways that space impacts the body, and vice versa. The facilitators will provide context and case studies for the this research, and will then share their research methodology. Part two will give workshop participants the opportunity to enact the research. A fifteen- or thirty-minute audio piece will guide the workshop facilitators and participants alike through a series of prompts and sounds which will expose the ways in which the space that contains this very workshop provides the groundwork for certain kinds of thought patterns, behaviors, and experiences. (Here is the link to a 5-minute version of the audio piece: https://soundcloud.com/bodiesintersectbuildings). During part three, participants will discuss the ways in which the soundtrack, and the ideas presented over the course of the workshop, were and were not effective in growing awareness and interest in sensitizing their given professional fields to the body. All participants will leave the workshop with a manual entitled \u201cHere You Are: How to Experience Your Body in Space.\u201d\n\nTill soon!\nEugenia Manwelyan\nChoreographer, Ecologist, Founding Faculty of School of Apocalypse", "created_at": "2017-09-11 02:16:27.288794", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 13:49:41.929681", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 639, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 88.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86473, "user_id": 6270, "topic_id": 14772, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Here are Nesta's ideas, can't wait to see yours!\n\n**Environmental impact of devices**: EU citizens replace their smartphones on average every two years, creating 60-80kg CO2 equivalent emissions for each of the 200 million devices purchased annually. 85-95% of the lifetime emissions of a smartphone are created before the device reaches its owner, and many devices are replaced before they are unrepairable because it is difficult and expensive to repair them. The EU could make devices last longer if it required manufacturers to make them easier to repair, provide repair manuals and parts, and extend software updates to five years or more. Increasing the lifetime of each device will have a significant impact on the environmental impact of the internet, and there is space for us to usefully contribute. High-profile efforts to improve the situation are underway, including the Right to Repair campaign, but these changes will require wide-ranging support from innovators, experts, consumers and policymakers. We can provide data, insight and policy ideas that could be useful in helping to create change.\n\n**Related**: Minimising data storage and transmission: Can we extend the principle of \u201cData minimisation\u201d as set out in the GDPR to also become an environmental objective? How do we reduce the footprint of data held in data centres, but also of our individual use? Can existing processes like ML, internet search be made greener? \n\n**New data governance models**: We see a flurry of innovation in the data governance space, with new models like data trusts, data commons and stewardship all gaining more traction (see for example the EC\u2019s Data Governance Act released on 11/11). Moving beyond just regulating the data economy, these new, more equitable and accountable models for owning and sharing data could help democratise access and give citizens more control over what happens to their personal data. In the vision paper, we propose a model combining data commons and self-sovereign identities to create a \u201cdecentralised data lake\u201d for trusted solutions to tap into on the terms of the user (tentatively called the \u2018European Democratic Data Space\u2019 or \u2018EDDS\u2019); it would be particularly interested to study the language around these various models (given there is a lot of muddled language going on there right now - and spot emerging dynamics and communities). \n\n**Open-source technology ecosystem**: We would like to study which role the European Commission can play in building a strong ecosystem of open technology/open source solutions to compete with dominant centralised actors (move from a protocol to a platform economy). We want to look specifically at how the use of open source can be promoted across layers of governance (city-level up to the Commission itself), how to bring robustness/harness interoperability and portability, and whether there could be interesting models the Commission could use to help ensure maintenance and scaling of funded tools (launching a FOSS fund, or an Open Technology Fund for example).  \n\nI imagine this one would be pretty tricky to study from a data point of view, but perhaps we can do some more ethnographic research there or workshops with open source developers/policymakers?\n\n**Impact of the internet on democracy**: As a particularly fractious US election comes to an end, it is clear we continue to grapple with the impact the internet, and large social media platforms, in particular, are having on our democracies and cohesion of our societies. We need to better understand the underlying black-box nature of the algorithms that govern what we see and read online (and why they tend to, for example, promote harmful conspiracy content) and address the enormous power wielded by just a couple of dominant, unaccountable intermediaries to shape public opinion and direct information flows. Building a more democratic internet also requires levelling the playing field in the digital economy and giving citizens more ownership over the future direction of travel of emerging technologies and fostering collective intelligence (all discussed in much detail in the vision paper).\n\n**Impact of the internet on physical/public space**: New technologies like facial recognition, AR and constant tracking and surveillance threaten to radically change the ways in which we can interact in the physical space, taking away agency and reciprocity/the ability to consent from citizens. But technology\u2019s impact on our physical spaces goes beyond just serious concerns about privacy: digital technologies are encroaching on our public spaces; exploitative digital labour practices are worsening conditions in the barely-holding-on economy, and dominant internet economy business models extract value from our local economies, while negatively impacting the livability and affordability of our cities/regions. What can policymakers on all levels of governance do to restore the balance? \n\n**Runner-up**: reconsidering the digital divide post-COVID.", "created_at": "2020-11-09 16:07:20.325346", "updated_at": "2020-11-09 16:07:20.325346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 789, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 43.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56230, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10243, "post_number": 10, "raw": "done!", "created_at": "2019-07-05 14:36:52.344627", "updated_at": "2019-07-05 14:36:52.344627", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 39.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56215], "is_liked_by": [4096, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77674, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13700, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Certainly!

They rarely survived their warranty period in well off families in developed nations. There is no chance they would survive long enough in a large family in a struggling part of the world - perfect discipline and care or not.\n\nThe main criteria I had were two:\n\n1. They cost 1-2 EUR per player (and this is reflected in their ecological backpack as well). Same for their ongoing energy needs. 50 mAh will last you hours. A OLPC will go through 500 mAh in minutes.\n\n2. If you can understand spoken language there is virtually no learning curve. Compare this to the OLPC which was designed in a way that most function is hidden behind a literacy wall. If OLPCs were to go to the _really_ poor, there often won't be anything else requiring literacy around them - no books, no written posters, very few numbers - very little social proof to the promise that literacy can improve your lot in life. \n\nThen there are a lot of additional points, for example that if you distribute literal information it is far from a given that it can spread being the direct recipients - because they would first have to make it more \"spoken word\" digestible. \n\nSame with information flow in the other direction - it is generally not seen as economically feasible transcoding the messages / \"voice of the poor\" one would have to give to the poorest (who of course are largely illiterate).", "created_at": "2019-07-18 20:48:47.692118", "updated_at": "2019-07-18 20:48:47.692118", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56674], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35961, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6777, "post_number": 14, "raw": "I agree! the RSVP email today  + late reminder with instructions on saturday morning? @natalia_skoczylas.", "created_at": "2017-09-11 07:20:40.662847", "updated_at": "2017-09-11 07:20:40.662847", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 2.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35823], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60261, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10958, "post_number": 4, "raw": "yes yes : just make it a signup and look good thing like for the festival site.

I'm curious about ways to fulfil all requirements on GDPR/privacy (in letter and spirit of course), but also to honor the (still potential) partner's (very likely) interest in co-managing the sign-ups (and the data the participants decided to share) - and for this I'm missing the context.\n\nAre there possibilities to bridge this, e.g. by inserting a required consent (the one we need participants to sign) within their (likely existing) sign-up process as well as asking for the fields we need (choose alias and first post)? Or by using a common sign-up service (like e.g. eventbrite, typeform, airtable), where we would ask for all the info/consent both partners would need?\n\nIs there a way that such a solution does not make administration much more difficult that the [current one through airtable](https://edgeryders.eu/t/summit-sessions-quick-check-in/13560/3?u=hires)?\n\nThank you!\nDaniel", "created_at": "2020-05-20 09:13:15.285360", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 09:13:15.285360", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64251, "user_id": 5528, "topic_id": 11559, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, \n\nI have been asked to introduce myself :slight_smile: and I will add below the short bio that I use for events.

The problem with the old design is that \"many people have lost fingers while operating tuins, and there also is the danger of falling out of a trolley while crossing a river\" ([source](http://www.appropedia.org/Aerial_Ropeways_in_Nepal#The_new_design_of_tuin)).\n\n@anu has seen problems with the use of tuins in the mountainous [Karnali region](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Karnali,+Nepal/@29.5668766,81.3515204,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39bcc66413492495:0x66deea00d8f5900!8m2!3d29.3862555!4d82.3885783?hl=en) in Nepal, in the Kalikot and Mugu districts there. Children have to use tuins for commuting to school, resulting in many having swollen arms, and a substantial number of deaths. So she wants to organize a solution there, and we thought to make it an Edgeryders project and write funding applications for it.\n\n\n## Content\n\n**[1.

VillageTechSolutions (VTS) wire bridges</h3>\n\nAn improved design that prevents injuries and falling out, but still have only one cable, so no redundancy. See [the details](http://villagetechsolutions.org/transportation.html).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. PracticalAction tuin design</h3>\n\nAs [detailed on Appropedia](http://www.appropedia.org/Aerial_Ropeways_in_Nepal#The_new_design_of_tuin), the PracticalAction tuin design is much safer and simpler to use. They have seats and sidebars against falling out. Efficiency is doubled by reducing friction with ball bearings etc., and there is no danger of injury. The two-cable system has a better balance and allows a bigger load.\n\nAt this stage, the tuins were safer and easier than traditional ones during operation, but still needed improvements. The problem was that the safer gondola is also heavier and could not be pulled from across the river if the distance was larger than 100 m. Means, when the gondola is on the opposite side and one wants to pull it to ones own side to enter it. So a sag control cable and hauling cable was added, solving this issue. ([source](https://practicalaction.org/tuin-river-crossings-3))\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Our designs for better river crossings</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. First design</h3>\n\nTo be fundable as an innovation project, we should include some innovation :slight_smile: So our first design proposal is derived from the PracticalAction tuin design, with the following modifications:\n\n1. **Chains instead of steel cables.** With the two chains made from galvanized steel or better stainless steel, maintenance requirements should be low to non-existing. Also they provide traction for the traction pulley system introduced below. Also, chains can be repaired by exchanging broken pieces and welding the chain together again, and the type and strength of chain should be chosen so that this is possible.\n\n2. **Stationery cycle.** This is the main innovation: the gondola is powered by pedaling, which is much more comfortable and powerful than pulling a cable manually, allowing higher loads. One to four seats of the gondola would be equipped with a set of bicycle pedals. Each set powers the traction pulley immediately overhead using a bicycle chain. For transmission, the pulley interlocks with the chain links to provide traction. A standard 3-gear bicycle planetary gearbox is used to switch gears while being maintenance free. The bicycle chain transmission to the pulley is enclosed to be low-maintenance as well. There has to be a way to switch direction, which has not yet been thought through.\n\n3. **Balancer arm.** The gondola would be suspended from a central point so that it will keep nearly upright even in case of one chain rupture. Nobody should fall out if that happens.\n\n4. **No sag control cable.** Chains allow higher tension / less sag, so a sag control cable is probably not needed, simplifying the construction.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Second design</h3>\n\nSimilar to the previous, but the overhead lines can be regular steel cables. In addition, there is a light chain running at floor level through the gondola, and this is where the traction pulleys are mounted. The advantage is that this geometry avoids the need for lengthy chain transmission from floor level to the overhead cables.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Third design</h3>\n\nA loop or even network of bicycles running on horizontal aerial ropeways, as detailed here:\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:1, topic:5712\"](35) Sky Bikes[/quote]\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that very large gaps (up to 1.5 or 2 km) can be bridged. It would also be a perfect tourist attraction alongside :) The remaining problem is that these sky bikes can only transport approx. 200 kg of load in one gondola, so no yaks, donkeys etc..\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Fourth design</h3>\n\nThis design is more similar to a suspension bridge, wile the ones above are more like a suspended bridge. So here, we have two suspension chains made from 1.5 - 2 m long \"chain\" elements (20-40 mm rebar with welded eyelet ends), connected with bolts, with vertical thin steel wires connected to each bolt and carrying a metal profile to which the gondola is connected. This way, the gondola travels in a straight line (mostly, depending on the load) and it needs very little force to move it. Moving it can be done manually with a hauling cable, or again with a stationery bicycle. Since the force to move the gondola is low, it will even be possible to transport cattle this way.\n\nThe profiles used for this can be square profile (with a slot cut to its bottom), T profile, double-T profile or L profile. The cheapest will be L profile. With all these profiles, the gondola can be connected in an interlocked way so that it cannot disconnect itself. Square profile (say 50 \u00d7 25 mm) can also be used when using rollers on top and bottom that have elevated sides, and when connecting these profiles with bolted-on curved parts so that they are effectively suspended from their center, not from a side (which would make them tilt when attaching the gondola). Square profile (without making a cut to the bottom) seems best as it can take the most load for a given amount of material. It can be suspended every 50 cm by hooking 3 or 5 wire ropes to each chain element connector above them. This way, the profile will not come under heavy load, making it sufficient to use square profile that is bent and welded together from sheet metal in DIY fashion.", "created_at": "2017-09-15 20:06:41.211890", "updated_at": "2019-05-08 00:00:15.389968", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1194, "wiki": true, "reads": 6, "score": 4421.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [5745], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73593, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13116, "post_number": 4, "raw": "har ni sett att KI sl\u00e4ppt en e\u00b4kurs kring viruset? ping @luddilo https://utbildning.ki.se/e-utbildningar-om-covid-19", "created_at": "2020-04-04 19:32:37.394813", "updated_at": "2020-04-05 01:59:38.079406", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85740, "user_id": 6825, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 43, "raw": "Hey @MariaEuler - somebody has just asked me if they could view a recording of it.

I definitely agree with the need for a set of recommendations that would be visible in the kitchen space so that everyone knows what the basic level of expectation is: e.g. no dirty dishes left on the side/in the sink\nI also like the idea of having something to make it clear when food is coming towards the end of its usable life (easy for vegetables, harder for processed food) I would recommend using something like they do in commercial kitchens in the UK, which is to put a day sticker on all products on the day they enter the house (can also be used for leftovers after they have been cooked) That way each person who buys food is responsible for labelling the day they went shopping.\nIt also means that 3 days later the person in the kitchen has some idea of what is ready to be used, what needs to be thrown away, what is fresh and what needs using first, etc. Maybe even a special box that sits in the fridge and on the table that says \"i'm about to be thrown away, eat me quick\" to encourage people to not waste food. That's something that could easily be done whilst people are preparing breakfasts for themselves/others.\nThe water issue i think is likely to be unique to Sidi Kaoki, but it is worth highlighting. I had a couple of occasions where i asked other people (that i noticed weren't always carrying their weight) to accompany me on a water trip. Once the person refused, but generally people offer to help when asked. I guess the question is if its possible to have a system where volunteering to do a necessary task is preferred over being asked. Otherwise there is a burden on some members of the community to always be remembering what is needed. \nAgain, this is about having clear guidelines for everyone in the space.

We were using this seed project as a design space to create the model for our longer term Labs to operate.. also to be able to share that model with other groups that want to take a similar approach. \u00a0\n\nHowever, we haven't had a chance to write up much of this stuff to share yet. \u00a0Maybe we could schedule a google hangout for anyone interested to ask questions of some of the source team folk or participants.\n\nIn most every way we can determine, our seed project was hugely successful. The participants mark it as one of the most transformational experiences of their lives. We started from zero (nobody working or talking together about the project) and launched the project in only 4 weeks from when we started talking about it together. Except for whiteboards (most of which we purchased) and food (much of which we purchased), we managed to operate fully in the gift economy with the larger community (which is part of the model we're setting up).\n\nOver the course of our 6 week program, we engaged about hundred people in the community in our projects, process and work.\n\nHowever, our work was mostly focused on how to work more effectively together as a group and how to have groups function more effectlvely together for producing results on projects. Much of our time was spent on inventing the various Emerging Leader Labs projects, and on the group being able to \"jam together\" effectively, there was only a small portion of the time available for participants to work on their individual projects.\n\nIf there's interest among the UnMonastery folks, I can set up a Google Hangout or something to debrief from our experience which just ended last week.\n\nFor a glimpse of what happened at the Labs you can see\u00a0<a href=\"http://EmergingLeaderLabs.org/videos\">some of our videos here</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-07 20:58:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.549421", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74369, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 13222, "post_number": 1, "raw": "From the beginning of the year we have submitted three proposals for the Horizon2020 programme. The approach that was taken at the end of the last year was to map the potential calls and go from there. There are three ways of how we usually proceed: \n\n1)  writing a concept note and building the consortium by reaching out to potential partners\n2) \"recycling\" and strenghtening some of the previous applications\n3) responding to requests for partners we receive (mostly from showing the interest for a particular call on the participants portal). \n\nAs the first part of the year was quite busy for @alberto, we didn't have the capacity to start from writing many concept notes  and finally we followed the process under points 2. and 3. \n\nWe've spent quite some time trying to [recycle previously submitted EPICS application](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-research-project-on-citizen-science-in-2020-reflections-on-the-last-round-of-proposals-and-a-way-forward/10628) and adapt it to the Swafs 27-2020 call (Hands-on citizen science and frugal innovation). Finally, it turned out this call would require too much modifications of the previous idea as \"the intended citizen science activities should result in novel means of social inclusion\u201d. This was quite different and also due to the lack of capacity we didn't go through with it.\n\nThis left me with the process under the point no.3. How this looks like is: \n\n- we receive the request to get in touch and a few words about the project idea. \n- if it sounds solid and interesting, we get back to this person requesting more information and a document outlining the concept. \n- from that point, together with Alberto we respond to the request by a short document describing how we see our role in the project and how we can contribute. We always try to stick as much as possible to the \"standard\" workpackage and simply adapt to the topic, which I find is a good approach since it doesn't require much effort. The adaptability of our methodology is a strenght.\n- then starts the negotiation in which our input is incorporated in the proposal and we discuss the budget. \n\nThis seems to be the easiest way to get in the consortium. But, it also means we often have little control in the writing process. This can result with our tasks being written by some consultancy agency, and our efforts translated in the budget are underestimated - because we have never got the chance to fully explain the complexity of our approach. It looks \"attractive\" and it gets integrated in the proposal in an \"artificial\" way. \n\nWe participated in the following: \n\n- **GOVERNANCE 21-2020** (Developing deliberative and participatory democracies\nthrough experimentation): \"Making the Citizens Voice Heard\" (VOICE) project. 13 partners in total, led by the Hellenic Mediterranean University (Greece). Our budget: 168,5k. Documents [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1OVCfY5sMvDFFW3vqhw_PEP7udFFRQW4A).\n- **CE-SC5-25-2020** (Understanding the transition to a circular economy and its\nimplications on the environment, economy and society): \"leading the TRansion of the European Automotive SUpply chain towards a circulaR futurE\" (TREASURE) project. 12 partners in total, led by the Politecnico di Milano. Two-stage application (so no budget at this point). Documents [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1hyD9AUo8CBklLOPCTpWTIfsbRB9IRtSB).\n- **NMBP-38-2020** (Citizens and industrial technologies): Bringing together SOCiety and KETs (SOCKET) project. 8 partners in total, led by European Federation for Welding, Joining and Cutting, Belgium. Our budget: 251,3k. This was the application in which we were the most involved in writing and were able to communicate quite well with the coordinators.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experiment as it gives me a clearer idea on how to proceed in future. \n\nA while ago, I suggested a dedicated website for the RezNet. The reason is: one of my tasks is to reach out to potential partners. I write an e-mail, explain our methodology, point to the ongoing projects, to the Zenodo article on SSNA, to the Graphryder...to the partners who never heard of us, this can be overwhelming. The percentage of those who actually dedicate their time to go through the article and try to handle the Graphryder is low. Also, people coming to the platform, they see a lot is going on, but what does it all mean? How can it work for their project? \n\nA nice website could resolve this. Not a lot of text, more visuals and clear explanation of how everything works. This can be something we present to the outside world. \n\nI think it has to be divided in two parts (meaning showcasing two workpackages):\n- **our standard WP** with launching an online conversation and using the SSNA. We demostrate this on one previous and two ongoing projects. Here the potential partners understand the meaning behind each task and can easily imagine this being replicated to suit their project. Somehow, we fix the \"price\" and agree that we do not accept projects in which we cannot have the solid budget we need. \n- **the new WP** - instead, we offer another option for a lower budget (again fixed internally so we make sure we can deliver). This is good if we are proceeding as described under the point 3 because usually there are a lot of partners and the budgets are not much negotiable. In terms of content, it is what @hugi suggested: the SSNA based tool to increase value added from events in terms of better documentation and better networking for participants. We visualize this, if possible showing some examples.\n\n@owen what would be the procedure to build something like this? \n\nWhat do others think? @nadia @johncoate @amelia @matthias @noemi ...", "created_at": "2020-04-15 09:58:19.883814", "updated_at": "2020-04-15 09:58:19.883814", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 957, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 49.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55087, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10121, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Re: Timisoara. @Val.Muresan and @simona.fit  have aa lot to say about how you win and end up losing, and what political support can make or break.\n\nWhile there, the failing of the bidbook is still in progress and entire collectives are trying to cope, I have a feeling there is life after that process.

Here's a few thoughts, based on skimming the *Accounting* paper you linked (thanks!) and my own experience as \u2013 I guess \u2013 Edgeryders's *de facto* comptroller, reasonably versed in double entry accounting not only in theory, but in the practice of a small firm. I have three thoughs to contribute:\n\n### 1. Where is your data source?\n\nAccounting (of any type, even just making a list of things that happen or things you have) is very, very useful. Even small businesses quickly outgrow human short-term memory. Reorganizing accounting information into a coherent whole can be intellectually satisfying. But here's the catch: assembling the accounting information is not easy, at all. You need to keep a close watch on everything you do, and record it. And I mean *everything*: if you lose or forget part of the data, your whole information system is compromised. There is a reason why the popular image of the accounting clerk is that of a fussy person, attentive to detail. \n\nWhat makes good quality accounting accessible even to small firms in this age is electronic banking. If:\n\n1. You do all of your transactions via a bank.\n2. You have online access to your bank account (ideally via API)\n\n*Then* the data collection phase is 90% done for you. For something like 20 EUR a month, you can get supergood  accounting SaaS platforms, that import your banking data. All you need to do is to interpret each one of them: this expense went to buy a depreciable asset, that was a salary payment and so on. \n\nThe viability of alternative models of accounting depend on what other (non-financial) information they need, and how hard it is to get it. For example, the Guerrilla Translations model requires to track three flows: money, physical output and time. They are in luck with physical output, because they are translators, so they can just assume uniform quality and approximate output with word count. This would be difficult if they were, say, jewellers. \n\nWe have a small experience with time. In the early days of Edgeryders, @matthias proposed we all time log. For him, as a software developer, it was already part of his routine. Everyone else pushed back: too bureaucratic, too complicated and weird. Later on, we got involved with EU project that require us to produce timesheets, and through this experience we came to realize that time logging is actually useful to acknowledge everyone's contribution, and to protect people from self-exploitation. Now we do it, more or less \u2013 or rather, some do it consistently, and others don't. We can already do some kind of analysis on logged time. \n\nIf we were to convince ourselves to switch to a system that needs consistent time logging, we would probably be able to do it. But it took seven years for the culture to set in! Bottom line here is: no accounting system is viable unless people are prepared to do the legwork required. At least, not in Edgeryders. Financial flows are super-centralized (everything goes in and out of one, or a few, bank accounts) and this makes them easy to track them. Tracking work time, instead is inherently decentralized.\n\n### 2. Do you really need more formal analysis?\n\nTracking time can be a way to assess everyone's contribution. In early Edgeryders, Matt proposed it as a way to keep track of sweat equity, as we had no money at all at the time. But we decided that a better way to do the same thing would be to decide we would all own an equal share of the new company, and could trust each other to pull our weight towards this end. We could see two advantages to zero monitoring: it has almost no overhead (measuring is costly) and builds trust. \n\nI still think that was a good call in the circumstances. We could easily fit the whole company in our heads (4-5 people, no financial assets). This is now no longer the case. Maybe your business has already reached the stage where the benefits of gathering more information are worth its costs, Yannick. But in general, my advice would be: if you do not *really* really need it now, do not do it. Wait it out. \n\n ### 3. Is the new, fancy standard really better than the old boring one?\n\nI looked up some extra info on the REA model (on Wikipedia, as I am lazy). And found this:\n\n![image|569x445](upload://khfl6zpIwFWRa2urWzpheX1DUwo.png) \n\nIt does not tell me anything that I don't know with a glance at my (traditional) accounting software. If you were a very large organization, or \u2013 even better \u2013 network thereof, then I do see an advantage: explicit tracking of agents. But again, even in traditional accounting platforms there are several ways to keep track of agents (normally, but not necessarily, individuals). \n\nAdditionally, even if you were to adopt some alt-accounting system, it has to be on top of normal double-entry accounting, mandated by company law. \n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that you would need a concrete and urgent case for adopting anything new, rather than stretching good ole double entry bookkeeping (for example, in the case of Edgeryders, adding time logging). \n\nWith that said, if you implement REA or other fancy systems, I would be grateful for learning about your experience.

In the 20th century, the age of education as mass production of skilled workforce, you learn stuff that will give you skills to sell.\n\nI am no historian, but I get the impression that - as late as the 19th century - people learned stuff to become better slackers (courtesans) or just because they were interested. Of course, you only got to do that if you were affluent and did not really need to work. People who had to work for a living never learnt anything in a formalized way.\u00a0\n\nI have a hunch that you might like my countryman <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesualdo_da_Venosa\">Gesualdo da Venosa</a>. Here you have an exceptionally talented musician who could hone his talent because he was a wealthy prince, and making music instead of going hunting or drinking himself stupid was just his way to pass the time. Two centuries later, we find\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi\">Giacomo Leopardi</a>, one of Italy's finest poets of all time, still pretty much on the same thread: a count with a weak health and lots of time to read and write. Fictional prince (but based on a very real character) Fabrizio Corbera in Tomasi di Lampedusa' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard\">Leopard</a>, same again: an astronomer this time. Amateur, because this is a hobby for him; and yet, a full member of Europe's scientific community of the time.\n\nSo, you see: it seems no chance that we drifted away from the Trivium. Modern education is solved by what game theorists call backward induction: start on the job market, and see what skills work best. People will want the education that gives them those skills; build an education supply that will do that trick, and it will sell like hotcakes. Gesualdo, Leopardi or Corbera would have framed their actvity in terms of hobby, or of destiny (Leopardi), but they would have found silly the idea that they \"were\" a musician, a poet, an astronomer. They were a Prince da Venosa, a Count Leopardi, a Prince di Salina, that's what they were! Who happened to do things unusual among their peers.

Almost all the practical stuff is uncontroversial in my corner of Edgeryders: trust before inclusion, make profit and turn it into autonomy, forget about the blockchain, improve your life and that of your comrades rather than doing good, efficiency trumps size. Personally, I see society in terms of networks rather than differently sized \"lumps\" of people; and I tend to trust rational discourse more than ritual. But this is just me, not Edgeryders; and collaboration is enabled by the practical stuff, while theoretical differences make for nice deep discussions.\n\nHere is an actionable part:\n\n> The United Nations (U.N.) is currently our best effort at global governance. There\u2019s 190-something nation states chipping in to fund a staff of about 40,000 people trying to make the world safer and fairer. Imagine if we mobilised another 40,000 people to work on global challenges, but instead of the traditional centralised organisational structure of the U.N., with its hierarchies, department and managers, imagine if we were organised in small, decentralised, self-managing, commons-oriented, future-proof, complexity-capable networks. After all, 40,000 people is just 200 Congregations of 200\u2026\n\nI don't know about a staff of 40K people, but for some time now I have felt that \"our\" kind of entrepreneurship could claim more visibility and clout. Some of the better people in or near power would probably welcome it, if they knew it exists. In the Brexit referendum days, we discussed it briefly with @lasindias. How would people feel about a small PR effort? Like, get four people on a panel in some high profile conference and put this kind of company on the map?

They got one military compound, where the [Freakstock](https://www.freakstock.de) festival happened to which I went that year. They also have a disused Catholic monastery, which they now restore. Nobody really wanted to have that, as you have to follow strict rules that apply for restoring cultural heritage / historic sites. But for these guys, many still trained in traditional Egyptian building techniques, this works out. They live in the place and slowly renovate / restore it.\n\nTheir bishop (Damian) is a really cool guy \u2026 see picture. Everyone at the festival loved him :) Now the Internet in their monastery was broken that day, and as I was working on IT stuff at the festival he found me and asked if I could come and fix it. So we went to their monastery, in his run-down old Mercedes C series car, and I fixed their DSL Internet access.\n\nI got a tour of the place as well. Here are some pictures. I think 'it's quite inspirational for Edgeryders' upcoming deep green building conversion project \u2013 rebuilding a historic building is necessarily about using frugal / low-tech / DIY materials and techniques.\n\n![1|690x517](upload://1eYsqa6MPRCZF7nrnk4zssPxFHq.jpeg)\n\n![2|690x517](upload://8hvFnk2m0k9n0QawEJwhmHvKx3C.jpeg)\n\n![3|690x517](upload://pMLHWlzi7V7p9zAHkowDEEEiK3w.jpeg)\n\n![4|690x517](upload://1laxnXej3WpaWul0PRwjr0PiB8i.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-06-20 14:05:50.337087", "updated_at": "2019-06-20 14:05:50.337087", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 62.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76287, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13576, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Is there really mention of construction company? where?

The buildings are way larger than they need them, even though they also organize guest stays in the monastery. No idea how long it will take to restore everything. At the pace it was going, probably 20 years or more. But they seemed to be at ease with that, chipping away daily from that big task without any stress. (The pictures are from 10 years ago.

As services have grown as a proportion of an economy, the ability to replace labor with capital has fallen as well. This would impose a rate limit on the growth of leisure (or growth in general). \n\nThe promise of IT and now AI is to improve the productivity of services through reification of knowledge.

We fastened pieces of rope running parallel along the roof in ca. 30 cm distance each, and then put bunches of pine needles under them. Took about 1.5 hours per shelter with 2-3 people, and it made it immediately a lot cooler inside:\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4dbc9dbbb94584719d86e8754129d86960b8df6b.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c8f2f7a23c616f4103ecb0b4283b63fad62383e9.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nI guess this effect is the same as the \"tropical roof\" thing where a tarp or piece of fabric is covering the real roof with 20-30 cm distance to it. The sun rays are absorbed by this tropical roof, or in our case by the pine needles, and not by the real roof. So air can carry the heat away to the outside, rather than heating up the roof and the inside.\n\nKrishna, our host in Kathmandu at the moment, also said that spraying water on the pine needles would help even more (evaporative cooling), but also said it's a lot of work. Maybe for the hottest days. He also said that making them with a higher roof would help a lot, since the heat would then accumulate above head level. But in any case: yes heat is a problem, but there are things that can be done against it.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-04 08:35:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.148586", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 372, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22295], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3574, "user_id": 1693, "topic_id": 3541, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear unMonks,\n\nI'm excited to say that <em>The Nation</em> has now published the article that I came to Matera to report.

Izbegao sam u svet jer je, kada sam ja bezao, situacija koja je iz haosa ratova presla u stvarnost lazne nade i \u201ebice bolje\u201c u vreme posle 5 Oktobra. Deset godina se nista nije menjalo i bilo je samo losije. Osecao sam se, polako, kao deo rijaliti programa kome nije cilj da zabavi ljude vec da eksperimentise koliko moze covek biti sateran u cosak a da mu je bilo kakav otpor uzalud.\n  Skolovanje mi nije mnogo pruzilo jer se ja nisam trudio da ucim. Devedesetih nismo mogli da vidimo primere uspesnih skolovanih ljudi koji su ziveli casno i posteno. Zavrsio sam trogodisnju skolu za elektromehanicara. Totalna iskrivljena stvarnost je u meni stvorila poremeceno shvatanje zivota i sustinskih ciljeva u samorazvoju, najbolji drugovi su vecinom otisli napolje. 2010g. odlazim da radim na \u201eprekookeancu\u201c i tamo pocinjem da otvaram vidike, upoznavajuci ljude u svakakvim ulogama, od kolega u pravom smislu, koji rade kraj vas, do kolega koji su na istoj strani stola a koji nemaju veze sa vasim poslom ali sa kojima delite krajnji cilj. Upoznao sam more ljudi koji su bili putnici, vecinom nasmejani i dragi, neki nesvesni a neki svesni okoline u kojoj se nalaze u svakom smislu. Nevidjeno puno drugih kultura, obicaja koji nas uce razumevanju i postovanju. Shvatanje da ne mogu da ucim druge i tako lako i da im sudim, da situacije uvek gledam iz vise a ne samo iz dva ugla. Da ako sam rodjen u Srbiji i ne iznesem moj mozak malo napolje, apsolutno nemam prava da imam cak i misljenje o necemu sto nisam doziveo ili upoznao licno. Stanje psihe u Srbiji je veliki problem, ponasanje mladih i starijih\u2026 porazavajuce. Mislim da je resenje u jednoj recenici \u201eMilsi globalno, deluj lokalno\u201c, kod nas je to obrnuto i dosta objasnjava kulturu pametovanja i \u201esveznanja\u201c.\n  Krvav rad na brodu, koji je bio ocekivan (radno vreme je pocinjalo u 6:00 a zavrsavalo se oko 9:30 uvece sa 2-2,5h u raznim pauzama izmedju), naucio nas je dosta. Tamo sam napredovao od buffet-stewarda pa polako do kazina i do pozicije Managementa (kratko ali uspesno).\n  Imao sam srecu da sve to radim sa zivotnim partnerom sa kojim sada imam dete. Zena i ja smo odlucili, uprkos napredovanju karijera na brodu, da je vreme za prosirenje porodice. Medjutim bili smo svesni problema vracanja u Srbiju. Prihvatanje mentaliteta od kog smo se odvikli. Putujuci cesto u \u201cNema\u010dku, Be\u0107\u201d, odlucili smo se za taj grad. Prikladan je u svakom smislu\u2026 imamo rodjake koji vec zive tamo, blizu je domovine u kojoj smo tada imali puno bliznjih, ali kojih je svake godine sve manje. Pokusavamo im pomoci u \u201cizvlacenju\u201d napolje. Fantastican grad sve u svemu. Sve ovo sa nadom da se, na kraju, vratimo u nas grad. Na zalost svesni smo stvarnosti da je to tesko ostvarivo.\nOvde u Becu ,opet, pocinjemo od najnize crte jer nismo znali nemacki, iako smo Engleski jezik naucili do vrlo visokog nivoa, a ovde su ljudi ponosni na svoj jezik I samo na nemackom insistiraju. Prvi posao mi je bio u McDonaldsu, gde sam dobio komentar od devojke iz Srbije \u201cKakav si ti to Srbin?\u201d jer nemam pojma ko je Milica Todorovic. Nikada nisam zaboravio njeno ime iako ni dan danas ne znam ko je ona ali mogu samo da pretpostavim.\n\n  Zena I ja smo dosli do toga da smo samostalni privrednici u razvoju, sa dve branse. Jedna je \u201csklapanje namestaja\u201d koja ce nam koristiti u buducnosti da naplatimo neke usluge koje cinim bivsoj firmi prodajuci moje znanje, za koje nemam papire i ne mogu, legalno i na pravi nacin da koristim, a druga je eCommerce, izvoz tekstila iz Srbije i prodaja na Amazon.de i nasoj web prodavnici. Stvar se jos nije razvila do kraja ali je veoma blizu launch-a. Prodaja srpskih proizvoda nam je nekako pala iz patriotizma jer, bez obzira sta pise u uvodu, volimo nasu zemlju I ljude koje smo \u201costavili\u201d u Beceju, Srbiji. Sami znamo koji je rezultat u balansu izmedju izvoza i uvoza\u2026\n  Nadam se da cu ovde moci da podelim moja iskustva I naucim od vas nesto sto ne znam.

Budget tasks before a project</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Getting the budget spreadsheet</h3>\n\nWe have published our spreadsheet under an open source licence, so you can use it in your own organization. Instructions for getting and installing it are in Github repo [edgeryders/magic-spreadsheets](https://github.com/edgeryders/magic-spreadsheets).\n\nAs a demo and to follow the instructions below, we also provide a [public demo version of the Budget Template v3 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xbi45LE4RglTczENT1Eic1_TSz-5XA4XEIEAuqJgIyo).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. Starting a budget spreadsheet</h3>\n\n1. **Find a placeholder spreadsheet to use.** In the Edgeryders organization, we always have a few placeholder budget spreadsheet files around \u2013 just take one and use it for your project. It is already pre-registered in our Magic Spreadsheet (which aggregates project budget information).\n\n    Simply go to Edgeryers' Google Drive Enterprise and into folder \"[Team Drives \u2192 All Teams Drive \u2192 Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17NrnO6H-pMz0pqI5xEj-CG9qby8EFNWc)\". There, find a spreadsheet named \"Budget Template v3: Placeholder Project \u2026\". That's the one to take . There should usually be two variants: those with \"(EUR only)\" in the filename, and those without. If your project is budgeted and paid in EUR, preferably use one of the \"(EUR only)\" ones, as it saves you some of the more complex steps below.\n\n    (As a project manager, you should have read / write access to that folder \u2013 if not, ask @matthias or another one who has. And if no placeholder budget spreadsheet of the type you need is left, ask @matthias to make more, or check at the end of this manual to see if you want to do it yourself.)\n\n2. **Rename your spreadsheet file.** This prevents anyone else from taking it for their own project.\n\n3. **Move your spreadsheet file** into the Team Drive and folder that you use for your project.\n\n4. **Fill in the basic project info.** This goes into your copy of sheet \"Overview\". Only fill in the yellow fields \u2013 everything else will be calculated automatically. Hints:\n\n    * **Help messages.** You will find help messages when mousing over cells with a note, indicated by a small black triangle in the top right.\n\n    * **Adding team members.** You can add any number of team members so that they become available in the \"Cost\" sheet, column \"C (Person)\". For that, simply insert new rows _between_ the existing \"Team\" rows. That automatically enlarges the named range needed for the dropdown on the \"Cost\" sheet as well. Just filling empty rows at the end of the sheet does not.\n\n5. **Remove the second currency (if applicable).** The budget template was made to suit projects with a non-EUR primary currency, in a way that allows us to use EUR internally and to avoid any forex risks. If your project budget is in EUR already, you don't need that feature. If you did not already start with a placeholder spreadsheet that had it removed, you can remove it as follows. You could also use the spreadsheet without removing columns, but then you have always a redundant column around as both currencies are \"EUR\".\n\n    In the instructions below, column and row identifiers always refer to the state when you get to that step: after deleting a column G, there will be a new column now labeled G and a succeeding step may refer to _that_.\n\n    1. In the Cost sheet, delete column G (\"Unit cost: EUR\").\n\n    2. Unmerge cell G1 (select it, then \"Format \u2192 Merge cells \u2192 Unmerge\").\n\n    3. Copy column G (\"Budget: [primary currency]\") over column H (\"Budget: EUR\").\n\n    4. Delete column G (\"Budget: [primary currency]\").\n\n    5. In the Revenue sheet, unmerge cell D1.\n\n    6. Copy column D (\"Revenue: [primary currency]\") over column E (\"Revenue: EUR\").\n\n    7. Delete column D (\"Revenue: [primary currency]\").\n\n    8. In sheet \"Overview\", repair the formula for \"Project profit\" (cell B6). It should now be `=Cost!$G$nn / $B$14`, with `nn` replaced with the number of the last filled row on sheet cost \u2013 the one for \"Edgeryders margin\".\n\n    9. In sheet \"CashflowData\", adapt the formula in cell A4 to use columns `A, C, D` instead of `A, C, E`. So the formula would then be:\n\n            =QUERY(RevenueData, \n              \"SELECT '\"&ProjectName&\"', '\"&Status&\"', A, C, D \n               LABEL '\"&ProjectName&\"' '', '\"&Status&\"' ''\"\n            )\n\n6. **Make the first status log entry.** Go to sheet \"Status\". There are some example rows that you'll have to delete, while adapting the first one to your case. Afterwards, it will look like this:\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e1add6ef6ca9bc15bb9c9336f81a9af3b8feeb07.png\" width=\"639\" height=\"150\">\n\n    It is important to keep this up to date, esp. to set the \"Status\" column to \"Active\" after a contract was signed. Because only projects marked \"Active\" are included in the company-wide cashflow prediction in our Magic Spreadsheet. Also, the project probability numbers will be used to estimate the worth of Edgeryders' project pipeline.\n\n7. **Fill in the revenue items.** Adapt sheet \"Revenue\" so it reflects the dates and amounts of the invoices you expect the client to pay, according to the contract conditions.\n\n    * **Deleting rows.** You can delete any of the example rows without issues. When deleting an own row, remember to also delete the corresponding column in the Revenue sheet.\n\n    * **Adding rows.** You can add a row at any location and fill it with a copy of an existing row.\n\n8. **Fill in the cost items.** Adapt sheet \"Cost\". Each line represents one budget item or sub-item, and a billing plan structured by the receipt of client money. The billing plans are then summarized into a tabular cash flow plan in row 5 (\"Cash on hand\").\n\n    * **Deleting \"Cash flow\" columns (J-N).** All except the last column can be deleted. The last one calculates the remainder of the budget item to be billed at the end of the project, and should not be deleted. (If this is the only remaining one, you will also have to adapt the formula to calculate its cells to fix the `#REF!` error that you'll see.) The number of columns ***must*** match the number of revenue items in your Revenue sheet.\n\n    * **Inserting new \"Cash flow\" columns (J-N).** Insert columns only ***between*** two existing cash flow columns, as that will automatically update the ranges in formulas as needed. After that, fill the column header (rows 2-5) with a copy of that of any existing cash flow column except the last one (because that one has a conditional formatting assigned to warn when projects make <20% profit). The number of columns ***must*** match the number of revenue items in your Revenue sheet.\n\n    * **Deleting cost (sub)item rows.** You can delete any row without issues, except the last one containing the Edgeryders margin (because it contains different formulas that you'd have to get back from the spreadsheet template if you accidentally delete this line and want it back later). If you delete a budget item row, also delete all its subitem rows, if any.\n\n    * **Inserting a new cost item row.** Only insert new rows ***between*** existing budget rows, (below the first one or above the last one) as that will automatically update the ranges in formulas as needed. Then fill the row(s) with a copy of an existing budget item (or item incl. sub-items, as needed) to prime it with the correct formulas. Adapt the cell contents as needed.\n\n    * **Inserting a new cost subitem row.** Only insert new rows ***between*** subsequent budget subitem rows, as that will automatically update the ranges in formulas as needed. Then fill the row with a copy of an existing budget subitem to prime it with the correct formulas. Adapt the cell contents as needed.\n\n    * **Adding cost items**. To add cost items, first decide how many units of that item you are going to pay for, and how much each units costs. For example, if the item concerns contracting Alice for 2 months of full-time equivalent work on this project, write `Alice's work` in column B; choose `Alice` from the drop-down menu in column C; write `2` in column D; write `FTE` in column D. Column F contains the cost of one unit of the item: in this case, suppose that Alice's monthly full time equivalent cost is 5,000 EUR, you enter `5000` in column F. \n\n    * **Allocating costs to invoices**.  A key design element of our budgets (and of our finances themselves) is that each cost item is allocated to a revenue item. This helps us enforce the principle of cash flow positivity. In the `Cost` tab of the budget template, each column marked `Cash flow` corresponds to one revenue item. (You entered revenue items in the `Revenue` tab, see above.) The cells in those columns come pre-filled with a formula; change that as appropriate, using either formulas or absolute numbers. Do not change the rightmost `Cash flow` column: it automatically assigns to the final revenue item all costs that have not been assigned to any previous revenue item. If you need more or less revenue items, add or remove columns according to teh instructions above for deleting / inserting \"Cash flow\" columns.\n\n   * **Using custom formulas.** You can use a custom formula in a cell without issues. Most likely you'd use one in the Cost sheet, in the \"Quantity\" or \"Unit cost\" columns. If you use a formula, always explain in a note what it means so that your budget spreadsheet stays legible for others. For example: when entering a formula \"`=3.5*25%`\" into the \"Quantity\" column, add a note to the cell saying \"\"=3.5 months project runtime * 25% job\".\n\n**Dealing with revenueless (investment) projects**. Some projects have no revenue. These are the special \"core\" project, keeping track of fixed costs like the accountant and rent, and occasional investments we might make in business development. In this case, we recommend accounting for costs on a monthly basis. To do it, first create in the `Revenue` tab one revenue item per month that your project lasts; set each payment date in column C to the beginning of a month; and assign an amount of `0` to each item in column D. Then, proceed assigning costs to revenue items as normal. Since revenue items have a date, this allows us to know _when_ we are going to incur these costs, and so to make reliable cash flow predictions.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f28e44caff8e467c6062bca7f32a6791871d5de.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"135\">\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Sending a proposed budget to the client</h3>\n\nIt's probably best to create a copy of the whole file, or of the sheet in another tab, and adapt it by eliminating unnecessary / non-public information and adding client-facing information. And then to send a PDF export of that sheet only.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Budget tasks during a project</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Updating the cash flow projection with accounting numbers</h3>\n\nYou can update the cash flow projection with numbers from our accounting system to \"ground the projection in reality\" at any time, but ideally after receiving an invoice from the client and before paying any project expenses after that:\n\n1. In your Revenue sheet, enter the money you actually received from the client in the new invoice payment. If the project uses two currencies, enter the amount of EUR you received into the EUR column, replacing the automatic conversion from the primary currency.\n\n2. In your Cost sheet, put the current total of project costs as shown in FreeAgent into the field for the sum of costs beneath the ***previous*** invoice you received, replacing the sum formula. Also set all cost sums for invoices before that one to zero. This way, when the formulas sum up all costs, it yields the correct results. (A bit more effort but tidier: instead of setting all previous costs sums to zero, leave them as they are and only enter the additional costs \u2013 not the new total \u2013 that accumulated since last updating from FreeAgent.)\n\n3. If some collaborators did not yet invoice what they were allowed to in the now completed steps of the cash flow plan, move these positions to the current step of the cash flow plan. Otherwise, the sum of actual costs that you copied over from FreeAgent does not represent the reality of what is listed below it.\n\n_TODO: This process is a bit tedious. Also, it is only an approximation when using it at other times than immediately after an invoice was paid, as it does not know then which expenses have or have not been made in practice. Somebody should make it better_ ;)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Monitoring the project's cash flow</h3>\n\n1. Update the cash flow projection with the latest numbers from FreeAgent, as instructed above.\n\n2. Look at the cash flow projection in sheet \"Cost\", row 5. Your current step in that cashflow plan is the column for the most recent invoice that has been paid.\n\n    In that column, row 5 shows how much cash you will have on hand _after_ paying all expenses that are due between now and the receipt of the next invoice. In other words, all invoices up to and including the most recently received one are your budget to cope with until you receive the next invoice, and \"cash on hand\" is the remainder of that budget you'll have when that next invoice comes in.\n\n3. If this \"Cash on hand\" value for the last received invoice, or for any invoice after it, is negative: adapt the cash flow plan in consensus with your suppliers to make these \"Cash on hand\" values positive. We require all projects (except our internal investment projects) to be cash flow self-contained. If it is not possible in your case, apply to the management board for an exception.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Managing forex conversions</h3>\n\nIn projects that use a primary currency (for the contract and budget) that is not Euro, foreign exchange conversion is needed \u2013 because our accounting currency is Euro. By using the instructions below, it is possible to create contracts with all collaborators using Euros while still avoiding foreign exchange rate risks.\n\n**Making a contract.** When making a contract with a collaborator, (1) make in for a payment in Euros, (2) put in the amount in Euros as shown by the budget template with the date of the contract as the forex conversion date in `Overview!B8` and (3) note in the contract that the agreed-on total payment will be adjusted by the change in the conversion rate from the primary currency to Euros, between making the contract and the mid of the project. Such a rule is legally permissible because we work with independent contractors and not with employees.\n\n**Updating the forex conversion date.** This date is entered in cell `Overview!B8` and used to determine the forex conversion rate to use. At first, enter the date when the budget was created. When the project starts, update it sporadically to the current date until reaching a date in the center (or even better: \"weighted center\") of the revenue payments. This will approximately calculate the average exchange rate of the money we receive from the client, and hand that down to collaborators.\n\n**Billing Edgeryders.** For this, the project manager first has to share the project's budget spreadsheet with view-only access rights with all collaborators mentioned in it. When the time comes to write a bill, the collaborator must take care to not exceed the allowable aggregate amount to invoice, as aggregated from the first to the current phase of the cash flow plan (<a title=\"Until we add dates for each phase of the cash flow plan, the project manager should take care to highlight the column of the current phase, based on the last invoice that the client paid.\">hint</a> :speech_balloon:). This limit changes dynamically with the exchange rate, so has to be looked up shortly before writing the invoice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_[TODO: Improve this whole mechanism and its documentation.]_\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Tracking internal budget shuffling</h3>\n\nIn many projects, the project budget total is fixed after client approval resp. receiving the grant. But within certain limits, you can still reshuffle the allocated money between budget positions internally, as long as the total does not increase.\n\nTo keep an overview of who introduced which changes when and why and how much budget remains unallocated internally, you can use the following technique:\n\n1. On sheet \"Cost\", create a new column `H` named \"Allocation\".\n\n2. For each budget item, add zero or more sub-items to express what the budget is actually used for. (Remember to indent sub-items by four spaces more to get the right cell background shading.)\n\n3. Fill columns \"Item\" and \"Allocation\" for these sub-items, not \"Budget\". Optionally you can also fill \"Person\", \"Qty\", \"Unit\", \"Unit cost\", calculating \"Allocation\" from these.\n\n4. Sum up the sub-items in the row of their parent item using a number rendered as gray text, for example `=TO_TEXT(SUM(H9:H5))`. You can see this technique in the \"Budget\" column as well. Then sum up the whole \"Allocation\" column in the column header, making it easy to see when too much money is allocated internally.\n\n5. Fill column \"Note\" for these sub-items. Here, provide a journal of the changes to this sub-item. To preserve the journal, you would also not delete such a row but rather set its \"Allocation\" value to `0` and add a journal entry about the change.\n\n    In the journal, use a convention for formatting. We propose to use one line per change, in ascending order, with a line header in bold. With the cursor in the cell, in Google Sheets you can create a newline by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> an bold print by selecting text and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>. To keep the budget spreadsheet visually well navigable, set the row height to a single line of text manually. To read the journal text, one will then have to place the cursor into the respective field. An example value might look like this:\n\n    > **2019-09-01 by Matthias:** Allocating the budget for 30% of my work here to my new assistant server admin.\n    > **2019-09-20 by Matthias:** Allocating the budget for a total of 50% of my work here to the assistant. I like that help :-)\n\nThis technique does not change the official budget approved by the client, but instead tracks the internal usage of these budget items in separate columns. These columns have informational character only and what is entered here is not used, for example, for company-wide cashflow monitoring. Because these numbers will sum up to at most the client-approved budget, which is the \"worst case\" then and already used for monitoring and reporting.\n\nFor an example of this technique in action, see our \"[NGI Forward Magic Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oEnC3Aq_k5DjwcwUdfdwGYrNMXSqVmLpZHpkY1-JH0/edit#gid=2147433014)\" spreadsheet (if you can access it, of course).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Budget tasks after a project</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Evaluating the project's financial performance</h3>\n\n1. Update the invoice amounts and costs one last time from FreeAgent once all invoices are in and all costs are paid. See for that section \"Updating the cash flow projection with accounting numbers\".\n\n2. Look at the project profit value in the Overview sheet.\n\n3. If the project profit is less than 20%, look at the other sheets to find out why. As the project manager, report your results in the next project coordination / cash flow monitoring call. For that, see [section \"Monitoring the company's cashflow\" in our company manual](/t/-/6168#heading--3-11).\n\n_[TODO: More details, better process.]_\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">4. Admin tasks</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Creating placeholder spreadsheets</h3>\n\nNote that in almost all cases, you can just _use_ an existing placeholder spreadsheet for your project. Only if we did run out of prepared ones, there is a need to create more, as detailed below. Usually @matthias will care for this and you should just tell him about this (except you want to try it yourself, in which case read on).\n\n1. **Create copies** of spreadsheet \"Budget Template v3\", in the same folder.\n\n2. **Name the copies** `Budget Template v3: Placeholder Project [number]`, with a number that is in sequence with the last existing such file, or otherwise starts from 1.\n\n3. **Adapt the project name in the spreadsheet.** Make it also \"Placeholder Project [number]\", consistent with the file name, by editing cell B2 in its Overview sheet.\n\n4. **Copy the URL** of each placeholder spreadsheet into the [Magic Spreadsheet for Edgeryders O\u00dc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZpP-obQMqCdhORi5RHvYRz7bkuJKTjGAB9MYhfQXk4) in sheet Projects, at end of column A.\n\n5. **Fill down column B** in the Magic Spreadsheet in sheet Projects. The goal is that the `=IMPORTRANGE($A\u2026, \"ProjectData!A4:G4\")` formula already in use for the existing rows on that sheet is also used for the the new row(s) you just added to this sheet.\n\n6. **Grant access.** After finishing the preceding step, you will now see a `#REF!` appear in the \"Project Name\" column. Mouse over it and click on the \"Authorize\" button that appears. This permanently allows the Magic Spreadsheet to access the placeholder spreadsheet (as long as you have access to the placeholder spreadsheet).\n\n7. **Add an `IMPORTRANGE()` statement** for each new placeholder spreadsheet to the formula in the Magic Spreadsheet, sheet CashflowData1, cell A4.\n\n    (This step is unfortunately necessary because [`IMPORTRANGE()` cannot be used as an array formula](https://stackoverflow.com/q/41504050). We might use Google App Script, but that's very proprietary so who wants to learn such a thing.)\n\n8. **Fill the column for each new placeholder spreadsheet** in the Magic Spreadsheet, sheet CashflowData2. There will already be a column with the project's name at the top. Fill these columns with the right formulas by selecting the cells in the previous column (starting from row 6) and filling to the right to cover the new columns.\n\n9. **Remove the secondary currency feature from some spreadsheets.** See section \"1.1. Starting a budget spreadsheet\" above, under point \"Remove the second currency (if applicable).\". Do this for about half the placeholder spreadsheets you created, and mark them accordingly by appending \" (EUR only)\" to their filename and project name.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Design rationale</h2>\n\n**No accounting.** We kept this budget spreadsheet purely as a planning tool \u2013 no backfeeding from accounting tools is needed beyond sporadic updates of paid invoices and aggregate expenses to serve as baseline for cash flow planning. The main advantage is that it avoids form filling work; the main disadvantage, that it cannot serve as a quick overview for project managers seeking to decide if a new bill can be approved or not. In addition, cash flow projections are approximate except when based on accounting numbers at the receipt date of a new invoice to the client. There is an earlier version ([Budget Template v2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17-dhmabOMbH0W5ybzYzSJoDCP4C0M6NTvIoREMJkO9s)) that solves these issues, but requires more form filling. You can create a budget spreadsheet on that basis, but might have to invest some work to iron out some remaining issues.\n\n**Prepare for adding and removing rows and columns.** To make adding and removing data rows and columns simple, removing rows should not leave any invalid references. Formulas have been adapted accordingly, for example deriving the invoice serial number from the row number instead of \"previous invoice number + 1\". That is also the reason for the strange formulas in the header of the cash flow plan columns on the Cost sheet: they calculate \"sum of invoices up to this step minus sum of costs up to this step\", and because this formula is the same for all columns removing and adding columns presents no issue.\n\n**List of hacks.** Some tricks had to be used to make everything work, so we better document them to keep the spreadsheet maintainable:\n\n* **Suppressing `#N/A` with `SUMIF()`.** This technique is [documented here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52841125) and applied in the Magic Spreadsheet in `CashflowData2!D6:`.\n\n* **Excluding cells from sums by using text.** On the Cost sheet, there is a budget and cash flow plan for both a budget items and its subitems. But only one or the other must be included when calculating column totals, so the subtotals for the budget item are text cells rather than numbers. This way, they do not have any effect on column sums. All such text cells are shown automatically in gray to indicate that they are \"inactive\", not making it into the sums.\n\n* **Pretty-printing formulas.** This requires to work around a bug in Google Sheets, and is documented [here](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/127861).", "created_at": "2018-10-12 15:00:53.483754", "updated_at": "2019-09-24 15:46:14.238936", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4398, "wiki": true, "reads": 22, "score": 420.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18743, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 5866, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Very late reply</b>\n\nAnd not really a reply at all to @Alberto 's remarks, since I am not sure about the answer. Indeed the total PayCoupons liquidity is limited by the amount of P2P credits that can reasonably exist in a network of people and companies (assume approx. one year of everyone's worktime, and for shops, 1-2 times the turnover equivalent of their stock levels). Because beyond that, people will fear coupons issued by \"over-issuing\" parties could become irredeemable, so they will stop ordering. (PayCoupons does not yet show these numbers, but will.)\n\nMy hunch is that this amount of liquidity is sufficient for the goods and services economy (\"real economy\" as Germans like to say), but not sufficient for anything more financialized (options and futures, shares, speculation, rolling debt, sovereign debt). It may not even be enough for large purchases (like buying a family home). When that becomes a practical problem, we'll have to recommend to people to use PayCoupons to save up in scarce token-style money (legal tender, gold or Bitcoins) before being able to make the purchase.\n\nThat is partially \"a feature not a bug\", since PayCoupons is designed to be a tool for economic exchange, not also a store of value. Because whenever one tries to mix both functions into the same tool, you end up with a bad compromise (\"valuableness\" wants to increase scarcity, \"usefulness for exchange\" wants to increase liquidity). People may however invent a hack (to be able to use PayCoupons for huge purchases) and save up in coupons of multiple large corporations, which are \"creditworthy\" for larger amounts of coupons, then transfer them as payment to whoever sells them the family home.

Here are some guidelines adapted from advice that @lroddy sent me:\n\n\n## 1. Before even starting to write ask yourself: What is the aim of a weekly summary/ newsletter? Of this one in particular? Is it to encourage interaction within the community?**\n\nYES! We want the newsletter to help spread the word about the great work our community members are doing.If we do a good job of featuring their topic on the newsletter on a certain week, it also informs the entire community on what is being discussed. This encourages learning, more collaboration etc.\n\n### Make it digestible.\n\nEdgeRyders is made up of a smart bunch of people but that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone will necessarily understand certain words used within a certain profession or expert area.\n\n**Write the newsletter in such a way as to make the posts digestible and say to the community \u201chey this thread is really important - here\u2019s why you should join this conversation.\u201d**\n\n## Be respectful of people\u2019s time.\n\nA newsletter can save time for the busy members who just want an overview of what\u2019s being discussed.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be overwhelmingly long and each reader should learn something new having read the newsletter itself. Have an idea sparked. Or be shown a really important thread.\n\n## 2. When approaching the writing of the newsletter ask what happened in the world in the last week and how did it feature in conversations on EdgeRyder? What issues or solutions did EdgeRyder\u2019s communities raise this week in relation to that newspiece?\n\n### Don\u2019t be afraid to set the agenda.\n\n**What edgeryders do  *is*  newsworthy** . Leonie interviewed a professor of linguistics and migration that was mentioned on the 27th of May newsletter - that\u2019s newsworthy.\n\n**Build a connections between now and then**  Sometimes communities put forward a new idea for a problem that had been discussed on the site three years ago and it is resonating again with the community - that\u2018s important to highlight.\n\n## 3. Try to find a new angle, and look forward to what will be relevant soon.\n\nA good example\u2026\n\nThe conversation around Covid 19 has been discussed a lot over the past few months since it reached Europe, a certain amount of fatigue sets in for many, particularly as it\u2019s in the mainstream media so much too.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important and shouldn\u2019t be written about and a way EdgeRyders can overcome disinterest in certain threads concerning a rolling topic is for newsletters to note how that conversation and discussion has evolved.\n\n*For instance, when Coronavirus lockdowns began there was a lot of talk about how companies and employees would adapt to working remotely. The conversation changed to the fact that it pressured certain employers into seeing that it worked and then in the last two weeks came Twitter and Facebook announcements that all staff in US offices would be working from home. This conversation is going to move along more as people consider what it will mean for town and city centres that had office buildings and space bought up by large tech companies. What will it mean for the restaurants and coffee shops that sprouted up with these buildings and rely on commuters for custom? Google announced it will give \u20ac1000 to each employee for office equipment to use at home. Will apartments be built larger from now on to accommodate home office space? * *These are all interesting questions that follow the story through* .\n\n## 4. Pick an engaging headline or subject line for the newsletter.\n\nIt\u2019s important to put some thought into the subject title. Some of our topic subject lines work well in summarising what is in the newsletter and those interested can click on. Example from 20th of May :[The second coming of big tech, statistics and the edgeryders online summit](https://edgeryders.eu/t/conversation-overview-20th-of-may-2020-the-second-coming-of-big-tech-statistics-and-the-edgeryders-online-summit/13599)\n\nIf you saw \u201cThe second coming of big tech\u201d you would click to see what it is about. When you do click on you see that the second coming is happening because of Covid 19. That\u2019s a really interesting outcome.

Bywa\u0142em w r\u00f3\u017cnych miejscach, ale to jest moje, tu przynale\u017c\u0119. Ja nie tylko jestem przeciwko UE, ja jestem przeciwko jakimkolwiek formom na si\u0142\u0119 zrzeszania si\u0119 ludzi. Tak samo jak jestem przeciwko normom unijnym NA WSZYSTKO, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 nam narzucane bezrefleksyjnie. UE by\u0142a potrzebna Niemcom i Francji, bo to oni rozkr\u0119cali wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 wojen. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce to jest mo\u017cliwe, \u017ceby Polska by\u0142a poza UE, ale do tego trzeba polityk\u00f3w z charakterem, kt\u00f3rzy sprzeciwi\u0105 si\u0119 absurdom i wtedy mo\u017cna dzia\u0142a\u0107 na w\u0142asn\u0105 r\u0119k\u0119. S\u0105 kraje, kt\u00f3re to potrafi\u0105. \n\nJest kilka korzy\u015bci z obecno\u015bci w strukturach: przep\u0142yw ludzi i towar\u00f3w, ale ten kij te\u017c ma dwa ko\u0144ce. Bo np. brak kontroli na granicach jest te\u017c du\u017cym zagro\u017ceniem. Nie zawsze tak sceptycznie podchodzi\u0142em do spraw spo\u0142ecznych. Dawno temu popiera\u0142em ca\u0142ym sercem Solidarno\u015b\u0107, dzia\u0142a\u0142em jeszcze jako dziecko. Tak\u017ce pami\u0119tam jak to wygl\u0105da\u0142o i obserwowa\u0142em proces zmian, jak pozmienia\u0142o si\u0119 na gorsze i dlaczego ludzie powyje\u017cd\u017cali za granic\u0119. I wiem dlaczego nie ma przemys\u0142u w moich stronach, ale za to jakie\u015b specjalne strefy ekonomiczne, gdzie niemieckie i belgijskie firmy maj\u0105 zwolnienia z podatk\u00f3w. Polskie nie mog\u0105 tam by\u0107. A pracuj\u0105 tam...Ukrai\u0144cy, czy jak w \u017barnowcu Filipi\u0144czycy. No bo jak nie ma czterech milion\u00f3w m\u0142odych ludzi, to trzeba ich \u015bci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 z zagranicy. O ile chce si\u0119 utrzyma\u0107 wzrost gospodarczy na si\u0142\u0119. Tak\u017ce m\u00f3j optymizm ulecia\u0142 po 1990 roku, kiedy to powinienem z racji wieku tryska\u0107 pozytywn\u0105 energi\u0105. Widzia\u0142em co si\u0119 w\u00f3wczas u nas dzia\u0142o, jak ludzie z dnia na dzie\u0144 tracili prac\u0119, pr\u0119\u017cne firmy przejmowane by\u0142y za bezcen. \n\nW Szwajcarii te\u017c mamy kapitalizm i nie ma takich problem\u00f3w. To chyba mentalno\u015b\u0107 homo sovieticus tak ukszta\u0142towa\u0142a nasz kapitalizm. A perspektywa nie przedstawia si\u0119 kolorowo, bo ludzie wci\u0105\u017c wyje\u017cd\u017caj\u0105. Przynajmniej z mojego \u015brodowiska- Dolnego \u015al\u0105ska. Powoli robi nam si\u0119 \u201epustynia\u201d pod ka\u017cdym wzgl\u0119dem: demograficznym, gospodarczym. Moje miasto to miejsce, do kt\u00f3rego przyje\u017cd\u017casz na jeden dzie\u0144 i wyje\u017cd\u017ca. Tu nikt na d\u0142u\u017cej nie zostaje. M\u0142odych wysya Wroc\u0142aw, cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 tam zostaje, a reszta rusza w \u015bwiat. No dramat. Gdyby oni poznawali \u015bwiat i wracali, to super, ale oni nie wracaj\u0105. Ludzie stracili nadziej\u0119 na jak\u0105kolwiek zmian\u0119. Ju\u017c z tym nie walcz\u0105, tylko wyje\u017cd\u017caj\u0105. Inna sprawa, \u017ce tutaj nie ma nikogo z \u201edziada pradziada\u201d. Wszyscy tutaj s\u0105 przyjezdni. Moi przodkowie przybyli ze Wschodu, z okolic Lwowa.\n\nWracaj\u0105c do UE. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce z 10 lat potrwa jeszcze nasza przygoda w tej organizacji.  Co ciekawe kiedy\u015b by\u0142em bardziej radykalny w swoich pogl\u0105dach, nawet agresywny. Od zawsze twierdzi\u0142em, \u017ce ta ca\u0142a impreza z UE ma s\u0142u\u017cy\u0107 Niemcom i Francji i mia\u0142em racj\u0119. Po\u0142owa inwestycji realizowanych w budownictwie i przemy\u015ble s\u0105 z Niemiec, materia\u0142y i firmy. A my tylko pracujemy.  Jeste\u015bmy takim Bantustanem dla nich. Traktuj\u0105 nas z g\u00f3ry, awanturuj\u0105 si\u0119 w restauracjach, \u017ce nie m\u00f3wi si\u0119 po niemiecku. Nie ma komu budowa\u0107 spo\u0142eczno\u015bci, a m\u0142odzi maj\u0105 telefony zamiast m\u00f3zgu. \n\nJak mo\u017cna by to zmieni\u0107? My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce to kwestia podatk\u00f3w. Jak s\u0105 z\u0142e podatki, to si\u0119 \u017ale zaczyna dzia\u0107. Ludzie uciekaj\u0105 do miejsc, gdzie zostaje im w kieszeni, gdzie maj\u0105 lepsze perspektywy, lepszy socjal. To jest proste. A u nas nie ma odpowiedzialno\u015bci za sprawowanie urz\u0119d\u00f3w, za podejmowane decyzje. Tutaj nie ma poczucia odpowiedzialno\u015bci, poczucia wsp\u00f3lnoty, zbieranina ludzi zewsz\u0105d. Panuje taka mentalno\u015b\u0107, \u017ce \u201eprzyjad\u0105 Niemcy i tak zabior\u0105\u201d. S\u0105 tutaj domy, kt\u00f3re nie by\u0142y remontowane przez d\u0142ugie lata, bo \u201epo co naprawia\u0107 skoro kto\u015b w ko\u0144cu po to przyjdzie\u201d. I to najlepiej oddaje mentalno\u015b\u0107 tego regionu. Cz\u0119sto si\u0119 s\u0142yszy, \u017ce ludziom zarzuca si\u0119 pogl\u0105dy faszystowskie, czy nacjonalistyczne, a ludzie cz\u0119sto broni\u0105 tylko swojego interesu. A w\u0142adze, te same od dwudziestu lat zajmuj\u0105 si\u0119 tym samym, czyli niczym.

And we came up with the following:\n\nOne of the hurdles Edgeryders currently runs into, is the massive amounts of valuable information, but no clear overview what Edgeryders is all about. In other words, why should \"I, as new visitor (possible new community member or new partner/funder) trust Edgeryders - and subsequently join and become active\" in the community. \n\nWe have a lot of great standalone threads and stories, but an overarching message is missing: \n1. What is being discussed on Edgeryders right now? (meta)\n2. What results have the projects Edgeryders has been part of had? (who ahve we partnered with, what has been the impact, etc)\n3. Who is Edgeryders? \n\nWe can fill this gap. And a, likely, impactful method is by:\n- writing up engaging long-reads with personal thoughts by the founders, and other instrumental members who have been/know the community through and through. \n- push this content in the right channels (Linkedin, Medium, @anon82932460 may have some ideas as well).\n- use the longform to cut out nice social lines and use this throughout other social media pushing our threads and stories from the community members on the platform\n\n\nOver the next few months I will be working several features - which means I'll have to ask a little bit of time from all of you individually for interviews. Usually, an interview for a profile takes between one and two hours (it depends on the flow: if you feel comfortable, the time will fly by and before you know it, we've been talking for several hours).  And I will have to do desk-research prior to the interview, and after the interview. \n\nWhy these profiles? Character-based narratives are one of the most engaging written forms of storytelling. And to tell the story of something \"abstract\", the best manner to make the meta a little less meta, is by letting the story being led by a main character. In this case: you. \n\nOver the next 6 months, I will write 6 different features.

Once elected, they seem to lose part of their magic. That happened, as you say, to the Palikot movement in Poland; and is happening right now to the Five Star Movement.

I was helping to build shelters, but i was also a little scared for myself:\u00a0my safety, my equipment, 'getting the job done correctly'. It was only by standing back from the action and just talking to some of the camp residents\u00a0who were trying to help us that i found out more about them. Many of them had been engineers or builders before they embarked on their journey to a safer life.\n\nI realised that these people were more qualified than i was, had more reason to make sure the shelter was built well and could be trusted with our equipment because it was of great value to them that we had brought it to the camp.\n\nI had to turn off the switch in my head that was about 'me' and truely be there for them. But it could only be done by firstly opening a dialogue, then through mutual understanding and cooperation.\n\nAs the day went on the residents who were working with us drifted away (to do tasks like cooking, eating, prayer, preparation for the nighttime, talking to family at home/friends in other countries) and we found ourselves continuing the work as our orginal team.

As a result 16 people had a drier, warmer place to sleep that night.\n\nBut we could have walked on site, dropped all the materials and equipment off and sat drinking chai and talking to the residents for the whole afternoon whilst they built the shelters themselves and we would have been just as helpful, just as caring, just as useful to the people.\n\nPeople first, mission second.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-22 18:49:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.586736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23373, "user_id": 6, "topic_id": 1236, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Cultures of sharing</b>\n\nHi Neal,\n\nThis really strikes a chord with me - my research interest is sustainable consumption and one of the things that intrigues me within the debates in this arena is the potential of collaborative consumption.\u00a0 I guess the thing that plays on my mind is how to mainstream the idea of sharing - sure, we do it amongst family and friends without thinking, but building the trust within a wider community such that members feel able to share cars, for instance, involves quite a leap.\u00a0 A key question, I think, is how to create a mass culture of sharing.\n\nTaking the example of car sharing business Streetcar (now Zipcar) in the UK - it currently operates in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol and Maidstone.\u00a0 Each of these locations share (aha!) two important characteristics: first, they are all towns/cities that have grown from ancient settlements, such that the shape and planning of the streets makes heavy road use nothing short of a nightmare.\u00a0 (I can vouch for this having lived in Cambridge for ten years and never for a moment considered having a car here!)\u00a0 Second, they each have communities that are strongly and visibly committed to the idea of sustainability.\u00a0 These are the two key ingredients that have meant Streetcar/Zipcar has taken off in these locations.\u00a0 The combination of the mobility challenges presented by the geography of each town/city, along with the core values of people within those communities who are committed to driving change has meant that this form of sharing has worked.\n\nBut what about other towns and cities - where there is more space for private parking; where public transport provision is appalling; where the sustainability agenda remains invisible?\u00a0 When I visit my home town in the north of England - where all of this applies - I often wonder what other values one would need to mobilise in order to generate enthusiasm for forms of collaborative consumption such as car sharing.\n\nI wonder whether this is something you discussed in the salons you organised.\u00a0 I know for a fact that when I move on from Cambridge - such a great place for community collaboration - I'm going to be frustrated by the lack of easily discernable 'hooks' to engage people in places where the conditions of personal mobility, as well as community priorities, are likely to be very different.\u00a0 I'd love to hear any ideas you have.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-18 19:06:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.817341", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43970, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6811, "post_number": 15, "raw": "For the report and papers I just used GraphRyder to see the text associated for the code, but for recoding it's important to be able  to do this in OE itself.", "created_at": "2018-04-16 15:59:48.438014", "updated_at": "2018-04-16 15:59:48.438014", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43969], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42448, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 8165, "post_number": 2, "raw": "What a great write-up, this is a really useful post to link to when describing the outcomes and impact you can expect when working with the Edgeryders network.

Kako mozes da doprineses svetu oko sebe?\n1- Da imas analiticki pristup i kazes ovo ne funkcionise i ovde moze nesto da se popravi ili 2-kreativno da prisupis i kazes ovde nesto nedostaje, ali nadjimo resenje\n\n**2)** O medijumu. Mozda neko muca pa je crtanje dobar medijum. Trazio je svoje medijume komunikacije i onda je i verbalna komunikacija postala laksa.\n\n**3)** Kad postanes dobar u necemu pocnes da privlacis i druge ljude koji su dobri u necemu drugom. Stvara se bubble ljudi. Okruzivanje ljudima koji iskoriste svaki momenat da nauce nesto jedni druge.\n\n**4)** Iz grupe ljudi koji su nesto stvarali zajedno, prelazak komunikacije iz \u201cja pa ja pa ja\u201d u to da zaista iskomuniciras i zainteresujes ostalu trojicu ljudi za neki zajednicki cilj.\n\n**5)** Kad je otvorio firmu kako sad na tom nivou pricati, stvaranje empatije i motivacije sa zaposlenima. Komunikacija sa kolegama.\n\n**6)** Firma raste. Skroz drugacija komunikacija u 4 zida i onda kada te neko vidi jednom dnevno na kratko. Preko 170 ljudi zaposljava, ekosistem komunikacije je drugaciji u takvoj sredini.\n\n**7)**: Dobili su neku madjunarodnu nagradu. Fokus na komunikaciju kao edukaciju drugih ljudi, cesto van firme. Vezano za entrepreneurship, gaming, \u2026\n\n**8)** Nakon nagrada dolazi do vise saradnje sa strancima i najvecim svetskim gaming kucama. Izgradnja partnerskih odnosa gde nijedna strana nije podredjena, terate jedni druge da budete najbolji.\n\n**9)** Fokus na slobodno vreme. Kad si vlasnik mozes sam sebi da odredis kojih 16h dnevno ces da radis :) van posla, fokus na hobije, doprinos tome da bude kvalitetan sagovrnik i u tim pricama.\n**10)** Porodica, od skoro ozenjen, to je posebna komunikacija u partnerskim odnosima, ne prepustanju slucaju i ne uzimanju svari zdravo za gotovo.\n\nJedanaesti momenat: Community, rad sa Vladom Srbije, Apple - gaming zajednica, da ljudi iz Sonyja ne moraju da krijumcare uredjaje u Srbiju, da PayPal normalno funkcionise, otvaranje hub-ova, komunikacija sa drzavom sa jedne strane a sa druge strane role model nekim klincima. Stanje u preduyetnistvu u Srbiji.\n\nQ&A\n**Pitanje o pausalcima i porezima.** Postojanje subvencija. Tehnicki podaci.\n\n**Pitanje o nivou fluktuacije ljudi u firmi**. Vrlo malo odlaze. Malo su kao sekta. Ima puno ljubavnih trouglova, cetvorouglova. Ljudi se osecaju kao da su na fakultetu samo su placeni za to. Ne bi ni voleo da se ljudi ususkaju previse. Koliko iz toga proisticu neki blistavi primeri, toliko i postoji i neki rep ljudi koji ne odlaze, postoji rizik da se to pretvori u drzavni posao, tako da je niska fluktuacija mac sa dve ostrice.\n\n**Velika firma je preko 150 ljudi tako da izlazi iz domena plemena. Sta uraditi po pitanju ovog? Organizaciona resenja, kadrovska?**\n\nUros prica o binarnosti stvari i spektru stvari. \u201cDa li bi da firma bude kao sportski tim ili kao porodica?\u201d Tesko je binarno odgovoriti. Ali poenta je pravljenju arshina koji pravi neki balans i uzima aspekte sa razlicitih krajeva spektra.\nPruziti sansu ljudima, Vecina interkacija nije korisna. Ali dovoljna je ta jedna da promeni tok stvari u zivotu.Uros ima visoke standarde i voli da prica sa ljudima kao da umeju da rade stvari.\nPreporucuje pricanje sa sto vise ljudi i dopustanju da se desi sto vise stvari.\n\n**Pitanje o igricama i kako gleda na uticaj igara, na decu i tako to.**\n\nDosta je o roditeljima. Dete zaplace i roditelj mu da telefon u ruke i pusti Pepu Prase.Kao i sve ostalo, doci ce nam glave ako preterujemo o tome.Ali razvijaju kognitivne sposobnosti i kreativnosti. \n**Diskusija o stetnosti video igara.**\n\n**Pitanje o tome koliko uziva u igricama ili to gleda uglavnom profesionalno?**\n\nIgra svako vece sa drustvom i dere se i obozava igre!Kancelarija mu je prepuna igracaka.\nNervira ga tako kad igra pucacinu pa stane u cosak da vidi kako je to profesionalno uradjeno.\n\n**Pitanje o tome kad bi pravio nekomercijalnu igricu, sta bi pravio?**\n\nLako ga je zainteresovati ga za kvalitetne stvari.. Potpuno mu je nebitno da li je nesto komercijalno ako je kvalitetno.Koliko god da ga nesto ne interesuje kad pocne da postavlja pitanja i interesuje se odmah mu pada na pamet kako to da se uradi bolje i optimizuje.\nJedna je ta umetnicka stvar o svetu o kome je kroz zivot mastao.\nDruga stvar jeste malo komercijalna ali ne zato sto je komercijalna nego zato sto bi voleo da je uradi visoko kvalitetno.\n\n\n-Dusan prica o odluci da li da detetu od 6 godina uzme tablet i dilemi o uticaju toga na nju.\nTablet je hipnoticka stvar.\nI pre tableta je isto bilo sa crtacima. Uros je kao klinac gledao Gulivera na repeat iako nije znao engleski.\nDeca masovno ne citaju, jer ne moraju da citaju, jer su non stop na telefonima\n\u201cSvi su na tabletima a ja njima moram na tabli da objasnjavam, imaju paznju 5min\u201d\n\n**Sa koliko informacija barataju danas klinci u odnosu na nase roditelje?**\n\nDosta se skroluje, paznju privuku junk informacije.\nPredivno je sto na Youtube mozes da vidis bilo sta o bio cemu.\nAli greska moze da bude sto ljudi misle da znaju nesto o tome zato sto su videli dve stvari na Youtubeu\nOd \u201ckakvo ce vreme biti sutra\u201d do toga \u201ckoja je 4. zena henrija osmog\u201d -> o internetu i moru informacija\nKnjiga je bila jedini medijum, sad postoje mnogi drugi medijumi koji su dostupni.\nKnjiga je jednosmerna, kao i TV, nema sad da ti nju menjas. Sa igricama postoji interakcija. Samo je pitanje koliko su kvalitetne informacije.\nKeva je pocela da koristi internet umesto TVa jer TV njoj kaze sta ona da gleda a na internetu ona bira, prati svoja interesovanja. Interesuje je \u201cbasta\u201d i ukuca i onda gleda to umesto da joj budu servirane infromacije.\n\n-Tamarina cerka je naucila da pise i to sa 5 godina da bi mogla da bira sta gleda na youtube, nije bila zadovoljna time sto joj je servirano.\nDusanov klinac drugi razred je prijavio da ume da prilagodi svoj video da bude 480p.\n\n**(Pauza za rucak)**\n![109A0044|690x460](upload://ox8Zz1BWq8SO7muz2022Ue7iedU.jpeg) \n**Ucesnici se dele u 3 grupe i diskutuju medju sobom.**\n\n**1.Kako koristiti zajednicu za ostvarenje projekta**\n@Ginja @n0vakovic @Natasa @jasen_lakic    \n![109A0038|690x460](upload://8YXzwkaMxtpQzCq41acwgcaA10a.jpeg) \nGradjenjem kolektivne inteligencije i upotrebom volje za saradnju, razumevanje i pomaganje.

Bolje 20 krivih na slobodi nego jedan nevin osudjen na smrt.\nSvaki covjek ima osnovna ljudska prava, cak i oni koje mrzimo, silovatelji, ubice itd.\n\n**Primjer Norvezana:** 20 god max kazna zatvora, moze da se produzi za jos malo ako poces rehabilitacije jos traje i nije zavrsen. Cak i poslje Breivika , oni taj zakon nisu promjenili i gleda se da se takvi ljudi rehabilituju a ne da se zaborave u zatvoru pod maksimalnom zastitom da ih svijet vise nikad ne vidi.\n\nNajvaznija stvar je stvaranje grupa i poslje spajanje tih grupa, tako se organizuju ljudi i predstavljaju mocan entitet koji konkretno moze da napravi neke promjene\n\nLjudi misle da su nemocni, osjecaju se odvojeni od svih i ne zele preuzeti rizik, izaci iz svoje komfort zone. Ljudi vise vole da gledaju druge nego sebe. Ne pitaju se \u201csta ja imam od moci i resorsa, sta ja mogu da uradim, kako mogu da pomognem\u201d.\n\n**Da li postoji lak nacin da se saznaju ljudska prava?** \nMnogi bi da ih znaju ali ako treba da citaju strane i strane teksta onda odustanu brzo. Da li postoji serija online videa koji ljudima objasnjavaju ljudska prava.\nPostoji mini serijal gdje poznate licnosti u videima od 5 min pricaju o ljudskim pravima\n\nTesko je danas biti aktivista, osudjivan si, tucen si, kaznjavan na razne nacine...i familija te se odrice.\n\nKad se gleda zvanicni narativ diplomatije zemalja bivse Jugoslavije, izgleda kao da postoje razne paralelne stvarnosti i da bilo koja od tih moze da se desi i da cak izgleda logicno. Iako su one medjusobno sizofrene u neku ruku...suprotne.\n\nE cilj je da nasa stvarnost pobijedi, da pojede ostale stvarnosti.\n\n**Dusan i Dusan, Marka Zvaka**\n![109A0074|690x460](upload://ohMYdNqU0wnD5opoAfyKAIqNreh.jpeg) \n@MarkaZvaka \nMi provodimo veliki dio vremena sa ljudima na marginama drustva. Kamera je neka vrsta barijere ili medijuma izmedlju tih ljudi i nas. Gledajuci ih kroz objektiv, njihove teske price ne uticu toliko jako na nas. Mi smo glumac i alkoholni tehnicar, ujedno smo i novinari. To cime se mi bavimo nema stabilne i redovne prihode. Zato nam je jako tesko funkcionisati, nemamo finansijsku sigurnost i moramo da radimo po 4 posla da bi se odrzali.\n\nNajvise nam vremena nam oduzimaju drustvene mreze, na sve strane smo i da bi zadrzali komunikaciju sa svim tim ljudima na razlicitim mrezama mi trosimo izuzetno puno vremena.\nDobili smo predlog da uzmemo nekoga da radi samo na pola radnom vremena, studenta koji bi bio voljan da radi tako nesto. Idealno on bi se brinuo za sve drustvene medije.\n\nKroz svaku mrezu se komunicira na drugi nacin, u drugoj formi. Sve se pojednostavljuje, na drustvenim mrezama su informacije koje se sire sve krace. Mi titlamo klipove zato sto oko 70% svih klipova se gledaju bez zvuka. Velika razlika sad u komunikaciji sa nasim gledaocima je da sad oni nama javljaju sta bi mogli da uradimo i puni su ideja.\n\nMi stalno ucimo nove stvari, nove aparate, nove programe...potrebno je konstantno uciti. Mi ne volimo bas drustvene mreze ali mladi koriste najvise drustvene mreze.\n\nJako je lijep efekat kad tako ljudi koji su nesrecni ili u teskoj situaciji zbog toga sto su bili u nasem klipu budu srecniji zato sto njihova okolina to sazna i onda ih gledaju u drugacijem svijetlu. To i nas usrecava, da vidimo pozitivne efekte nasih klipova.\n\nNajvazniji su pozitivni prakticni primjeri, a ne da se zalimo u nasim klipovima. Vazno je pokazati ljudima sta moze da se uradi tako da se mi fokusiramo na svijetle primjere a ne na kukanje. Svako moze da se zali i toga vec ima previse oko nas.\nQ&A\n**Kako izgleda proces iza kamera? Pre i posle emitovanja.**\nObicno nas ljudi kontaktiraju i onda odlucujemo da li cemo praviti reportazi ili ne. Dosta puta se desi da bismo voleli da i posle emitovanja ponovo snimimo iste ucesnike da vidimo sta se kasnije desilo. Nekada to i uradimo, ali u principu se retko vracamo dva puta na istu pricu.\n**Da li vam se desilo da vas zovu da snimate nesto ali da je to ipak previse bizarno ili naporno?**\nPozvani smo da snimimo tacno mesto gde se kanalizacija uliva u reku. Verovatno cemo ici ali nam se ne ide da se vozimo kroz smrad i uzas.\n\n**Zakljucak:**\n\n**Moglo bi se reci da nije bilo glavne teme oko koje su se ljudi okupili i oko koje su diskutovali. Ipak je ovo bilo prvo okupljanje oko platforme EgdeRyders i ljudi su uglavnom dosli da vide o cemu se radi. Teme su se uglavnom ticale situacije u zemlji, opste i sire teme. Dotakli smo se preduzetnistva u Srbiji, ljudskih prava, stresa na radnim mestima i mentaliteta koji ne podrzava promene i rizike.**\n\n**Osecalo se da su prisutni ljudi sa nekom slicnom energijom i vizijom. Slicnih interesovanja, obrazovanja, oni koji su malo misfits u svojoj okolini. Stekao se utisak kao da se svi od ranije poznaju(iako nije bio taj slucaj) jer je atmosfera bila opustena, sa smehom, svi su ucestvovali i svi su imali sansu da se izraze i obrate, diskutuju i postavljaju pitanja.**\n\n**Komunikacija je bila tecna, jednostavna i jasna.

Over time, non-government organisations developed to deal with issues that the state was unable (or unwilling) to handle. This way of thinking is still existing mainly in post soviet countries, where every change is possible only if this is done by the government and only the government can decide whether you can do any project or no or only the government projects could be considered as successful (well, that's what the majority thinks). More recently, the private sector began to contribute to the solution of social, environmental and other issues through corporate social responsibility. And the most recent development is the social entrepreneurship. Despite the traditional charity organisations which spend money on the social value, SEs are trying to have a social impact. In other words, the enterprise has two objectives: generate the financial return and deliver social benefit.\n\n**Isn\u2019t every business a social enterprise?**\n\nAlmost every business, for sure contributes to the economic growth of the country by paying taxes, creating workplaces etc. By creating workplaces they influence people\u2019s well-being. So, isn\u2019t every business a social enterprise. The answer, in my opinion, is \u201cno\u201d.\n\nMost social enterprises compete with regular businesses. So that we do not get confused, we need to understand what was the purpose or mission of the company/organisation/foundation/startup etc by the time of its creation. Moreover, the social enterprise should solve the social problems of vulnerable groups or those who have been left out of mainstream solutions. Instead, the traditional types of business which care financial values, social enterprises contribute to the social impact. \n\n**What we have\u2026**\n\nThere is no defined legal framework for SEs in Armenia. They are registered as foundations, nongovernmental organisations or private limited liability companies. Nowadays the legislation allows foundations to engage in economic activity, invest, apply for the grants etc. If it\u2019s an LLC, the SE as a business can no longer apply for grant funding.\n\nCurrently, there are no privileges in being an SE (e.g. there are no fiscal benefits attached to the legal forms used by SEs) - thus SEs need to compete in the market like any other business. This often creates extra barriers as on top of the challenges of generating profit, the businesses also need to ensure that profit does not come at the expense of the social objective. For the most part, SEs are treated the same way as mainstream businesses when approaching banks or investors. So the biggest challenge is that the social enterprises compete with regular businesses.\n\nOfficials consider the SEs as traditional business projects.\n\nAlmost all the SEs in Armenia were supported by international and local organisations in Armenia. Most of the donor support was dedicated to the seed level. In this case of sustainability is under a question mark.\n\nThere are two SEs that achieved national scale: these are [Dasaran.am](https://www.dasaran.am/apps/s/about) - an online school environment that connects all schools across Armenia in a unified virtual platform, with a community of nearly one million users, including school children, parents, teachers, and principals and [The Homeland Development Initiative Foundation](http://www.hdif.org/our-history/). Its non-profit effort is dedicated to the creation of jobs for women in the regions of Armenia by utilising their traditional handicraft techniques and materials.\n\nThe rest didn\u2019t go further than their towns. Most of them even didn\u2019t succeed. \n\nAs the mapping of SEs in Armenia is already created by Impact Hub Yerevan, I am just putting the link [here](https://goo.gl/g57E0b). If you have any question concerning any of them, just let me know. \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/473a95c0d8222ce7454788fce46a30bdbe9d0cbe.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c9a627bd060bd64620e9da8604e56203fde0876d.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"282\">", "created_at": "2017-08-08 08:10:45.682445", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 16:32:24.022879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 713, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 1562.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34932, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6784, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Wow, it's a good thread!

And we need to be able to weave all these expressions, like I am now weaving the words that I have learnt, to make new meaning.\n\nSo, this was a long winded way of motivating why I am very excited by Holochain for creating a human internet. Not because it couldn't be done by other people, other protocols or in another way, but because the driving force behind the project is fully set on transcending the scarce reality of the monetary environment. Turning a world of transactions into a world of interconnected flows and people. \n\nSure enough Holochain is not THE framework for EVERYTHING. Lots of applications require different tech but at its core it is, in my view, deeply human and respectful of human integrity in the way it allows for you storing your data until you decide you want to share something with someone, just like you do with your everyday experience as well as enabling as few as two people to start using a new app together with no involvement of things like servers.\n\nAgent-centrism also allows for these applications not only to bridge between each other, but to many other systems where you allow the application to act on your behalf. Integration with things like [SSB](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) which is already creating a much more human experience should be easy enough given that they are both offline first, cryptographically signed information exchanges. \n\nAs for actual use right now, in addition to what me and @kristofer [built](https://github.com/kristoferlund/holochain-logistics) I have one more application [prototyped](https://github.com/zaunders/MailBoox-rust) and a few more designed, but there is still a lot of changes going on in the [core framework](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust) so things are breaking a lot. A few more months until apps see daily use I am guessing. \n\nAnyway, sorry for ranting, but the efforts for open-source \"_organizing the work with these common challenges as a society_\" are very much front and center in the Holochain/Metacurrency community as far as I can tell.", "created_at": "2019-04-24 08:26:32.313766", "updated_at": "2019-04-24 08:34:08.474009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 121.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [52759], "is_liked_by": [4685, 4022, 5040, 5119, 5400, 5604], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67370, "user_id": 5647, "topic_id": 12084, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@zvanstanley, thanks for the feedback.

Precisely because of that, I have decided that I will sit in the resilience session: a great chance to learn something new.\u00a0\n\nWhat fascinates me in the resilience discourse (for what i understand, which is not much) is the assumption of self-reliance as the default state - what you call the McGyver approach. We must make do with what we have. In the unusual situation of actually being able to make a choice, the resilient thing to do is the simplest and most economical. Electric cars? Bah, expensive toys that require extensive infrastructure. Christiania bikes? Now you're talking.\u00a0\n\nSo, I would propose we a <strong>resilient-a-thon</strong>, and we do it around the theme of <strong>cyclability and walkability</strong>. A resilient-a-thon is a word I just made up for some collective hacking action meant to increase resilience. It means: <strong>assume zero budget</strong> and <strong>produce actionable ideas</strong> that would make walking and cycling in Europe more attractive forms of mobility. It is super-resilient, because it assumes only minimal infrastructure and no backer with funding; it takes advantage of the extreme diversity of the Edgeryders community (biking in the Maastricht is not the same as in Warsaw), that can help troubleshoot solutions in the light of what goes on all the different places; and we can pick the best two-three ideas for the reporting session.\u00a0\n\nAlso: I have used my superadminpowers to assign this mission not only to \"Help build the June conference\", but also to the Resilience session team. If you go to the home page and scroll down, you should now see this report is visible from there. I also tagged it with the tag \"resilience\".

He's very capable of processing vast amounts of complex information in multiple languages - even for him it was difficult to discern what the different political parties are about and the implications of voting for them. \n\nI told him I prioritise information politics in this round of elections. More specifically political representatives I can trust to fight against breaking net neutrality, against online surveillance and censorship and copyright. I pointed to our having to know what is happening in order to be able to defend our other rights. Connecting this to the implications of internet acces/access to information in the ongoing uprising against military dictatorship in Sudan ( see #sudanuprising on twitter). He *got* it immediately.\n\nI believe you need to find connections between what is happening in the society where people currently live, and the places where they have cultural or historical ties. The dynamics of divisiveness and authoritarianism are fairly similar I think and if described in terms that connect the issues and struggles.  Making a more sopisticated/nuanced connection to how these ideologies affect geopolitics and the effect on people's everyday lives in both locations. Children of the diaspora are generally well equipped to do this. Especially if we are well connected with people of our generation that were born and raised \"back home\" as seen from our parents' perspectives. BUT, this is if we ourselves are engaged and informed.\n\nI feel an important challenge here is getting people to look beyond the rhetoric and really understanding the foundations of how society works in order to make wise decisions. And honestly, I think non-minority groups underestimate curiosity and willingness to learn amongst minority communities. Study circles, lectures, webinars  etc.- easily accessible resources for about learning how ones societies work. They need not to be patronising and contents need to live up to standards of intellectual integrity.\n\nFor me Sudan and Ethiopia are closer, but I have seen these dynamics play out in Sweden. @youel is of an older generation and has lived in multiple parts of the world during key phases and was never engaged in politics as far as I know.  @jasen_lakic has also shared some experiences of dealing with these dynamics.", "created_at": "2019-05-31 10:02:58.444261", "updated_at": "2019-05-31 10:02:58.444261", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 82.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 1856, 5158], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32415, "user_id": 2787, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>FB event, online tools and stuff</b>\n\nYeah, we will have time next week to talk.

And if people think that that helps people to appropriately evaluate the meaning of the information or if that might also lead them astray in another way, as of course, your understanding is much less objective.\n[/quote]\nThat's a very good point, but I actually think it may be the case that the biggest problem is when you haven't yet confronted the reality of a situation in a personal way; I think a lot of the problems many people have when trying to come to terms with anything traumatic is that we don't want to accept that it is happening or can be happening, in a way, running away from our feelings. So to the contrary I don't think feelings necessarily make us less objective; wanting to ignore or minimize our feelings, deny them -- I think that's what causes the greatest distortion of perception and thought. Just my personal view.\n\nThis is a really sad story but I am reminded of a letter I read a couple weeks ago to an advice columnist, from a parent who was annoyed that their partner wanted to send their daughter to a child care club organized by other parents during the lockdown. Despite misgivings, they ended up sending their child. The advice columnist said that this was not a little wrong, it was BIG wrong. Just yesterday I read the follow up letter -- all the children came down with COVID, including their daughter, even though they had only sent her for one day and pulled her after the first day. Multiple children were going to the hospital, one of whom had preexisting conditions and was in dire condition, and they were all so regretful. It's such a horrific story yet part of the problem was before this happened many of these parents were just not really in touch with the potential very visceral reality of this situation we are all in. In fact it took the personal experience to bring the full reality of it to the forefront for them.\n\n[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:14, topic:12845, full:true\"]\nI was wondering if maybe this  \"Infodemic Design challenge\" posted by @daveed would be interesting for you? \"simplifying knowledge\" is one of the intents, but designing for critical thinking **and** low barrier information processing in parallel is probably the right way to go.\n[/quote]\nI'm very interested in this.

What 'hides' behind the concept and whether it is more of an object, relationships and practices, or desired outcomes is actually in the eye of the beholder... So the beholder will relate to the commons through the dimension of it that speaks directly to him.\n\nWhat I like in the concept of commons is that you can 'nudge' or 'funnel' many views of sustainability towards a more complete and whole concept of commons and commoning by working on the overlaps and adjacencies.

So I can exclude that this is because the `Api-Key:` header would get lost during the proxying.\n\nThe error, as tested with the above simple `curl` GET query for an access protected topic, does not happen on our more recent Discourse installation running the Communities sites.

(Was a stupid mistake from me actually to forget it, but the fact that I need to make a paper that allows me to leave the country is the point.) And had to go back to Cairo from Hurghada Airport to bring the paper from the assigned office, but this is not the story here. \n\nDuring the OpenVillage project, we had our share of this mess, with most of the participants traveling form the southern Mediterranean region not being able to get the visa on time for the festival in Brussels, including @zmorda who is part of the OpenVillage team, most of the people attended had already a visa or a residency or another passport, or were lucky and got the visa on time. \n\nNow with Morocco, @bishoyabd can't travel from Egypt for example as he is a student in the final year and not allowed to travel till graduation (our program doesn't fit the only exception that was set which is participating in an international competition).\n\nI am not lucky myself till now with the Moroccan bureaucracies, although I am kinda experienced dealing with the Egyptian and German bureaucracies, starting with realizing in August that the embassy in Egypt only opens 2 days a week for 2 hours and realizing that I won't get the visa on time,  then applying in the embassy in Berlin, it took time because apparently this is a new situation for them; _Egyptian working as a freelancer in Germany with a company that is not based in Germany going to stay in Morocco without a Moroccan company or entity directly involved_, it took time and several visits always with more papers, till finally getting the visa for 3 months but from the date of issue not during the dates that I actually asked for, this made it only 2 months and one week. \n\nThen Eposide III in Morocco, in this had @matthias  with my companion as well, after knowing which office to get the forms and which one to apply for, where o fcourse asked for more papers and copies finally applied got a paper proving that we applied where we had to sign in person and we thought that is it, that's kinda easy if you know what papers to bring and thought we should document this online as we couldn't find any clear info online. ( but we were wrong ) \n\n2 days before my visa finishes they realized that we still need more papers, one of them is impossible to be done, tried a work around on my last day but also didn't work. I believe this is because also this is an unusual situation so they didn't check the rules or it is just done on the spot depending on the situation. \n\nSo here I am with all my copies, health certificate, Moroccan bank account and have to leave the country early in the morning, luckily found a cheap flight to Germany so I can apply for another one and come back.\n\nEposide IV: The story didn't finish yet in Morocco, was very close not to board the plane because again this is not a usual situation for the costumes office. \n\nChecking my passport, things seemed fishy for them, Egyptian passport, staying for 2 months in Morocco which is admittedly long period for an average Egyptian to have as a \u201cvacation\u201d, and traveling to Europe, this residency permit should not be correct. ( specially that I don't have a \u201cstamp\u201d entering Europe in this new passport ) \n\nAfter some long \u201cchatting\u201d on why and where I live in Morocco and Germany, since internet was not working for some reason there was not good reception in their office so I couldn't show them the boarding pass  entering Morocco they asked for. Luckily since I don't really have any permanent \u201chome\u201d I always travel with all my papers ( literally all, I filter them every now and then \u2013 I also mainly travel with all my belongings in my backpack ) so I found a receipt from the Moroccan embassy in Germany stating that I paid money to get the visa, this was kinda convincing so I was able to board the plane.\n\nNow in Berlin again applied for a visa, this time was prepared with all the required papers,  and waiting for their answer, of course no one gave me an exact date but I hope things go faster this time so I can be back as soon as possible. \n\nTraveling with an Egyptian passport is not a smooth process normally, As @HadeerGhareeb  once mentioned, _yes being a \u201cglobal citizen\u201d is good and all, but we can't be like this with our passports._ Since no one is expecting a major change soon in the boarders visa issues and  with  a lot of Egyptians from my generation out of the country now and traveling around I hope things get smoother, this could be done by exchanging tips  and sharing our experiences.\n\nMeanwhile, I hope all things are ok in the house, sending my love and \"envy\" from the cloudy cold Berlin. \n\n\n**P.S.:** Would like to share with you some moments from my journey \n\nDuring the journey of passing by most of the gov buildings in Essaouira,  one can  encounter some funny comments, my favorite till now  was \u201c _this booking is in English_ ( yes I made an online booking in a hotel for some reason ) _we need it in French or Arabic_, but then wait comes a better one, \u201c_we need also the owner of the hotel to come with you  as well_\u201d.

Data re-usability and interoperability under the FAIR principle recommends storing data in standard form; but, as we know, ethnography has not yet developed an open standard for data exchange. We have to fall back on a generic standard. \n\nTo a first approximation, I see two candidates.\n\n1. Open Knowledge's [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/). This has the advantage of being far and away the simplest.\n1. The guidelines of the [Text Encoding Initiative](https://tei-c.org/). It is an XML standard aiming to make any text interoperable with any other text. This is achieved by tagging parts of the text: for example, when the text contains parts that are in a language other than the main language of the text, these parts are bracketed by a `foreign` tag. \n\n> John eats a `<foreign xml:lang=\"fr\">`croissant`<foreign>` every morning.\n\nI am tempted to discard the TEI as horribly expensive and irrelevant.\n\nIt is horribly expensive because someone would have to study closely all the text and mark it with all sorts of tags. For example, questions are to marked with the `q` tag. There is some conversion software: the main one seems to be [Oxgarage](https://github.com/TEIC/oxgarage), which is actively maintained and can do conversions from certain types of files to TEI. It is, however, very far from intuitive. So, at the very least there would be quite some work to set Oxgarage up and shout at it until it works. \n\nAnd it is irrelevant because it was started in 1994 (with the semantic web fad raging on), and the website seems to indicate that it never really caught on. So, I do not think we would get much extra interoperability for all that work. \n\n@amelia, @Richard, @Jan: do you agree? Is TEI-compliance a big requirement in your fields?", "created_at": "2019-06-17 10:53:33.883576", "updated_at": "2019-06-17 10:53:33.883576", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 329, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 16.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19826, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1390, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Collecting initiatives that work</b>\n\nHI Gyula,\n\nthanks for opening the space for a conversation around these topics.

Introduction</h2>\n\n_Initial writeup by @matthias, but this is a wiki: welcome to contribute!_\n\nCreating an own, digital Points of Interests map and providing it to everyone else online can be really useful for a community \u2013 community in the widest sense, from groups of nomadic travellers to long-established city neighborhoods:\n\n* The map helps individuals to remember locations, restaurants and shops that they visit only rarely.\n\n* The map creates and spreads collaboratively created knowledge about recommendable local shops and amenities.\n\n* The map introduces visitors to the local economy so that they are not restricted to buying from the big shops that tourists often consider \"safe options\". This, in turn, also supports the local economy against the \"big players\", esp. because in most developing economies the small shops are actually _cheaper_ than the big stores.\n\n* It is a simple form to bring small shops into the digital age: they do not have to create an online shop, instead providing a business name, opening hours, a phone number and a short description will be enough.\n\n* Beyond mapping shops and amenities, such maps can also be useful for many other types of \"points of interest\":\n\n    * foraging (wild fruit trees, herbs, mushrooms, other natural resources like bamboo and stones etc.)\n    * reducing food waste (unused fruit trees on private property that people allow the public to use etc.)\n    * mapping local pollution for trash cleanup days\n    * disaster mapping of damage by flood, earthquakes, storms, wildfires etc.\n    * crisis response mapping (people and what they need)\n\nThe following is a way to create such a map. So far, it is an (incomplete) introduction to [OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/) and [uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/). OsmAnd~ is the best open source map software for Android, and uMap is a free web-based service for collaboratively creating custom maps online. It is completely open source software and uses free map data from OpenStreetMap. As an alternative to uMap, you might also like to try [FacilMap](https://facilmap.org/) \u2013 a very similar tool, also based on OpenStreetMap.\n\nIn the following instructions, we use our [\"Essaouira POIs\" uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_193062) as an example, which we developed during the [OpenVillage House Sidi Kaouki project](/t/id/7898). You should of course create your own map and apply the instructions accordingly.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Using the POI map</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Using the POI map in a browser</h3>\n\n1. Simply open [our uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_193062) in your browser, either on a desktop computer or on a mobile device.\n2. When you open the map initially, a search panel is available on the right-hand side. Type anything there and a search over all names of our POI map markers will be made.\n3. If you close that panel and want to get it back later, you can find it by clicking the \"Map Layers\" icon in the left side column of icons, and then the \"Browse data\" button there.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Using the POI map offline</h3>\n\nThis is useful when travelling, as you don't know if you have a working data connection at all times. It works with all Android devices.\n\n1. Install the \"open source app store\" [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) on your Android phone or tablet. There is a nice [video with installation instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7JVtO8Bopc).\n2. Install the [OsmAnd~ application from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/) by searching for \"OsmAnd\" inside the F-Droid app.\n3. In the app, download the world base layer map and the map for the local area.\n4. Open [our uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_193062) in your mobile device, click the \"Share\" icon on the left side.\n5. Choose \"Download data \u2192 gpx\", click \"Download data\" and save the file in the \"Downloads\" folder.\n6. Switch to OsmAnd~ and go to \"main menu \u2192 My Places\".\n7. Click \"+\" in the lower left corner, select \"Open from \u2192 Downloads\", and select the GPX file from uMap that you just saved. It will be imported into a new \"My Places\" category.\n8. If you went through this process before, you can now hide or delete any categories in \"My Places\" containing previous versions of that GPX file. All that data is still contained in the newest version you just imported.\n9. Use the \"Search\" icon in \"main menu \u2192 My Places\" in OsmAnd~ to find something in our POI map, or just tap on the map markers in your vicinity to see what is around.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Managing and contributing to the POI map</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Creating the POI map</h3>\n\nHere is how to initially set up your own uMap map. Here we use the gratis web service umap.openstreetmap.fr; but uMap is open source software, so if you are determined enough you can also host it on your own server. For small, public mapping projects there is not much reason to do so. (Just always keep a backup of your data \u2013 see chapter 3.4. below \u2013 so you can transition to a self-hosted installation in case the free web service might go away in the future.)\n\n1. Use Firefox as a browser. (There seems to be a bug in Chrome making it hang when changing map security settings. Adding markers to the map etc. is however possible without problems in any browser.)\n\n2. Create an OpenStreetMap account and log in: https://www.openstreetmap.org/login\n\n3. [Visit the English uMap website](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) and create a map.\n\n4. On the right top, click \"Edit Map\", then click the \"Change tilelayers\" icon that appears, and choose \"OpenStreetMap\" there to get rid of the French placenames.\n\n5. Click the key icon (\"Update permissions and editors\") and configure the map to be editable by everyone with the link. (That's the part where Chrome hangs, and even Firefox may take a while. But it works.)\n\n6. Zoom and move the map to focus on the affected area, then click the \"Save this center and zoom\" icon in the right column.\n\n7. Save the map.\n\n8. Copy the map's URL (\"the link\") from your browser's address bar.\n\n9. Optional: Modify your map's URL to make it as short as possible for simple sharing. You can omit the last part looking like `#9/28.0465/83.2324`, and you can replace the title part appearing before the map ID with any sequence of character to shorten it. Your URL would then look very similar to mine, just with a different ID: `http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_162690` Do not forget to try your shortened URL before handing it out!\n\n10. Open an incognito window in your browser and visit your map's URL. Try if you can add a marker successfully without logging in. (The incognito window makes sure you appear to the website as not logged in, even though you may be logged in to the map in another browser window.)\n\n11. Share the map link around to whoever should see or edit it.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Collecting and contributing POI data with the browser</h3>\n\nThis is the most comfortable solution, esp. for adding one or a few points. But obviously it does not work without Internet access (proper mobile network reception, booked Internet package).\n\n1. Simply open [our uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_193062) in your browser, either on a desktop computer or on a mobile device.\n2. Click the \"Enable Editing\" icon in the top right.\n3. Click the \"Draw a marker\" icon in the top right and draw a marker on your map.\n4. In the \"Select the layer of the feature\" dropdown, select the appropriate topic: Medical, Transport, Commercial (shops, restaurants), Money (ATMs, banks and currency exchange) or Misc (for the \"other stuff\"). This automatically assigns the marker color as well.\n5. Enter a name and description. The name should contain everything people might use to search this POI, as the description field is not searchable.\n6. Click \"Shape properties \u2192 Icon symbol \u2192 define\" and select an appropriate white icon.\n7. Click \"Save\" in the top right and wait for the confirmation message.\n8. When you are done with your editing session, click \"Disable editing\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Collecting POI data offline, contributing it with the browser</h3>\n\nThis is preferable when for adding POIs in areas without proper mobile network coverage for Internet access, and also when you use the OsmAnd~ app anyway for navigation and don't want to switch to the browser app to add another POI.\n\n1. This solution uses the same app \"OsmAnd~\" as in the \"Using the POI map offline\" instructions from above, so if you have not yet, install the [OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/) application from F-Droid on your Android device and in the app, download the world base layer map and the Morocco map.\n2. Walk around and when you see a POI that is not yet on our map, long-press the screen in OsmAnd~ at the point's location and create a \"favourite\" marker. Put everything into the title that might be relevant for people searching this, as both in uMap and OsmAnd~ the search only covers the name, not the description. Put supplementary information like shop opening times into the description.\n3. Save that favourite into a category like \"Essaouira POIs 1\", using the next free number.\n4. After some days when you mapped enough and want to put your points on the share map, rename your category to \"Essaouira POIs 1 (in uMap)\".\n5. In \"main menu \u2192 My Places\", go to the three-dots menu of the category to export and click \"Share \u2192 Save as \u2026\". Save it in the \"Downloads\" folder or similar.\n6. Open [our uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_193062) on your mobile device, and click the top-right pencil button to edit the map.\n7. Click the :arrow_up: icon to import data and select the GPX file you just saved. For the layer to import it to, select one named \"by @username\" (using your Edgeryders username). Everyone has their own layer for their own data, which protects against accidental deletion / overwriting etc..\n8. Finalizing your contributed POI data by editing it in a browser. Basically open every POI for editing once, and go along the steps under \"Contributing POI data to the map in a browser\" to set  layer, name, description and symbol according to our conventions in this map.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Creating a backup of the uMap data</h3>\n\nDoing this regularly, esp. after you made sizable edits, protects against data loss by troll activity. Because after all, we have set the map to be publicly editable.\n\n1. Click on the \"Layers\" icon (left side, bottom icon) and make all layers visible. Because a data download will only include currently visible data items.\n2. Click on the \"Share and embed this map\" icon.\n3. Make sure \"Full map data\" is selected as download type, and click \"Download data\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-5\">3.5. Publishing your POI map online</h3>\n\nSince it's using the umap.openstreetmap.fr webservice, your POI map _is_ already online and you only have to share the link. However, there are also ways how to customize it further by embedding it into your own website, and adding pages with information to your website that are linked from the POI points on the map.\n\n_[TODO]_\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Contributing to OpenStreetMap</h2>\n\nWhile you explore the area and add points of interest, you will also encounter cases where the map itself is inaccurate or incomplete. Fortunately, it is OpenStreetMap, so you can edit it.\n\nBelow is a simple process how to efficiently collect this data alongside the Points of Interest so you can contribute it to OpenStreetMap later. We do not cover here _how_ to contribute it to OpenStreetMap: that's a bit technnical but [has good documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Contributing point data to OpenStreetMap</h3>\n\nThis covers the steps of getting point-like data into uMap that are meant for adding them later to OpenStreetMap: POIs, start and end of ways, geolocated user notes meant to help you editing OpenStreetMap later. Actually editing this data into OpenStreetMap is a whole other process not covered in this wiki.\n\nIn short, just follow the process \"Contributing POI data to the map offline\" from above, just that you put the POIs into a favourite category \"OSM Additions\" in OsmAnd~ and import them into a new layer \"@username OSM Additions\" in uMap.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Contributing GPX tracks to OpenStreetMap</h3>\n\nThis covers the steps of getting GPX data into uMap. Getting it from there into OpenStreetMap is a whole other process not covered in this wiki.\n\n1. In the OsmAnd~ app, download and install the GPX logging plugin.\n2. Configure the screen so that the GPX logging button appears in the top right corner.\n3. Click the button to start logging a section.\n4. Click the button again to stop logging a section (the idea is to only log ways that are not on OpenStreetMap yet, avoiding a lot of point editing for splitting them later).\n5. Add a \"favourite\" marker in OsmAnd~ to the start of a section to record information about it for adding it properly to OpenStreetMap later. Put that favourite into a special category \"OSM additions\" or similar.\n6. When you finished your mapping session, click the GPX button again and click \"Save current track\".\n7. Open the uMap [for example our uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_193062)) in Chrome on Android, and go into editing mode.\n8. Click the \":arrow_up:\" icon to import data, select your GPX track, and select a layer \"by @username (OSM Additions)\" as target layer.

What are commonly termed \"Populist\" parties have become significant political players in several countries, including Italy, Holland, Austria, France, UK, and Germany, and their number has almost doubled since 2000 (from 33 to 63) [Eiermann et al. 2018]. \n\nThe POPREBEL research project offers an opportunity for Western Europeans to better understand Central and Eastern Europe, just as it is urgent for the CEE region to focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism at home and elsewhere.\n\n<br>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n## How it works\n\nWe approach this project through the lense of community research -  open participatory research process where both questions and interpretations are shaped together with participants.\n\nThe community research is hosted on edgeryders, an online community of 5000 people in more than 80 countries who share experiences. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. As a consequence of getting to know people from around the world, we connect one another to important information, new ideas and new opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n![98d73fda44c9a276f764d1f2529589de65d2f3d7_2_1035x433|690x288](upload://cY7HZEsIk0nezhLwUIctB42S6cU.jpeg) \n\n\n|Inputs|Platform|Outputs|Outcome|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Committed People|Conversation|Articles|Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves.

About fifteen years ago I realized the agency was on the passport, and key identity management : the issuer, validator, in our case the national state. Because of various reasons I believe that model is gone and breakdown and fragmentation around the corner. There is still some vitality left I believe in the EU as a 500 million zone. In the Digital Transition the war is won in three battles. Europe already lost two, data and platforms. We are on the brink of losing the third: AI hitting Big Data building new services on combinations of temporary identities (chimeras of synthetic material and real people combined, or fully synthetic) that will create  a seamless flow between:\n\nThe BAN (body area network): e.g. the ambient hearing aide, the smart T-shirts, lenses, glasses,\n\nThe LAN (local area network): e.g. the smart meter as a home interface, any consumer device,\n\nThe WAN (wide area network): the bike, car, train, bus, plane\n\nThe VWAN (very wide area network): the smart city as e-government services\n\neverywhere; no longer tied to physical locations or the agency and consent of individual people.\n\nIt is highly likely that monitoring mechanisms will be built into devices themselves: for example, \u201cif a guest is charging their electric car at a friend\u2019s house, we should consider applications that will understand that the charge should appear on the guest\u2019s electric bill and not that of the friend.\u201d (Example from our Springer book Enabling Things to Talk: Designing IoT solutions with the IoT ...\n\n[https://books.google.be/books?isbn=3642404030](https://books.google.be/books?isbn=3642404030)\n\nAlessandro Bassi, \u200eMartin Bauer, \u200eMartin Fiedler - 2013 - \u200eComputers\n\n... Thorsten Kramp, Rob van Kranenburg, Sebastian Lange, Stefan Meissner ... that the charge should appear on the guest's electric bill and not that of the friend. ... 16http://[tools.ietf.org/id/draft-roychowdhury-6lowappsip-00.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-roychowdhury-6lowappsip-00.txt) tagged items or \u2026)\n\nNow we should pool all skillsets and intelligences into building a 500 million zone architecture that creates the opportunities for  building value with datasets and new services in a coherent, safe, secure and privacy preserving way in an EU governance that is techno-political.. The governance of that pragmatic cybernetics is something you/we  should be focusing on, not on creating individual pathways for people to decouple from commercial services, in a time where society itself as we know it is a breaking point.\n\nI received an invitation (as founder of one of the largest IOT networks, [theinternetofthings.eu](http://theinternetofthings.eu))  to talk about Internet of Things from the GFF 'and the Italian Intelligence community', Transformational Technologies #4: Implications for an Expanding Threat Environment September 17-18, 2012 Rome, Italy. In the afternoon five breakout groups (senior intelligence, police and military, SOCA, CIA, MI6, Homeland Security...) came back with five scenarios of major threats: one was military, two were about DIY Bio and two were about the 'total breakdown of society', because of the inability of current institutions to deal with the digital. It was quite crazy to see my own breakdown scenario of 2000 played back by institutional analysts.\n\nThis is now 7 years ago.\n\nThe trouble with the kind of thinking that I propose is that it has always been seen, from Cybersin by Stafford Beert to the current Chinese credit system, as a system of top down control, whereas I (and Stafford Beer himself) have always focused on the transparency that is brought by realtime sensor streams (albeit having its own bias of course) and the freedom entailed in power structures having to relate to blockchain type of incorruptible decision making instead of ego, raw power, chance, ideology, religion\u2026\n\nWe do not need solutions in which an individual tries to go more cloaked and cloaked into a fully commercial world no longer protected by the democratic state (regulate and fine become weaker and weaker tools in  societies in economic crisis for over thirty years and missing out on the financial rewards because of not owning g the drivers, but regulating the repercussions like in GDPR) and the social middle as that is gone and going. Instead all our tools should be deployed in a systematic approach with a governance that like ICANN grew alongside the internet, and now should actualize around Internet of Things, a true Next Generation Internet means decision making is taken to that level. Of course this sounds like the Borg, the Matrix, the Chinese social credit system. But we, you, are too smart to buy that.\n\nWe need an inclusive identity framework that is able to name, validate and build services on identities that will become a process between a device/controller of some kind  (now smart phone), services (energy, mobility\u2026) and the architecture 5G hardware for example).\n\nThat capability should be European.\n\nIt does four things:\n\nIt explodes identity as a single unit: in this ides (Zenroom running as VM on a chip on \u2018device\u2019 on billions of SIM cards  - in washing machines, lamps,, cars\u2026 and in 5G base stations and other infrastructure) turning identity into a process and allowing people to have thousands of temporary identities (just when they use a service)\n\nIt gradually fades out Facebook, Google..\n\nIt creates European services through EU unified protocols that could be locally permission less deployed, thus winning us the third battle (as we don\u2019t care where the \u2018original\u2019 data resides)\n\nIt restores European dignity, a vital b belief in our agency to build meaningful and value creating infrastructures which is what (though)leaders like you should do.", "created_at": "2019-07-11 08:56:49", "updated_at": "2019-07-11 08:58:39.785953", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 972, "wiki": false, "reads": 50, "score": 100.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56505], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2915, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13639, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4286, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Online space for dialogue</b>\n\nWe did not get a set of challenges to crowdsource the solutions for.

Regardless, here we are.  Smart regulation by entities that truly understand what it is they are trying to regulate would get us closer to where we should be (compared to having companies maintain their nanny-state control), but it can never fix what I see as a core problem of the mass spread of disinformation: lack of curiosity as to what is and is not true.  \n\nHowever, while it is political suicide for any elected official to assign blame or responsibility to the electorate, the rest of us can do it.  Because what can any society do about people who want to believe things that are demonstrably false?  If people have the tools to find out and don't use them, should the rest of us be penalized?  And to me it is a penalty to have been in this business for 34 years and see the tech be so much better but the user experience be so much worse when it comes to individual free choice.\n\nMy daughter has kids age 7 and 9.  Those kids are quite media savvy for sure, and I believe there is greater burden now on a parent helping their kids navigate through this soup of information and disinformation.  But it is still their responsibility more than the state or some corporation.  At least I hope they see it that way, because the alternative to my view is a doubling down of today's problems.\n\nI admit that while I have been thinking about this issue for a long time, my thoughts are still not fully baked.  I just know that I am capable of handling my own information inflow, just as I was before these titans of tech assigned for themselves the role of gatekeeper.  I don't need someone shutting off my access to 8Chan or anything else.  And I find it inappropriate and offensive that any CDN would curtail that access.  Same with Nazi stuff. What if I want to see what they are up to directly?  Why should I not be able to do that?  Again, the problem to me is not so much that one can see it. The problem is that someone doesn't know enough, or have enough ways to see that such sites spew hateful bile.\n\nNow designing and creating a comprehensive toolkit for a user to more smartly manage the inflow of content, would be difficult and expensive.  But ad hoc censoring is no answer.  And while a government can mandate ownership of one's data and privacy, helping people create and develop a good reliable BS detector is a far taller order.  But like I said above, I do not see how any vision of a 'human centered Internet' can be realized without it.", "created_at": "2020-08-22 20:04:35.845286", "updated_at": "2020-08-22 20:11:04.875390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 494, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82192], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59424, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 117, "raw": "Looks good but I ask you to please not collect so much private data about people.

It is a sign of prestige for the shop exhibiting it (like the tourist guide stickers). \n**WHY?** It is impossible to recognise the shop accessible via temporary ramp if no sign is present.\n\n* **a doorbell with improved usability:** the custom doorbell has the sticker on it that identifies the project. Dioniso receives a visual feedback when his call is received by Minerva. \n**WHY?** The ad-hoc doorbell highlight the fact that Dioniso is welcomed in the shop.\n\n* **a custom device to receive the doorbell call:** Minerva receives a notification on a portable device, which can produce light, vibrate and/or sound. By pressing a button on the device, Minerva can notify Dioniso that the call was received and will shortly go out with the ramp.\n**WHY?** A device with a single feature is more reliable than an app. It can be used by multiple people running the shop.\n\n* **a smartphone app to ask for assistance when you are in front of a shop:** A device (fitted with beacon technology) advertises the presence of an accessible shop. Dioniso receives a notification on his smartphone and he can call for assistance if in the range of the shop.\n**WHY?** People with limited arm movement capabilities can use smartphones fitted with ad hoc controllers (e.g. vocal controller).\n\nSo now it\u2019s time to develop the final prototypes in order to be ready for the user testing phase!\nStay tuned :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-08-01 11:05:25.921192", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 16:21:26.158224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 395, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 121.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80791, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14061, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Back when I was traveling a lot having a garden didn't make good sense.

Like, without compromising the freshness of the ideas?\n\n<span>I think Edgeryders should seek funding for projects that were born from our collectivity, what we are passionate about, but also act as umbrella for its members' individual projects.. as a network of support : meaning that if for example James and the people in Access Space are doing something, Edgeryders as organization would be involved as well, or help in any way we can..</span>\n\n<span>And lastly for now, I don't know about a board of 'directors', but definitely<strong> in favor of a core group taking at least a minimum lead, but not closed and based on volunteering (at least in the beginning)</strong>: doing administrative work and strategic planning, centralization of what is going on in the different corners of Europe where Edgeryders are based to ensure visibility of their projects at community level, after all some sort of community managers..\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-09 17:08:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.561191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 85.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 8, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20370, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2744, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>a very hot topic indeed</b>\n\nhello kohar\n\n<span>I really want to know the scale of the approved project ? is it just to be in the uni or will it be implemented in some informal areas or experimenting in some different places ?</span>\n\n<span>and what about the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NoCoal\">Anti-Coal movment</a> are u or any of ur students involved in this <span>? for the non-Egyptians this movment is against building electric power stations that works with coal that some smart guys in the \"decision making \" place wants to start building</span></span>\n\n<span>also there is a group called<span> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/biogas.people/\">biogas people</a></span> - I think they already know about STF , I'll make sure:) - no<span>w they cooperate with GIZ and Icecairo , are they involved somehow in ur project or within the students or they are a separate thing , anyway I think they might add to the discusion</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\nand just a personal\u00a0 comment on the old discussion @Nadia : please don't try to get something done with the government now it will just get a bad reputation :D:D as there was something about the ambassador of Sweden will discuss cooperation chances with the new ministry ........\n\n---------\n\nFinally I just remembered something I thought sharing it her in this post would be appropriate<span> about that guy in elzabaleen (the garabage collectors ) who had the project of biogas containers on roof tops in order to get energy for the hot water needed , there was a report about him I think in Aljazeera I will search for the link , I got the chance actually to meet his wife 2 years ago and asked her about what happened to his project why I wasn't sacled up she just told me that after making the proposal for the government to get\u00a0 funds and get the project into action , the answer he got from the authoroty figure was \" Y DO U GUYS IN EL ZABALEEN NEED HOT WATER FOR ANYWAY ? \"\u00a0 and of course nothing\u00a0 has been done , I actually don't know if there was any further steps done after that or not as the we have seen lots of ministries afterwards but I don't think so</span>\n\nso what do u think about that story : and what other obstacles do u think\u00a0 face such projects\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-16 17:52:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.423303", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 511, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2053], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47191, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 9005, "post_number": 23, "raw": "Quite relevant.

Change starts at the individual, individuals like you from where we hope it spreads like an oil spot at sea\u2026.I realize the irony in this phrase \ud83d\ude0a\u2026\n\nPeople in general care first about themselves and their closed environments, hopefully to pay attention to the rest of the world afterwards in order to make things better for everyone. Take myself as an example\u2026.This is the first time you see me react to a post\u2026.this is because I am on vacation, having the time to read stuff that is on the internet from my network. I spend my days working for a big capitalist company, making a decent living. The industry I am working for makes an awful lot of money from a primary need, I know this and try to compensate through ScimPulse, but in essence I am just \u201c as bad\u201d as everybody else but with the effort of trying to mitigate. First me and my surroundings, then the rest of the world\u2026..it\u2019s a mentality\nIt is just this that is also drawing my attention from this post and you briefly touched it\u2026\u2026.we seem to care only for the \u201cWestern\u201d part of this world. We see I don\u2019t know how much footage about rampages in US and Europe\u2026even some on Mexico but not nearly as much as from the US or other rich Western countries\u2026..close to home..anyway in the same cluster of welfare. It is not a contest but the impact and casualties in other parts of the world, caused by same or different catastrophes are much, much worse. \n \n \n \ni.e. Bangladesh flooding\u2019s, earth slides in China, Inida, parts of south America\u2019s, starvation in Africa, mass killings in Africa and Eastern part of the world, political repression and imprisonment even in Turkey (where we don\u2019t have the guts to stand up due to political/economical interests), the remainders/consequences of Arabic spring (and I believe this is also part of what you try to point out Faruqh, when you argue oppose\u2026.will come back to this later\ud83d\ude09). Like you mentioned, those which are impacted the most, are those from we western capitalist greedy society is taken the most advantage\nWith Open Care I believe we try to touch the lives of many by trying to organize care in such a way that more will benefit and it stays sustainable towards the future\u2026\u2026We try to make better and preserve what we have\u2026.what about the people deprived of care? I hope we also can have the discussion on how we can get care to those which are deprived of what we have\u2026we seem to care first of our own ecosystem\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a mentality\nPerhaps our first point of attention should be to mitigate the differences in the world instead of making better what we have\u2026..? I know, this is a very blunt statement, but consider, for a large part we harvest the consequences of \u201cus\u201d exploiting those countries which suffer the most now\u2026\u2026\nPerhaps what we learn in this project could also be of benefit when we try to solve these kind of utterly questions\u2026\u2026.There must be a correlation between prosperity and individualism (read, not having community care)\u2026Take Europe for example, starting at the South of Europe, where there is a lot more of community care, traveling to the North and take for instance The Netherlands, my home country. No way, I am going to take care of my parents in my home. Not because I don\u2019t love them\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026..I am too busy to take care of my own closed environment first (my household), no room for my parents (or any other family members). This sounds harsh, and I realize it when I write them down, but it is reality. I am part of an individualist society, where I worry about my next career move, my next holiday, my next house I will buy\u2026.It is not a free choice (now I hear you think, you always have a choice\u2026that is where you are wrong..you don\u2019t..if you are not with this mentality, you are against and when you are against, you are out and you will not have the ability to, for instance, influence policy makers). We are all doing it, we are all living in this society that \u201c forces\u201d  us into a materialistic approach towards life\u2026\u2026wanting more and more and abusing capitalism\u2026.it\u2019s a mentality\n\u201c How can we provide care in the broadest sense, if we are not willing to stribe towards equality\u201d? \u201cHow can we provide care in the broadest sense, when we are not able to change the individualist mentality we have in a large part of the western world\u201d? I mean, US is often seen as \u201c the leader of the free world\u201d , home of the brave, land of opportunities\u2026..yes, if you are born in the right circumstances (color, social class)\u2026.and it is this country that is trying it utmost to deprive the needed of care..\nThe challenges we face in care are utterly complex and not to be captured/solved in a project. They vary from indifference to ignorance\u2026\u2026from protectionism to fear. How do we change mentality in this world so we will not only improve the care system we have, but utterly we can have the entire world have a care system as good as ours\u2026and at the same time keep it affordable through a different way of caring?\nFirst thing we should do is not neglecting other parts of the world where people suffer from the same disasters the western world is facing, but only the essential impact to lives is exponentially bigger. Second thing we should do is asking ourselves how we can change individualistic mindsets and disconnect it of prosperity and wealth. \u201cWellbeing\u201d , not \u201cwealth\u201d should be the way that we should look at life\u2026easier said than done hey\u2026\ud83d\ude0a I just claimed I will never take my parents into my home, because it doesn\u2019t fit my dynamic life that brings me my wealth\u2026I am doing the same, how can I make a difference in changing this mentality then? Tough questions\u2026philosophical if you like and I don\u2019t have an answer, only the struggle\u2026perhaps awareness\u2026don\u2019t hide the misery in the \u201c third\u201d  world and focus on the western part\u2026\nI did promise to come back to the point that @faruqh  was trying to make\u2026\u2026correct me if I am wrong Faruqh but what I read from your comment is that one cannot oppose something to another group and expect them to \u201c live it\u201d\u2026..you cannot oppose democracy to the countries which don\u2019t have it (in our eyes)\u2026it is the arrogance of the western world that has caused total anarchy in the countries we\u201d tried to help\u201d\u2026..we should reason, educate, convince, teach\u2026.instead of oppose\u2026if that is what you meant, I totally agree. \nI hope I can \u201cfind the time somewhere\u201d (\ud83d\ude0a) to visit you guys at OpenVillage and discuss some more on this because I truly believe these are essential things to worry about when we think of sustainability and caring. If not, I am also convinced that when we still have people that care and think on these essential topics, in the end common sense will prevail and we (society) will get together in the sake of mankind.", "created_at": "2017-09-26 06:54:26.514585", "updated_at": "2017-09-30 13:24:21.443130", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1508, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 123.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769, 2915, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62051, "user_id": 5348, "topic_id": 10740, "post_number": 27, "raw": "i won't be able to make it at 5 unfortunately, I can probably do 5:30 if you can postpone for 30 min", "created_at": "2019-10-23 10:11:35.887920", "updated_at": "2019-10-23 10:11:35.887920", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62043], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81541, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 14202, "post_number": 22, "raw": "**First Question** <br /> asd <br /><br /> **Second Question** <br /> sadasddsaasd <br /><br /> **Third Question** <br />  <br /><br /> **Fourth Question** <br />  <br /><br /> **Fifth Question** <br />  <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-08-07 23:56:36.198845", "updated_at": "2020-08-07 23:56:36.198845", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56520, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 10329, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Thank you!

Both the Ashram Kitchen (link above) and the Jungle books use people from the camps to organise (cook, clean, serve, staff etc) their operations. Some parts of it a situated in specific areas of the camp and the people who live close to those amenities operate as security and safety overnight.\nIt's very much a case that the residents are very active on site. Whenever organisations start to build additional shelters, or do maintenance/repairs the locals get heavily involved. At the moment we aren't allowed to bring large-scale building material onto the site so resourceful communities and individuals are doing a lot of self building using scavenged wood and tarpualin/waterproof fabrics. There are lots of skilled people on the camps, some of them have been engineers, large scale construction workers so us volunteers are always happy to bring equipment, hand it out and then stand back and let the professionals handle the work.\nIt is probably true to say that there aren't any refugee-led projects on site, or if there are, i am not aware of them yet. It's certainly something i could find out more about by asking around.\nMy view is that most people living on the camp consider it to be a temporary pit stop before they get to the UK (even if it's 'temporary' for 9 months or more) and so aren't keen on setting up services long term on the camp when they could be in a lorry tomorrow night heading to Britain. Longer term residents who are more settled in the camp and are looked at as community leaders do a lot more than i am aware of, but in order to find out more about what they were doing to support each other it would be really benefitial to have a few translators who could have more detailled conversations with them.

FOOD team** \nProbably the most fun task on the list - communal cooking and serving historically provides a unique experience during our events. We need approximately 3-5 people for two first days of the conference. What's cooking? \n\nOn Day1, we will be using the kitchen in La Serre to prepare a dinner for the community. We need 5 volunteers who can run a kitchen. Please let us know who can do it, discuss the menu and send us the list of ingredients. We will make sure all is there waiting for you on the 19th of October. \n\nOn the Day 2, we need 3-5 volunteers who will help cooking with the [Up Cooking](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=487587141573451) team - in the afternoon, in La Serre (while other sessions will be in Au Quai). I can assure you, these guys are both a great company and wonderful chefs. You won't be cooking ordinary stuff - you will have a whole new experience.

This is a quick update on the line I am pursuing in contributing to the development work\u2026\n\nWhen it comes to tools for artistic collaboration/co-exploration/co-making I think they may have different requirements than those for e.g software development and or collaboration around \"getting things done\". When communication is happening in different channels: touch, smell, sound, movement etc.\n\nI have been researching art collectives and art movements both previous and contemporary to get a sense of how this could work in that context. My conclusion is that the foundation is _connection_ and _empathy_. \n\nConnection in the sense of crossing paths as well as the sense of piecing things together. Empathy in in the sense of emotional resonance in response to a shared triggering experience.\n\n* What traces does empathetic connection leave that can be picked up by electronic noses, eyes, ears, tongues, hands or skin?\n\n* And what open source technologies are out there that we can experiment with to create a working artefact to pick up such traces?\n\nThese two questions are keys to developing technology for facilitating conducive towards creative collaboration amongst large groups. To explore them we set out to build and experiment with technology for shamanic ritual.\n\n## Background\n\nWe define the Shamanic ritual as a codified experience in/through which a connected group of individuals is guided towards achieving emotional resonance or resolution in response to a triggering event. Let's call it empathetic connection. \n\nThe Shaman is the role of one who hosts such an event which both triggers and channels such empathetic connection in a group. He/She may use artefacts to conjure and hold the rituals that sets the scene for codified experiences as well as manages the dynamics between the participants. \n\nThe codified experience is an ephemeral virtual reality.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/51601969 \n\n\n It can be loose allowing/aiming for the unexpected or heavily scripted requiring participants to inhabit tightly predefined roles and interactions. The codified experience may aim to make visible what is \u201ctruly there\u201d  or  manipulative in the sense that there is a clear preconceived outcomes towards which participants are lead.\n\n* Are the individuals passive observers  of some stage upon which an otherworldly drama plays out?\n\n* Is the Shaman showing people how they/the world truly is or manipulating them into being something else?\n\n* Is the Shaman and or the other participants vessels or channels of something(s) outside themselves- and if so are these entities that truly exist or something fictional created by the shaman to suit their agenda?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TXZlmM-cXZM  \n\nI am currently playing around with this together with Pierre,a Brussels based artist.  We have a huge archive of coded experiences to draw from; wedding, the family dinner, press conferences, group fitness classes, alien abductions :))\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PfPdYYsEfAE\n\n\nAlso In artistic contexts we have looked at individuals and groups who have interesting ways of making empathetic connections... \n\n* Creating identities from DNA collected in public spaces - https://deweyhagborg.com/\n* Viennese Actionists especially  Valerie Export!- https://brightlightsfilm.com/finger-envy-a-glimpse-into-the-short-films-of-valie-export\n* Teamlab Japan https://www.teamlab.art/labs/ \n* Mika Oki's work in 3D spaces http://mikaoki.com/reverseosmosis\n\nWe will be running a happening in Brussels where we put our findings into practice sometime before or during January.

Taking placing during the academic year, the workshops are also being integrated into seminars dedicated to \"[Cultures of Open](https://www.hbksaar.de/vorlesungen/details/medientheorie-cultures-of-open)\" and \"[The Art of Decision](https://www.hbksaar.de/vorlesungen/details/medientheorie-die-kunst-der-entscheidung)\".\n\n**Workshop I Data Sovereignty**\n[date=2019-11-19 timezone=\"Europe/Brbussels\"] \u2192 [date=2019-11-19 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]\n* **Times:** 10.00 - 15:30\n* **Location:** East Side Fab - Halle 11, Eschbergerweg 40, 66121 Saarbr\u00fccken\n\n**Theme**: Basic introduction to the ways in which our daily activities generate data flows and the ways in which these may be harnessed to support autonomy and self-determination. We will look specifically at health- and workplace-related data, as this data is arguably the most personal, sensitive, and vulnerable to misuse. At the same time, it is precisely because of this that it offers a way to engage with data sovereignty concerns.\n\n**Context**: Developing a holistic approach to data literacy begins with awareness of the many overlapping data-generating contexts we pass through as we live and labor. As far as the bigger picture is concerned, this is it a key step toward co-designing that which affects how we act - collective intelligence design enables deep engagement with the socio-technological infrastructures structuring and sustaining our agency. Workshop in cooperation with [Open Saar e.V.](https://opensaar.de/)\n\n**Workshop II Data Governance and Decentralized Technologies**\n[date=2019-11-28 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"] \u2192 [date=2019-11-28 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]\n* **Times:** 14:00 - 18:00\n* **Location:** K8, Ufergasse 2, 66111 Saarbr\u00fccken\n\n**Theme**: New ideas related to data governance have come from communities engaging with blockchain technologies. We will take a look at some of these ideas and bring them together with approaches from the [cooperative](https://www.saluscoop.org/) universe. Workshop II offers in-depth follow-up to Workshop I.\n\n**Context**: Decentralized technologies have become key areas of collective intelligence design [experimentation](http://daostack.io). While some of these efforts have been criticized for reproducing the not-so-open geek cultures of tech research (\"blokechain\"), these technologies are too important to leave them to the usual techno-libertarian suspects. So we need to find ways to bring more people into a key systems design process.\n\n**Workshop III Community Architectures**\n[date=2019-11-29 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"] \u2192 [date=2019-11-29 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]\n* **Times:** 10:00 - 16:00\n* **Location:** xm:lab, Keplerstr. 3-5, 66117 Saarbr\u00fccken / Blida, Metz\n\n**Theme**: How do we bring sustainable architecture / upcycling / renewable energy communities into the design process of a workspace for a new commons-oriented cooperative? We will look at two existing spaces and co-develop a vision for a new space here in Saarbr\u00fccken. Following a (remote) walk-through of COACTlab in Barcelona we will visit [Bliiida](https://www.bliiida.fr/) in Metz, France, just across the border.\n\n**Context**: Members of the Academy of Fine Arts Saar have initiated the foundation of a cooperative (s:coop) to actively contribute to a new economy. Locally, this has involved exchanges with various actors from freelancing, innovation, and start-up communities. Now the time has come to develop and design a physical space that can operate as a community architecture. And one way to get started is to look what others have already done.\n\n## Who will participate?\n\n* Members of Open Saar e.V.\n* Soenke Zehle @soenke\n* Julia Hartnik, Co-CEO, K8\n* Hannes K\u00e4fer, Director, Digital Production Center, HBKsaar\n* William Lloyd-George @William_COACT\n* Liliana Carillo @lylycarrillo, Digityser, Brussels \n* Andrea Barbiero, [Salus Coop](https://www.saluscoop.org/), Barcelona\n* [Jens Dittrich](https://bigdata.uni-saarland.de/people/dittrich.php), Big Data Analytics Group @ Saarland University\n* Uto Scheidt, DIDP, Saarland University\n\n**To be confirmed**\n\n* Members of Technoport, Luxembourg \n* Members of CNA, Luxembourg\n* Members of s:coop, Saarbr\u00fccken\n* You!\n\n<hr>\n\n# Frequently asked questions\n\n### How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?\n\n**Complete the registration form: https://register.edgeryders.eu/**\n\n### How is this event being organised?\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event.

I never thought much about it, and the subject doesn\u2019t seem to pop up even in the more liberal media, possibly because all of them are somehow complicit in the crime.  \n\nJoana explores the way Internet materializes and how the general idea of a \u201ccloud\u201d that magically connects people all over the world is successfully obscuring the actual size of the infrastructure that runs underground and oceans, occupies facilities the size of farms and involves kilometers of cables. \n\nWe are aware of certain risks and dangers that communication infrastructure poses to the Earth - in form of \u201crare\u201d elements (which are not that rare, as it turns out: https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/mining/whats-so-rare-about-rare-earth-elements/) exploitation, horrible conditions of labor where that work is done, transportation of the items, maybe a little bit less about the toxic waste that extracting these rare materials and preparing them for actual use also involves. These are mostly connected to the physical devices we interact with - harder to pretend they don't exist. And these are already huge, damning figures. But there\u2019s so much more to it. \n\nSome physical aspects of the Internet have consequences that seem to be poorly researched so far - Joana showed for example pictures of dead whales on the western shores of Europe who died a mysterious death some years ago - and which could be attributed to the impact that the trans-Atlantic cables have on the ecosystem. \n\nThere also doesn't seem to be enough talk about political, post-colonial consequences of the location of facilities that \"run\" the show. Maps showing the concentration of servers and cables connecting the rest of the world together display a very obvious trend, where powerful cities and centers in the North-Western parts of the world pretty much own the whole thing. \n\nAnother mind-boggling part of her work is a real-life online piece that shows you how much CO2 did the Google emit since you entered her site. You can check it here  http://www.janavirgin.com/CO2/.\n\nI guess for me this was the strongest piece of her practice. Well, just read this:\n\n_40% of the Internet\u2019s total carbon footprint may be attributed to the design of a website. According to recent studies, the Internet is responsible for the 2% of CO2 of global emissions, more than that of the aviation industry [1]. On average, the production of 1 kWh emits 544 gr. of CO2 [2]. It takes 13 kWh to transmit 1GB of information [3], the equivalent of 7,07 kg. of CO2. Following a study executed by CISCO, the estimated number of the annual global Internet data traffic in 2015 will go as far as 966 Exabytes (1.037.234.601.984GB) [4] and is expected to reach 1579,2 Exabytes by the end of 2018 [5]._\n\n_Google.com is the most visited site on the Internet [6] and weighs nearly 2MB. The site processes an approximate average of 47000 requests every second [7], which represents an estimated amount of 500 kg of CO2 emissions per second._\n\nFor me, these are petrifying news. But when I asked what were her personal strategies to reduce her own impact, she said she didn\u2019t have any. It made me think how pirate networks and files transferred from people more or less in person might be in fact one of the ways to improve the situation. It would also change a little bit the impersonal character of the connections we make with each other thanks to The Internet - forcing us to balance file-trade with some personal interaction like they do with the USB-stick sharing in Cuba.", "created_at": "2018-11-14 11:11:58.025293", "updated_at": "2018-11-15 09:07:12.977152", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 697, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 433.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3, 4994], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63083, "user_id": 5185, "topic_id": 11330, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Nie b\u0119d\u0119 wcale oryginalny w swoich stwierdzeniach.

Realise how much this is needed after the futuremakers conversations in Cairo. I went to one of the fuck up nights some time ago and very much appreciated it for two reasons. The first is the diversity- people from very different walks of life sharing hard learned lessons about what went wrong, how as well as how they were moving on or trying to fix them. Things like dealing with the practical and psychological consequences of bankruptcy, how people go about rebuilding shattered reputations and self confidence. Across the board- activists, entrepreneurs, consultants, political campaigners etc. I felt I learned a lot about very different lines of work and sectors, and societies, in a short time. This is well aligned with what I believe is something we do very well in Edgeryders- building spaces where peeople from very different contexts can engage in respectful, mutually generative exchange that helps us all level up.\u00a0\n\nThe second thing I appreciated is the high quality of content and organisation, including preparation and communication efforts. FUCKup. In LOTE4 we crossed a threshold. The case study adventures, the curators, and <a href=\"/t/can-networked-communities-steward-public-assets-at-scale/4345\">the report on Stewardship</a>. A similar process around failure could generate something really really interesting.\u00a0\n\nEdgeryders has a base in Brussels where we can host a few guests, and I doubt it would be difficult to source venues etc. Plus the city is easy and cheap to get to from a lot of places e.g. by Bla bla cars.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-06 06:51:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.374997", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 280, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2537, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48740, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 9204, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@alex_levene @Malka @Raffaele and I have just had a meeting on the panel design for the Econ Sci Fi Zone of Experimentation (ZoX) at the UNDP's [Istanbul Innovation Days](https://www.innovationdays.istanbul/) on #nextgengov. \n\nOur session is one of six ZoX's introduced to attendees as follows:\n\n> Host: Edgeryders Research Network\n\n> Featuring a panel discussion between Malka Older, Writer; Raffaele Miniachi, Economist; and Alberto Cottica, Research Director, Edgeryders and immersive experiments with Anique Yael Vered, Head of Development: Edgeryders Research Network & Alex Levene, Associate Producer: Edge Arts & Culture, Edgeryders.\n\n> Frame: Does \u2018science fiction\u2019 writing point to alternative ways of organizing resources and building new, just economic systems? What can we learn from speculative fiction about potential future economics? The session provides a platform and fertile environment for the exploration of the economic ideas in science fiction. We explore the pairing between science fiction speculation and economic theory. What is already happening? What can be seen in the data? How does engaging this lens open up innovative ways of implementing new economic and development strategies?\n\nThe immersive experiments have been developed separately and can be found [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/did-you-say-speculations-participatory-programming-for-econ-sci-fi-in-istanbul/9037/9?u=anique.yael).\n\nAs per [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coupling-economic-issues-with-sf-literature-building-blocks-for-econ-sf-seminar-in-istanbul/9140/4) by @alberto, the panel is featuring @malka and @Raffaele in discussion with @alberto to set the scene of Econ Sci Fi and offer attendees a tangible entry into how it can be useful for building governance of the future. And in @malka's words: how \"science fiction can be a tool to question the present.\"\n\nIn our call - which unfortunately was missing the key person convening the panel @alberto - we came up with a panel formation everyone is comfortable with and thinks will work well.

The state-sponsored global corporate-economy has generated intense anxiety that has fueled ultranationalist sentiment and a growing support of authoritarian regimes to \u201ctake back control.\u201d \n\nSimultaneously, we are faced with interrelated planetary threats, from offshore tax-havens to species-threatening climate change, that are addressed neither by corporations nor by national governments in an effective way: they contribute to their cause, rather than their solution. \n\nTransunions gathers various organizations invested in theorizing, mapping and practicing new models of emancipatory transnationalism in the field of politics, economy, ecology, education and culture, striving to establish new models of planetary egalitarianism.\n\nDuring Transunions transnational organizations, parties, civil platforms, think tanks and activist groups, gather to discuss:\n\u2013 the meaning of the nation-state;\n\u2013 the challenges and gains of transnational organizations today;\n\u2013 the future of a new transnational union.\n\nGathered together around a single table, they pre-enact a new transnational order of the future into the present.\n\nTransunions will take place in the Palace of Science and Culture on 22nd June - a monumental architecture surrounded by sculptures of internationalist revolutionaries, \u201cgifted\u201d from Stalin to the Polish people. From the Cold War onwards, Poland - in its alliance with the Soviet Union - invested substantially in post-colonial nations in North-Africa and the Middle East. In a time of growing ultranationalism, TRANSUNIONS redefines this internationalist heritage in light of a new transnational horizon.\n\n\nStudio Jonas Staal in collaboration with Biennale Warszawa\nAnna Galas-Kosil (curator), Bartosz Fr\u0105ckowiak (curator)\n\nWith contributions by Dounia Kchiere (former United Nations); Fernando Burges (Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, UNPO); Andrzej Nowak (philosopher, Poznan University); Abderrahim Kassou (Alternatives Forum of Morocco, FMAS); Esra K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck (Maxim Gorki Theatre/ Young Islam Conference); Mike van Graan, (African Cultural Policy Network, ACPN); John Jordan (The Laboratory of Insurrectionary Imagination, Zone a Defendre ZAD, Notre Dame des Landes); Amgad Elmahdi (International Water Management Institute, IWMI); Diana Arce and Angelo Camufingo (Black Lives Matter Berlin); Kurdish Women\u2019s Movement; Lorenzo Marsili (DiEM25/European Alternatives/ School of Transnational Activism), Siana Bangura (Black Lives Matter UK); Fiona Dove (Transnational Institute, TNI); Zdenka Badovinac (L\u2019Internationale).\n\nCo-chaired by Joanna Warsza and Chris Keulemans.", "created_at": "2019-05-14 10:25:42.419434", "updated_at": "2019-05-14 13:37:23.172312", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 38.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44269, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8534, "post_number": 4, "raw": "It's a fine idea.

Why is bureaucracy so pervasive, resilient and expansionary organizing principle of human activities? Its rise in the modern age was attributed to efficiency gains, and there certainly were plenty of those. But post-modern societies tend to introduce bureaucracy even where they appear to _reduce_ efficiency.\n\nObservation of this phenomenon is itself interesting, but recently Graeber published a brilliant article in which he takes a look at its possible causes. He has (ethnographic) data concerning \"the bullshitization of academic jobs\". The theory is still relatively rough, but seductive. The main engine seems to be that higher-ups desire entourages to make them look more magnificent, just like feudal lords did. Once the entourages are established, the prevailing \"managerialist\" ideology dictates that at least some (BS) work is made up for them. Some of this work ends up creating more BS work for other people: for example, the Italian ministry of education has introduced a practice of schools self-evaluating, starting in the early 2010s. This has spawned an entire agency devoted to that, called [ANVUR](http://www.anvur.org/). ANVUR collects, aggregates and reflects the self-evaluation reports issued by schools (there are about 20K schools in Italy, if memory serves); so, the only way it can function is by imposing the admin (hence BS, in Graeber's language) duty of producing these reports on the people whose (non-BS) job is to teach kids. \n\nA positive feedback kicks in, because now the new (BS) activity will also, naturally, require someone to be in charge of it. This person, or people, will then want their \"tiny empires\" of PAs and middle managers to rule over. This will require them to invent at least some meta-BS jobs for them to do. If this sounds exaggerated, consider that ANVUR has 21 employees at the time of writing, but the employees do not actually evaluate schools (or better, do not meta-evaluate their self-evaluation reports). Such core activity is farmed out to roughly 50 \"evaluation experts\" with small contracts of 2K to 20K EUR (list [here](http://www.anvur.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=435&Itemid=451&lang=it)). There are even ANVUR employees in charge of monitoring ANVUR's own performance, which should depend on how well ANVUR monitors the performance of schools. So:\n\n1. Teachers teach kids. This is, without a doubt, making the world a better place.\n\n2. Then they self-evaluate. This can help them do a better job, but to a first approximation it takes time away from teaching kids. The jury is out whether this time is still making the world a better place. \n\n3. School principals collate and integrate the data from teachers into school-level self evaluation reports. Hmm.\n\n4. ANVUR evaluation experts collate and meta-assess the self-evaluation reports coming from schools.\n\n5. Most ANVUR employees and management coordinate the admin around the activity of ANVUR evaluation experts.\n\n6. ANVUR employees in charge of evaluating the performance of ANVUR itself generate data and reports on the activity of their colleagues, who oversee the evaluation experts, who oversee the schools, who manage the teachers who actually teach the kids. They are four levels removed from actual non-BS work! It highly doubtful that these people, brilliant though they may be, are contributing anything at all to human well-being. \n\nSo, why does this happen? And why in universities? In the words of one of Graeber's informants:\n\n> It is not capitalism per se that produces the bullshit. It is managerialist ideologies put into practice in complex organisations. As managerialism embeds itself, you get entire cadres of academic staff whose job it is just to keep the managerialist plates spinning \u2014 strategies, performance targets, audits, reviews, appraisals, renewed strategies, etc, etc. \u2014 which happen in an almost wholly and entirely disconnected fashion from the real life blood of universities \u2014 teaching and education.\n\nThe full article is well worth a read, especially if you \u2013 like us \u2013 are struggling with designing or scaling organizations (as in the discussion I am running with @anique.yael [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dynamic-process-design-and-project-planning-application/8132/2) ). \n\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/Are-You-in-a-BS-Job-In/243318", "created_at": "2018-05-08 12:48:31.373188", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 23:57:17.657974", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 754, "wiki": false, "reads": 34, "score": 2451.8, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4107, 3310, 3811, 4265, 4288, 3904, 3406], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61431, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 11152, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So last week we had a virtual cafe for Serbia, in 1 hour we had time to define the workshop in Belgrade and decide on our action plan. @TamaraVuk already wrote about part and is doing a good job on that side with Milan and Tihana, they are all very engaged.\n\nSince we didn't have time for discussing Becej workshop, I created a Becej workgroup on facebook. Organised a new conference call via messenger and we had it yesterday.\n\nViktor, a guy I met at the Becej meetup last month, gave a proposal of a community project he wants to see happen. It's a great idea so we defined it betetr and discussed how to mobilise the community around it.\nHis idea was to create a sort of a micro factory in the town, where the young could come and learn how to use various machines, craft things for the town and replace older or broken ones. There is a vandalism problem in Becej so he hoped this would have them feel more involved and reduce vandalism...help them realise it's their town really.\n\nWe expanded the idea a bit, made it a creative center of sorts, with idea to include schools, get support from municipalities etc. In any case, it deserves a separate post. :slight_smile:\n\n**Results from the last night's meeting:**\n-We have 2 professors from gymnasium on board already\n-We decided to create a poll within the 3 high schools in the town, propose them the project and ask them basically what do they need. We will adapt the project to that and move forward with it.\n-We have already received a proposal to do few workshops prior to the one in November directly in school to kids, tell them about Wellbeing in Serbia and the project\n-We are now working to gather all interested stakeholders in the town for the November workshop\n\nSo, plan of our workshops in Becej is:\n1. Who are Edgeryders, what is Wellbeing in Serbia, why do the stories matter (this part should be stressed already at earlier workshops directly in schools)\n2. Theme: creativity and entrepreneurship, how to reach the point of doing things we are passionate about and live a meaningful life\n3. Present the 'creative center' and have an open discussion about it\n\nAbout those earlier workshops directly in schools, I could do them as a local boy and would love to but in case it costs too much/takes too much time, me and @TamaraVuk will discuss it and find a solution for her to do them if possible. \nOne option is also to have our Becej workshop done Friday, before the Belgrade one.

We had agreed on using [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/), but in practice we had: \n\n1. Styled components, with styles defined in the component files where they were used (**correct**)\n2. Bootstrap CSS, applied globally (**fine**)\n3. A few custom css styles that were applied globally (**not ok**)\n4. A few styled components that were defined in a \"styles\" js file and imported in the components where they were actually used (**not ok**). \n\nI've refactored so that we only have concepts 1 and 2 in our codebase. Feel free to argue if you don't agree ;) It's ok to define styled components outside of the component where they are used if they are clearly reusable, but if so they should be thought of as their own presentational components and put in the ui/src/components/ directory individually (styled components are just normal React components after all).\n\nSince the refactor is taking a while I've pushed the branch I'm working on in case anyone is curious and wants to take a look: [ui-apollo-refactor](https://github.com/theborderland/realities/tree/ui-apollo-refactor)\n\n:heart::heart::heart:", "created_at": "2018-09-30 14:53:03.116309", "updated_at": "2018-09-30 14:53:03.116309", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 263, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 54.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60155, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 10870, "post_number": 6, "raw": "The latest info: [the webinar](https://www.ngi.eu/event/info-session-ict-54-2020-23oct/?utm_content=buffer215a8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) will be held on 23rd of October, \"it will cover the three sub-topics of the call and will give participants the possibility of presenting their project ideas and pose their questions.\"", "created_at": "2019-09-30 13:16:44.453514", "updated_at": "2019-09-30 13:16:44.453514", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 57, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59953], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77192, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13249, "post_number": 30, "raw": "which project is the climate positive one again? the remote work thing or something else?", "created_at": "2020-05-22 04:20:59.861850", "updated_at": "2020-05-22 04:20:59.861850", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77187], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35797, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 6973, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks for the thoughts.

Anybody an idea on how to retrieve that?\n\nFourth (only for those who are interested in who is talking here):\n\nMy name is Burkhard, i dropped out of university somewhere in the early 90s. One of the reasons for dropping out was that I felt I could do something more relevant than studying (another reason was of course that I was not able to convince myself to learn things I was not interested in). And I got a job offer from EYFA, in Sittard, the Netherlands (it was \"only\" a volunteers position, but that did not matter to me). EYFA stood for European Youth Forest Action then, today it is European Youth for Action. And a dream for me came true: to work and live in a foreign country, with people from all over Europe. From EYFA my journey brought me to former Yugoslavia, to work for peace and humanitarian organisations (Suncokret, <a href=\"http://mediafilter.org/ztn/\">ZamirTransNational</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mir.org/vpp/\">Volunteers Project Pakrac</a>). After a couple years, living in a region heavily affected by war, I needed a rest and found that back in Germany, in an intentional community. I was never good with (my own) finances, which was one of the conditions to live in that community, so eventually I dropped out there (again) and found myself in the centre of town. While I was still living in the community friends of mine founded an association called Belziger Forum to fight right extremism and violence in the town. The main focus of this association is running a cafe serving as a meeting place for refugees and locals. We do seminars, football tournaments, parties and other stuff (see http://www.derwinkel.de/index.php/fotokiste), most of them inter-cultural. In the meantime I managed to create a job for myself at Belziger Forum (with a little help from the unemployment office and the board of Belziger Forum), my work contract will finish end October this year.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-17 17:48:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.706353", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77558, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13575, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-05-27 18:38:17.572754", "updated_at": "2020-05-27 18:38:27.155561", "deleted_at": "2020-05-27 18:38:34.287473", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 89112, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 15116, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<Webkit>\n\n<Config>\n\n```\n\nchild:\n  title: Babel\n  slug: babel\n  parent: 14767\n  summary: Some text for social media cards\n  keywords: open source, partipatory\n  image: https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cd80fc722f3b5b26feddb8054600b435a61a0187.jpg\n\n```\n\n</Config>\n\n<Header style=\"background: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522441815192-d9f04eb0615c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=882&q=80') no-repeat; background-size: cover; background-attachment: fixed; background-position: 0 -20px\">\n\n<Text>\n\n## Babel {style=\"color: white\"}\n\nParagraph {style=\"color: white; font-weight:100\"}\n\n</Text>\n\n</Header>\n\n<Content id=\"section 1\" >\n\n## Particip.io tools in action (move to Plato page)\n\n<Text>\n\nMany participatory festivals use software developed by our network, including <strong><u><a href='http://theborderland.se/'  style=\"color:rgb(47,133,242)\">The Borderland</a></u></strong> in Denmark, <strong><u><a href='http://www.burners.at/wetzlas/doku.php?id=start'  style=\"color:rgb(47,133,242)\">Schloss Sch\u00f6nburn</a></u></strong> in Austria, <strong><u><a href='https://talk.theborderland.se/bivrost'  style=\"color:rgb(47,133,242)\">Bivrost</a></u></strong> in Norway, <strong><u><a href='https://kiezburn.org/'  style=\"color:rgb(47,133,242)\">Kiez Burn</a></u></strong> in Germany, <strong><u><a href='https://www.facebook.com/urbanburnsthlm/'  style=\"color:rgb(47,133,242)\">Urban Burn</a></u></strong> in Sweden, and <strong><u><a href='https://www.facebook.com/Burnerot/'  style=\"color:rgb(47,133,242)\">Burnerot</a></u></strong> in Israel.\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n<Content id=\"section 2\" >\n\n<Text>\n\n## This is a second section\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

I\u2019m from the Netherlands and I was born in Doetinchem, a small town close to the border with Germany. I moved to Amsterdam for my studies, I lived there until one and a half years ago, but never really fell in love with it. Then I moved to Brussels - attracted by some weird things I knew about it. The two languages, the different municipalities, the presence of the EU, etc. It was a strange choice, I didn\u2019t know Brussels at all, but I think it was a good choice as Brussels continues to inspire me. My areas of expertise and interest are urban/emotional/feminist geography, the just city and feminism and emancipation in general.\n\n# My professional life before Corona\n\nIn January I quit my job, so I was already without a job before Corona. I used to work for the city of Amsterdam, as a policy advisor for a just city, women\u2019s emancipation, and fairness issues in the city. I used to go to Amsterdam every few weeks, but mostly I worked remote, from cafes. I would see a lot of people, I would dress up nicely, had a social feeling. Seeing different environments and people all the time made me happy and I loved the feeling of freedom.\n\nI want to work as a freelancer now, because I like the freedom and being able to work for different projects, focusing more on the content of the work instead of also having to spend energy on team meetings, etc. In January I wanted to give myself a few months off, and see where my passions took me. I got two assignments as a freelancer, one of which was to design an urban experience for a festival about the political body. Due to the crisis, both assignments were delayed. They wouldn\u2019t have paid rent anyway. I live off my savings now. In the future, for more paid work I would rather work on writing EU applications as a more lucrative job.\n\n!['my%20tree'|517x690](upload://1ScxhxVQqgz4aZFJ5nvsb3zJNQO.jpeg) \n*Postcard: Every morning I take a picture of the tree in the middle of the square I see from my window.* \n\n# Equity and belonging in the city\n\nI created [Urbanistas Brussels](https://www.facebook.com/groups/408097989769670/), a network for women city makers in Brussels: geographers, architects, planners, and just women interested in the city, wanting to connect and share and to make the city a better place.\n\nAnother personal project is Urban Boudoir, with which I focus on emotions and personal experiences in the city. Something that inspired me to continue working on this topic was an amazing workshop I participated in last October, a series of **embodied night walks.** We would walk with 10-15 women. We would choose where we\u2019d go in the city. Every time someone else would choose and it stood out to me that some people chose neighborhoods where a lot of migrants were living, as these were seen as \u2018unsafe\u2019 neighborhoods. There was sometimes this idea that we needed to \u2018reclaim the city\u2019. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that as I haven\u2019t lived in Brussels for a long time, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for me to \u2018claim\u2019 or to \u2018reclaim\u2019 the city. And we visited areas that me and some of the other women had never been to before, so how can we say that we want to \u2018claim\u2019 or even \u2018reclaim\u2019 these areas? Actually, I don\u2019t believe in ownership over the city in general. I believe more in growing a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019.\n\nSometimes we stigmatise one whole area and the people living there when there are in fact just 1 or 2 more unsafe streets. In the process, we all became more aware of our position, how even personal experiences can make you project your fear onto the public space. It was humbling. We read a paragraph from Sara Ahmed\u2019s book [The Cultural Politics of Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cultural_Politics_of_Emotion). She wrote about how the bodies that are least in danger fear the most. Fear is sometimes a \u2018reasonable response\u2019 to vulnerability, but anxiety doesn\u2019t always correspond to actual danger. She writes that when we feel exposed to possible danger or discomfort our bodies shrink and the world starts pressing against it. It sounds a bit spiritual but it\u2019s true. When we fear we literally start taking up less space and we won\u2019t slow down or look around anymore. In this way we don\u2019t establish a relationship with the space and it will then never evolve into a place for us. From then on I ask myself: *What am I feeling exactly? Where does my fear come from? Where do I feel it in my body? Where am I projecting it?*\n\n**The just city is a city that centers around equity, diversity and democracy. Equity is the most important aspect for me - it is different from equality in that it means that people win the same and lose the same when public policies are rolled out or when there are interventions.** During the lockdown you see this gap being felt - people are chased by the police and lose their life, yet others like me gain so much freedom from the lockdown. The same situation impacts people very differently. Another way in which this plays out is that when neighborhoods are upgraded, made more green or more walkable for example, it\u2019s a good thing, but what happens then is that more people want to be there, nice coffee places and businesses appear, rents go up, and people who used to live there get pushed out. What we also see is that generally white women feel safer in predominantly white areas. In this way, the freedom, and therefore the emancipation of one group goes against that of the other. Darnell L. Moore of [The Feminist Wire](https://thefeministwire.com/) writes about this in [The Just City Essays](https://www.thenatureofcities.com/the-just-city-essays/). He writes that whiteness has become a signifier for safety, for wealth, for business opportunities, for good. Increased whiteness in a neighborhood brings increased resources and more police presence. This police presence does not guarantee safety in the same way for black people as it does for white people, as we can also see in Brussels. For making the city more just we therefore need a more intersectional approach; different groups and different interests need to be kept in mind at the same time by the same people.\n\n# Thinking about life after Corona and what could be different in Brussels\n\nWhat really intrigues me about the corona measures are the changes that we will feel on the personal level and how these will influence the dynamics in public space. I think our sense of personal space is going to change, for example. Right now, if I walk the streets and my thoughts wander, I forget to keep 1.5 meters of distance between me and another being, because the prescribed 1.5 meters is not ingrained in my body yet. It might be that in a while it will be, and I start feeling iffy if a person moves within that 1.5 meter radius. This development has consequences for public space as well. **A bigger personal space requires wider sidewalks, a different design for benches and wider door frames, for example. There\u2019s also this idea of creating one way streets and sidewalks. This will influence the interaction people have with each other in the streets. It means that you won\u2019t cross paths with as many people anymore. I foresee lost shared smiles and lost flirts!** Something else I see is that more people start intentionally using public space. I hope this is a sustainable change. I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with women about how they engage with public space, and what really stood out to me is that women oftentimes only use public space to get from A to B, especially at night. There\u2019s so much to enjoy outside in the city and I hope that in the future we will all feel more comfortable lingering outside, without a reason besides enjoying ourselves.\n\n# On personal rhythm during the lockdown\n\nEvery few months or years I\u2019m asking myself: why am I doing what I\u2019m doing? Am I in the right place? Does the motivation come from the right place? These questions came to me again during this period, and luckily this time I had more time to *feel* what the answers were, rather than motivating everything with rationale. **I\u2019ve noticed that I normally feel so much pressure to show myself, to establish myself, and that I experience so much FOMO** - that faded away for the most part during the Corona crisis. When I hear about people starting new projects, like in the [edgeryders] community, I do think about whether I should too, and I feel this pressure... before I could not feel the difference between internal and external motivation. So maybe this is a beginning to get more in touch with myself.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading a lot of books - one in particular about attachment styles, and fear of commitment and abandonment. It\u2019s a Dutch book, but a translation is in the making. It\u2019s called [Liefdesbang](https://www.hannahcuppen.nl/en/books/), or *Love Phobia*, and it\u2019s by Hannah Cuppen. She writes that we sometimes feel that we need to earn the right to exist. We want other people and the outside world to reassure us that we matter, that we\u2019re worthy. I became aware of that tendency in me now. It\u2019s a sign of growth, maybe I was doing those projects before to be seen, rather than have them come from inside. It\u2019s a relief to realise it, but also scary, because now I don\u2019t know what to do. The question I now have: *If I feel worthy as a person regardless, what would I still do?*\n\nAnother book I am reading is [Intimiteit](https://www.standaardboekhandel.be/p/intimiteit-9789403139104?gclid=CjwKCAjw4871BRAjEiwAbxXi20XD_PPFdi_vHXvkbRBOHVHOopf90r70t9n7SMJ2WHDXtPZID8PzzhoCAncQAvD_BwE), or *Intimacy*, by Belgian psychiatrist Paul Verhaeghe. Coincidentally, or actually I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence, he also writes about the role of other people in our lives, but he mostly refers to the Other as an abstract being, an always present mechanism that influences how we feel about ourselves. The intimacy that he writes about has to do with feeling intimacy within ourselves. A really important book in these isolated times.\n\n**I really miss purpose.** At the beginning I didn\u2019t really feel that way, but now I miss having a reason to get up. It sounds worse than it is, because I am not depressed, but I don\u2019t even feel like going outside to take a walk at this point, while I normally love walking in the city. I go running sometimes, but I don\u2019t leave the house much.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of structure i.e. I don\u2019t get up at the same time every day. But there are rituals that I really like: Every morning I take a picture of the tree in the middle of the square I see from my window. At 8 in the evening we clap for care workers, and musicians and actors around play songs every night. These are the start and ending of the day, and this gives me structure.\n\nI started to make my own coffee, including cappuccino. I also buy flowers to give my house a little more color, and things like that. That helps to feel more comfortable in my home and it really works. I feel really happy with my place right now.\n\n**I feel more mindful: even if I don\u2019t have big events daily, the days are full of little experiences and I am more aware of all my senses.** I think it\u2019s a sort of micro awareness, and I want to keep having it. I now feel that I don\u2019t have to go very far or travel far places to have rich experiences.\n\n# Curious from Edgeryders:\n\nI would like to know more about European grant writing possibilities, so if anyone knows of projects coming up or needs help they can let me know. Also, I am always interested in sharing thoughts on the city and exploring ideas together. People can of course always contact me if they have questions about equity and emancipation in the city.", "created_at": "2020-05-07 15:14:43.960014", "updated_at": "2020-07-03 15:38:03.433569", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2111, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 569.8, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4096, 4, 5, 4934, 428, 3293, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39945, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7772, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"Yosser, post:1, topic:7772\"]As for @matthias,we will be super excited to have you with us and meet you finally \u2026 so if you are coming, please confirm it to us, and tell us which workshop you can manage :slight_smile:[/quote]\n\nThank you @yosser for the nice invitation (\u2026 and I'm sorry for the delay to answer, I'm quite underwater with stuff to do atm).

Just thought I'd make that connection.\n\nWith regard to some of the text of your post I'd posit that (in part) this perception of the \"isolated pale white dude\" was because in the early days this very much was the \"internet demography\". Of course things change, but not necessarily in concert with narratives, which like to lag. \nThat said it is obvious that challenging the narrative is a good thing (as so fricken often). \n\nIn other news to @matthias the mp3 school is still in the works and slowly evolving. I met up with @gentlewest here a looong time ago and we've been at it since then. You can totally book that as an ER win. Also he recently participated and won some money in a challenge on our collab site, which can begin to show you emerging possibilities.\nCurrently he is working mostly reactively as the situation in Bamenda is a rapidly deteriorating [shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1yoEV_sV2g) [sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By24ardaOAI). He is mostly busy with the refugees' basic needs at this point. \nStill, we have approximately 40 mp3 players (etc.) and 100 sd-cards with some basic audio lectures on site.\nCurrent goal on his end is to make an adapted local dialect recording of relevant excerpts of this book: https://www.amazon.com/Where-Women-Have-No-Doctor/dp/0942364252 that we lifted of the net. \nOn my end I am working on sourcing and sometimes ruggedizing/feminizing a bunch of mp3 players, small solar, powerbank kits, recorders, documentation means, spare parts and tools.\nOf course the hope is to make this as much as possible of them, by them, for them with emphasis on content adaptation, and hardware life extension. \n\nWe are aiming to set up some sort of organization after the pilot runs of this are done. The phase 1 value prop being in short: Resource efficient basic education (and stress relief) for the marginalized, illiterate, and busy in environments where schools do not work or do not exist. \nPhase 2: Allow optimization for specific outcomes including, content spread, local content adaptation / creation, impact vs cost, self sustainability, and 2-way learning. \n\nBut to be realistic, we'll need help on the organization front and currently the IDP situation is so bad I am thinking about ordering rolls of tyvek from China to have them locally made into repurposable blankets with mosquito netting and a pocket for the mp3 player glued on.

I am operating under the assumption that most partners will only have a vague idea of what we actually do, so I have decided to focus on a high level description of what we do. \n\nThere are two parts: \n\n1. **What we do (and how you can use it)**. This describes the final product that we craft (SSNA), and how it is supposed to enter in the work of other partners in the consortium. The goal of this part is to prompt partners to work more closely with us. I draw people's attention to the fact that our work is typically upstream in the flow chart, providing input to other people's research. For example, POPREBEL:\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/49a97667c166d390f8b5ffe05937c3312c7d816f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\">\n\n2. **How we do it**. This part is an overview of what actions we will be carrying out, and how they fit into the big picture. I plan to walk partners through the Edgeryders main sequence: convene the conversation, manage the community, run the analysis, while providing technical and ethical support.\n\nWhat I need from you is one or two slides each for this second part. Deadline: Tuesday 8th.\n \n* @nadia on engagement and convening\n* @noemi and @johncoate on community management. The main stumbling blocks differ: for POPREBEL, it is a potentially controversial conversation, that could turn difficult and even violent. For NGI FORWARD, the challenge is to make the debate attractive and relevant for non-tech lobbyists. This means highlighting the links between technical and governance choices and the emergent patterns of use of the Internet the result for these choices. \n* @matthias on technical support.\n* @amelia, if you could review part 1. \n\nI have put the POPREBEL presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRa3_Tjth0RIvM6bKJhQqxn9RDt1izIP).

There's always the tension between presenting a single problem very robustly and trying to see what's going on/what connections are made/what is common across different problems presented across the site.\n\nIf I'm doing my job right we are looking more at community thinking rather than me thinking. It's helpful to have one ethnographer (it's going to be interesting to see what happens when we try and expand to do more collective ethnography) because I have a standardised vocabulary across codes. (e.g. 'migration' rather than all the other synonyms one could use instead). Part of cleaning up the data will be streamlining codes that mean the same thing, while being careful not to over-correct (subtle differences are crucial and informative, like the difference between 'resilence' and 'sustainability'). Also important to note that mental health is higher up in a hierarchy that includes codes like 'depression' and 'suicide' nested underneath it. Same with 'therapy,' which has 'group therapy' and 'online therapy' nested underneath it, for example.

Cilj ove radionice je bio da se lokalne organizacije (kao sto ste vi) koje su u kreativnom sektoru i koje rade sa mladima upoznaju sa projektom, da se povezemo svi u jednu cijelinu i otvoreno razgovaramo o centru za inovacije.

Ja cu od pocetka biti transparentan i trudim se napraviti organizaciju u cijoj ce strukturi biti Becejci i EU partneri...a ne JA. Ne mogu to da izlozim doduse ako ljudi ne daju priliku.

Rekli smo vise puta, Edgeryders ce biti partneri lokalnim zajednicama koje su aktivne i preduzetne. Imam osjecaj da ljudi ocekuju da ja ovaj projekat iznesem na ledjima ili da to neko drugi uradi(i znam da je to najlakse za ljude). Ja bi tako djelovao da ja to radim u okviru moje firme ali s'obzirom na prirodu projekta to nema smisla. Ja znam iz prakse da to nece funkcionisati u manjoj zajednici kao sto je Becej, prema tome prvi korak je dovesti lokalne organizacije u projekat i to ne tako sto ce reci \"mi smo za saradnju\" pa se nigdje ne pojave i ne ucestvuju u potrebnim inicijativama. Treba ljudi da shvate da to nece biti moj projekat vec njihov. Ja sad sve postavljam i razmisljam na takav nacin da projekat bude tu i za 20 godina, to je veliki izazov.

Former US president Barack Obama told a livestream town hall held by My Brother\u2019s Keeper alliance at the start of June that \u201ca far more representative cross-section\u201d of society has joined the current race protests compared to others in recent history.\n\nAcross Europe, countries have been confronting imbalanced systems that exacerbate privilege, power and oppression.\n\nThis week one of our members wrote a post highlighting how members of the community can support the deconstruction of the system of racial injustice and police brutality in the US [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794).\n\nAt a time when the world is challenging the inequality that underpins our societies, EdgeRyders\u2019 community has been discussing how we can reform and build new structures free of inequality.\n\nDecentralisation of power is one way of creating a fairer system, and one of our members started a conversation this week on how decentralised technologies can be created more effectively. [Take a look](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-do-decentralization-research-findings-7-maxims/13822) here.\n\nWe have also been looking at ways to build alternative systems to ones that profit from our need to connect. To move away from commercial social media channels, we have set up a telegram channel and would like to further develop our chatbot Alice for optimal user experience. If you think you\u2019ve got what it takes then have a look [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lets-talk-about-alice-and-how-to-have-a-good-conversation-with-and-edgeryders-chat-bot/13842).\n\nOne of our members attended a United Nations panel on the future of internet governance, a proposed structure that needs critical feedback. [Join in](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818) the conversation here, if you have thoughts on how it could be structured\n\nSpeaking about building things, a community member is looking for a [senior developer](https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-friendly-edtech-startup-you/13853) to fill a technical leadership role at an edtech startup.\n\nFinally, we are still in the process of creating an informative and engaging programme for our Livelihood summit in September and October. Our next listening session takes place on 22nd June and [brings together knowledge](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414) from higher education policy makers and workers, unions and human rights defenders to discuss the possibilities of making a living after years of study.\n\n---\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NZEulL30vdY\n\n### How to join us\n\nYou can introduce yourself to the community [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire). \n\nOur community managers @johncoate, @noemi and @MariaEuler will welcome you, and show you how everything works.\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n<Content id=\"Support our work\">\n<Text>\n\n## You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.** Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu)  /  [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg) \n\n</Text>\n</Content>\n\n</Webkit>", "created_at": "2020-06-19 06:34:07.833175", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 19:59:30.069403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 633, "wiki": true, "reads": 11, "score": 37.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57036, "user_id": 4794, "topic_id": 10375, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Dear all\n\nFor POPREBEL we want to speak to **anyone** in our target countries, whether they are populist, anti-populist or indifferent.

Such as:\n\n[quote=\"LornaJLacey, post:24, topic:14192\"]I find simple daily rituals such as, taking a walk before I start work and working out once I\u2019m finished for the day, helps me make that mental shift between the personal and professional areas of my life.[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"RoRemote, post:31, topic:14192\"]Since the (horror) experience of confinement here in Spain, I find I have to leave the apartment to concentrate fully and be focused. I need my coworking space to provide me with that support. So grateful for it![/quote]\n\nThat is surprising, as I have the the opposite in my own remote work philosophy, and am quite sure I'll not change that aspect. It's called \"full work-life integration\" in my mind, and really means that: I have no concept of \"after hours\" or \"weekend\" since I started self-employment in 2008, but I do have concepts of freedoms and flexibility that I use to mix work and non-work in my days. I usually mix in too much work, but to me that's a separate issue from \"is it advisable to mix\".\n\nI'll quickly explain how (I think) it works for me \u2026 maybe it provides some inspirations:\n\n* I want the freedom to switch between on-the-job activities and other activities at a moment's notice, and use that a lot. For mental wellbeing, I *need* the space to think, to follow ideas and inspirations during the day, to take two hours off and research about a new cool invention that popped up in my mind. The idea that an employer would force me into an office building and then force me to deal with on-the-job things for eight hours straight is horror to me, and a reason why I never took up such a job and instead became self-employed.\n\n* Me and two of my brothers (also remote digital workers) are the only people I know who *like* using a time tracking software to make the split between work and non-work at the push of a button. (We even all use the same time tracking tool called [tom-ui](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui), written by one of my brothers.) So while certainly unusual and perhaps due to genetics, for us it definitely helps: no need to feel bad when taking time off \"at work\" or working during my freetime, as designating time as work or not is just a click of a button, with the natural consequence of being paid for worktime and not paid for other time.\n\n* For claiming and using the mental freedom to work when you want and not work when you don't want, it definitely helps to be self-employed rather than being an employee. As an employee, it's natural to feel under pressure to answer immediately etc. to keep up a good impression among so-called \"superiors\", while as a self-employed person working among peers (or as a teamleader) the concern is rather with getting the project done in an efficient and enjoyable manner. And a need to answer immediately may just indicate a legacy culture of synchronous communication while remote work profits more from asynchronous, parallelized workstreams (at least [according to my manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/11263#heading--3-9)).\n\nI hope that nobody working with us here in Edgeryders feels pressurized to perform well in a system that \"we\" (whoever that is) have set up; in that mindset, it's natural to try to get away from work as far as possible in your hard-earned freetime. What I like to see is when people instead step up to improve the processes that make their work at Edgeryders tedious or boring or something that stresses them out when they have to touch it in their freetime. Haven't seen that too much in Edgeryders, but was happy to see that @amelia started such an initiative just a few days ago.", "created_at": "2020-09-25 00:00:40.705067", "updated_at": "2020-09-25 00:00:40.705067", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 763, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 233.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 5, "quote_count": 3, "quotes_posts": [82206, 82332, 83510], "is_reply_to": [82206, 82332, 83510], "is_liked_by": [2915, 3206, 3, 6442, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56890, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10383, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi @owen @noemi @inge  It's probably time to set a time for a longer video chat to go through point by point what needs to be fixed in the communication sites for Wellbeing.

Facebook's great advantage has always been that it largely trades on existing relationships and helps people build and grow that.  I wish, along with those benefits, we didn't get the egomania of the owner, the nanny state vibe, the never knowing what is exactly going on with your data and feeds, and the illusion of control...but I know that there are tradeoffs.\n\nI do lament that there is no meaningful competition for the top tier companies.

A group of around 20 writers collectively improvise a story on an online forum during an extensive amount of time. The resulting fiction is analyzed by a team of ethnographers and presented as an interactive web-based map. This map is then presented back to the group throughout the process. The final map is also presented as an interactive artwork in itself which the general public can explore.\n\n## Theoretical Exploration\nWe want to explore new ways to create and present collaboratively written literature. The best way to present a collective creative process is not necessarily in traditional form, but the nature of the process itself may require entirely new media formats to make the content comprehensible.\n\nBy presenting a co-created story as a map, we allow the spectators to explore the world the writers have collectively created. Because they themselves interact with the fiction and find their own ways through the maze, we break up the linear narrative we are otherwise accustomed to. Since the map of the connection between the various posts is the basis of the experience of the work, the written text becomes secondary to the actual story.\n\n## Collaborative Process\nWe let twenty invited co-writers write a co-created fiction for three, month-long cycles. Writing takes place on an online forum where each new posts and comment is considered a unique item. Each such post has a unique timestamp and sender.\n\nThe writers have no other rules except to follow the principle of \"yes, and.\" This means that we ask the writers to build on each other's ideas and not prevent or shoot down each other's creative processes.\n\n## Digital Ethnography & SSNA \nTo create the map, we use the latest technology in digital ethnography, called semantic social network analysis (SSNA). The process briefly states that a group of ethnographers analyze all the entries that the writers write on the forum, and gives each record one or more tags that can process all the content, from events to mood, tone, and more. Read more on SSNA in this paper.\n\nThese items and tags are visualized in an interactive network graph, which is the basis for the cartographic visualisation. \n\n## Why?\nCollective writing easily becomes unmanageably sprawling because it is difficult for any single participant to embrace the totality of the fiction they co-create. Unlike improvisation theater, live role-playing and other co-created art forms, collective writing takes place as correspondence where many threads are going on at the same time, while the writers are in very different environments and state of mind.\n\nThe role of the ethnographers is then to show the writers an overview of their collectively created fiction. The interactive network graph allows them to see which themes they themselves have been most involved in and which they have not yet explored, and which writers they often interact with and which they not. They also see which themes often occur together and can explore the history they themselves write from angles they have not seen before, allowing them to consciously allow them to converge or branch.\n\nThe writing takes place in three cycles each lasting one month. During the first cycle the writers write without seeing any ethnography. After the first cycle, the ethnographers complete the interactive map, which is then presented to the writers. Then the second cycle begins when the writers continue to write, but now with the map as a reference. After the second cycle, the second round of ethnography is concluded, and the writers then see the new map before they enter the last cycle. Then a final round of ethnography is made to produce the final map.\n\n# The Map\nWe intend to exhibit the final map, both as an interactive web-based map free for internet to explore, as well as a physical piece in an exhibition space. Both of these will be designed in the end of the project, when we have a better overview over the data.\n\nFor the audience, exploring the map becomes a boundless discovery of a world, where you yourself put together how everything is connected. The map becomes a book without beginning nor end. \n\nFor those who want to dive into the methods used all source material will be available, including interactive tools for exploring the graphs in the SSNA software used by the ethnographers. The project will also result in a research report describing how we have developed the technology behind SSNA and its application.\n\n## Collaboration with academia\nThis project is a collaboration with the Edgeryders Research Network, experts at the forefront of using digital ethnography to understand the depths of online conversations. Through having ethnographers and network scientists from Edgeryders on the team, we have access to the software, methods, and expertise that make SSNA possible to implement. \n\n## Final thoughts\nThe project creates a new artistic practice where collaborative processes and new technology reinforce each other. The basis of this practice is the self-reinforcing feedback loop that arises in the interaction between the writers and the ethnographers. In this way, we explore the possibilities for how literature and ethnography can interact in new forms of expression, while at the same time testing the boundaries of both areas.", "created_at": "2019-08-20 16:55:58.078880", "updated_at": "2020-11-07 23:30:11.235504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1464, "wiki": true, "reads": 57, "score": 5391.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [137, 4934, 4, 1856, 3323, 3, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40264, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7797, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-12-13 09:44:14.716919", "updated_at": "2017-12-13 09:44:14.922966", "deleted_at": "2017-12-13 09:51:35.764904", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78129, "user_id": 4877, "topic_id": 13537, "post_number": 10, "raw": "We can check 4 things on the go in news articles: \n1. if a term is trending \n2. which are the co-occurring terms\n3. sentiment of the paragraphs containing a terms (-1, 1)\n4. most pos/neg co-occurrences based on the sentiment of paragraphs containing both terms\n\npoints 2-4 take a few minutes to compute \n\nthe mentioned insights are very nuanced for this type of analysis, we can address them only in general  - we have some analyses on contact tracing (concepts, initiatives, open source projects), passport has not been picked up in the analysis (not trending)", "created_at": "2020-06-03 11:50:41.928476", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 11:50:41.928476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 99, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 43.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77537], "is_liked_by": [4, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73189, "user_id": 1520, "topic_id": 12097, "post_number": 15, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:1, topic:12097\"]\n**Mobile conversion kit for temporary spaces.** That\u2019s a different approach to having an \u201cown\u201d space, and much simpler to realize: have a container with a kit to transform any abandoned building into a comfortable space within 7 days for 1-3 years of temporary use, with 2 days at the end to take all of that equipment out again.

In this piece the author argues that, despite much of the hopeful talk many of us engage in, right-wing groups funded by the likes of the Koch brothers, are moving forward with plans to take advantage of the pandemic to lock down more changes that favor their position.  To me a lot of the tie-in to big Net companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. is they are led by people who, to me, also see themselves as thought leaders of aspects outside their expertise.  Schmidt assuming he knows how education is supposed to work, or Elon Musk talking about almost anything. Strong right-wing control that keeps todays hierarchies intact emboldens the tech leaders too.

Bristol is an example of a city that applies known tools of alternative economy and I thought it would be interesting to learn more about was is already working. \n\nWho are the top-notch economists of our days? Why do you believe that no one is trying to imagine a different economic system to the existing one? I am not economist nor researcher, you are better informed than I am. I based my knowledge on articles and movies that I watched about capitalism and the need and attempts to create a different system. And, the Oasis Game methodology which is depends partially on social solidarity (gift economy). For example: Entrepreneur Emmanuel Druon, CEO of the POCHECO company in the movie \"Demain\". He has applied \u201cecolonomical\u201d principles to his activities, guided by the three pillars of sustainable development : environment protection, respect of the employees and of social justice and productivity gains. Clearly, he has become a master in the art of producing more while being greener. He reconciles economy, ecology, human resources and profitable activities. He applies the principles of circular economy and limited growth in a ways. This is one example, there are also a couple of institute in the United States who are experimenting in the community their serve other economic systems.

We envision the regeneration of both the countryside and rural economies through the creation of\u00a0co-sufficient community farms rooted in agroecological\u00a0production.\n\nThe ALI is in advanced negotiations for the purchase of Red Pig Farm, near Brecon, Wales, which is intended to become the flagship location for the research and development of applied agroecological methods to produce food, fuel and fibre \u2013 and to do so using systems that are not merely\u00a0<em>sustainable</em>, but that actively repair and regenerate the degraded ecosystems we live with today.\n\nAt the heart of our endeavour is the principle of co-sufficiency, both within the farm community and in its relationship with the wider community. Progressive ownership, governance and co-housing models will allow members to live on-site in low impact housing, thus enabling the farm to incorporate multiple mutually supportive and synergistic rural enterprises, thereby making full use of the productive capacity of the land.\n\nThe local community will be served by the development of successful rural businesses and by the production of processed biomass as a means to meet local energy demands \u2013 there is also the potential to develop a community Energy Supply Company (ESCo) for small scale local heat and power generation. It is anticipated that this will be a significant factor in winning support for our project both from the local community and from the local planning authorities.\n\nThe ALI: Red Pig Farm project is currently seeking additional members and further financial investment to help fund the timely purchase of the farm .\n\nVisit:\u00a0<a href=\"http://agroecology.co.uk/\">http://agroecology.co.uk/</a>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-30 14:20:16", "updated_at": "2017-09-25 14:10:33.584088", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 375, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67686, "user_id": 6097, "topic_id": 12205, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Miluji cestov\u00e1n\u00ed!

Just arrived in Brussels and now that I\u2019ve managed to get some caffeine into my bloodstream, I\u2019m getting around to posting. \n\nI run a nonprofit called [Free Machine](http://www.freemachine.org/) and Cory Doctorow is one of our advisors -- when I saw what you had got him up to, my partner/co-founder and I bought tickets to Brussels. So:\n\n**Personal introduction**  My background is in experimental and participatory performance. For about a decade, I made work within a fine art context, with and about the relationship between humans and technology, developing structures that invited participants to interrogate the politics of their lived experiences. As I was doing my graduate work at Carnegie Mellon, I became interested in game design, and went to work for a VR startup in Los Angeles, which is where I found myself when the 2016 US election cycle hit. I felt that I needed to close the gap between my politics and my work, and I co-founded Free Machine together with a collective of artists, designers, and civic researchers. We make narrative experiences that function as platforms to educate, engage, and organize folks around a critical left technopolitics. Our first project is called [Future Perfect: A Postcapitalist Adventure](https://www.freemachine.org/futureperfect). We are currently at work on a set of programs gathered under the umbrella title, A Public Option for AI. My dayjob is at [Institute](http://www.iftf.org/)[for the Future](http://www.iftf.org/), where I research and design engagement programs around themes including the future of work, critical approaches to smart cities, and data equity. In fall 2020 I'll begin National Science Foundation-funded work on a Ph.D at Arizona State University in Human and Social Dimensions in Science and Technology. \n\n**My interest in the Lab**  SF, as Donna Haraway glosses it, is more than just science fiction--it is speculative fabulation, structural feminism, string figures. I believe passionately that SF is a necessary set of tools in the business of bending the future towards equity, inclusion, sustainability, and abundance. To metabolize an adversary's insight: politics is downstream of culture. (This is Breitbart's mantra.) And the minimum viable product of culture is a story. So this is one important function of SF: to translate the dryness of social science into the marshes of imagination and emotion, where it must go in order to transform philosophy and theory into a movement. The capacity to render (as Cory Doctorow does so masterfully) the abstract into the human is necessary for movement-building. \n\nOf course, SF impacts not only the audience but the author. By casting our gaze into a world that is not our own, we jettison near-term political baggage (can this pass a vote in Parliament today?) in favor of visionary inspiration (what  *could*  our country look like in 15 years if our wildest dreams were realized?). This invites deeper, more meaningful questions to be asked and attempted. The possibility-space for problem-solving opens dramatically, and one finds oneself provoked by what may be found there. So, these possibilities are why I am drawn to the SF Economics Lab: the chance to catalyze provocative social science speculative thinking, and to translate visions of a more just and equitable future society into a form where they might root down into a popular movement. \n\n**Prospects for work with the Lab**  I am deeply interested in how data is conceptualized at various levels: by cultures, by academia, by industry, by government, and by individuals. I believe that there is potential for catalyzing popular social movements around the concepts of data rights and data ownership, as data takes on an ever-more central role in economies worldwide. Data cooperatives, trusts, unions, guilds, and/or any other associational configuration -- these are proposals and phenomena that I wish to explore together with economists and other social scientists within a speculative framework. I believe that by defining various speculative future economic systems based on different configurations of ownership, rights, and commodification of data, we can expose the politics implicit in the decisions we make individually today, and envision how we could enact our politics through collective organized power in the future. \n\nI am also interested in exploring speculative futures premised on cooperative structures, particularly in relationship to machine learning systems. For the last year I have been collaborating with SF author [Cadwell Turnbull ](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18175285/cadwell-turnbull-sci-fi-story-common-ai-climate-change-better-worlds)on the development of what will become an anthology of short SF stories, written by different authors but sharing a future world in which collectively-owned AI are commonplace. We imagine these stories as a collection of use cases and cautionary tales, aimed to illustrate what a machine learning system owned and governed by its stakeholders might look like. This is a topic I would also be interested in collaboratively exploring. \n\nBesides these specific topics, I am very interested in facilitation. As part of the development of my collaboration with Turnbull, I've lead workshops with the Tech Workers Coalition to envision different cooperatively-owned and -operated products and services in city-specific future settings. As in: come up with some cooperatively-developed AI products that might arise in Chicago in the year 2035, given the historical, social, and environmental qualities of that city. In fact, I am coming to the SF Economics Lab launch from New York, where I lead another of these workshops (called Imagining Common Futures) as part of the Platform Coop Conference there. \n\nMy work at Institute for the Future involves me doing research on a particular sector or issue, then processing that information into future scenarios in the form of not just written reports/papers, but objects ('future artifacts'), performance (protests from the future), and immersive role-playing experiences. I would be extremely excited to work with the SF Economics Lab to imagine ways of translating the output of discrete papers/projects into public/stakeholder engagement.\n\nThrilled to join you all, and looking forward to meeting at least some of you in person over the next few days.", "created_at": "2019-11-10 11:38:35.028771", "updated_at": "2019-11-10 11:38:35.028771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1030, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 33.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [315], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23032, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1782, "post_number": 18, "raw": "I recently came across an intersesting artist collective that use gridbeam like construction for some of their thought provoking projects <a href=\"http://www.n55.dk/\">http://www.n55.dk/</a>\n\nProbably more relevant to this conversation is the stuff about furnitecture in this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19g_XYezo_jHEZINUqZNZUswZaLsuNHpvbsT3vNkW3eU/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p\">presentation</a> by Eric Hunting who was inspired by <a href=\"/u/dante\">Dante</a>- In pasting the link to Dantes page I just noticed he's also linked the presentation from there along with other relevant stuff :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-17 22:49:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.877145", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 104, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23012], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29227, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 1851, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Stepping out:</b>\n\nI'm stepping out of the way so this debate can continue without my bogging it down. I really hope the community engage this one as Alberto has\u00a0cited a few very very sticky points there that a lot of people will have a lot to say about. Please speak up.\n\nBefore stepping out though I would like to draw attention to the difference between two types of agency among two types of agent. There are human agents, and there are non-human agents. There is the motivational agency and the intentional agency. A human can be motivated, acting in such a way that their activity is not necessarily rationalized, preconceived, evaluated, or focally directed. They do what they do because they 'are passionate', or perhaps they 'know its the right thing to do'.\u00a0\n\nIntentional agency applies to non-humans as well as humans. A computer program can be intentional in that it acts according to programmatic criteria, it intends results, having goals, and planned processes to achieve those goals. Business plans are intentional, and human beings initially 'motivated' can also pass through hybridization and can\u00a0become wholly\u00a0intentional agents (soldiers, spys, police, investors...).\n\nI am motivated by honesty, truth, and the will to live and lean with life toward these values. I'm aware that the Romans used to kidnap Saxon chiefs and have them\n\n'sign up' for Christianity by force, knowing that this would be their saving grace later amidst the inevitability of the Saxon's eventual overpowering of the Empire. Thus the Holy Roman Empire, the Golden Bull, and the societal evolution of the last 1500 or so years.\u00a0\n\nNow we are faced with another bull, the Bronze of Wall St. And you are asked not to consider your values, but instead focus on the goal...forget your inherently human motivation, focus, rather, with intent...\n\nThe choice will be yours.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-12 19:04:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.749117", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 334, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60665, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10733, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hey Nat, did you guys figure out stuff like venues and date and things? \n\nIn the meantime, I think it might be good to require every organiser of a local event to put a footer with FAQs and answers adapted to this project (i.e changing the name of the funding source/grant) and links to special sign up forms if you have them (in their own language) - so people know exactly what to expect... :) https://edgeryders.eu/t/frequently-asked-questions-section-to-add-to-festival-event-posts/10982\n\nping @noemi", "created_at": "2019-10-04 12:03:10.668258", "updated_at": "2019-10-04 12:03:10.668258", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 92, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55822, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10250, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We had our weekly content curation call in which community managers share with the comms team what's going on in their neck of the woods.

It could be that planning the meetups after the online calls will help people get closer to what the online can result in. - The Student Brunch seems similar, and I guess it can be made less costly by just having informal coffee&cake style conversations.\n\nAmazing report, thank you!", "created_at": "2019-01-10 19:40:17.856711", "updated_at": "2019-01-10 19:40:17.856711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 271, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 28.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [49995], "is_reply_to": [49995], "is_liked_by": [3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74798, "user_id": 5647, "topic_id": 13282, "post_number": 1, "raw": "[date=2020-05-07 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"] \u2192 [date=2020-05-11 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]\n\n![WHO-Briand%208x8%20circle|690x690](upload://kjZVNxDdU9UvwwgbqRM08v4M5jp.jpeg) \n1.

What stage are you in?\nUnderway. Project launches in two weeks. We are designing the challenge now and beginning to recruit volunteers and participants.\n\n3. What call are you answering, grant are you applying for or what other goal do you have with the text/presentation you are crafting??\nNA. This a grassroots effort not based on a call.\n\n4. What do you need concrete help with? People? Skills? Guidance? Clarity?\nIf you would like to join the organizing team, please fill out this survey:\nhttps://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/T2B3Fr. We are looking for people who want to help design and deliver the challenge, including mentors, outreach, social media ambassadors,  and other roles.\nPlease add any suggestions for judges, experts, and sponsors in this thread.\n@nadia @lylycarrillo @MariaEuler: would Edgeryders be a partner?", "created_at": "2020-04-21 22:39:33.568944", "updated_at": "2020-04-27 15:20:43.068139", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 271, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 63.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78090, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9766, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Maybe of interest for some here:\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/online-free-talk-about-car-cognition-at-driverlessworldschool/13750", "created_at": "2020-06-03 09:28:29.855363", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 09:28:29.855363", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 2.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [78045], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60995, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11041, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hey Peter,\n\nSo I have thought about how we can involve more people in contributing to developing this session (and the broader conversation). The simplest way is to plug into the distributed collaboration process through which the comms and community management crews are coordinating.

Update your event description above with the following:\n   * Add a question that you want to answer through the session\n   * Add an Faq Section (you can copy paste the one on my workshop description)\n   * Add a description of the format. if you can make it a bit interactive or identify a specific methodology you will be using that's great. _Feel free to ask if you need help with this_\n\n2. Make it easy for us to promote it:\n   * Give @MariaEuler photos + statements/quotes she can use to customise design for a flyer and for a header for this event. \n\n3. See what you think of this approach to one on one outreach for getting good input to help you develop the session, and the broader discussion you wish to build around the topics of your fellowship: \n\n      * You send emails with to people you think can contribute to this discussion with personalised invitation using content from the one I forwarded you as a template/model\n       * If they agree you can forward them to a member of Edgeryders staff (@inge for now)  who then does the interview & transcribes content, and helps them to get on platform. You would need to agree with her on what questions you would like to ask...\n      \n3. Read the articles posted by the contributers and write a summary. Perhaps you can also draw help from the data analysis team to make visualisations that can help you synthesise what is there and share it back with a nice visual graph.

There was a SSL certificate change of the riot.im server's certificate recently. On my side I see yet another one than the one Natalia mentioned, but that is possible because Riot uses Cloudflare, and Cloudflare has many certificates for its many subdomains which it somehow uses to work against possible DDoS attacks.\n\nFor the web version, the Cloudflare certificate changed on 2019-07-11, but they might have rolled out / installed the certificate a few days after obtaining it, so that could still fit for the timing that Natalia has observed. And it would explain why the app still works while the browser version (which uses Cloudflare) had issues. Because the app does not use Cloudflare:\n\n> if you don't want to rely on Cloudflare's availability to access a Riot client, you can download the electron client, or a mobile app, or host your own Riot web instance, or use one hosted by somebody else ([source](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/8691#issuecomment-464013184))\n\nSo I _think_ there is no danger implied in that certificate warning. To be sure, I would however need to know what server the certificate change is about (as that is not mentioned in the error message Natalia got). So, @natalia_skoczylas, could you visit https://riot.im/app/ and click on the lock symbol in the browser's address bar and copy & paste the values of \"Common Name (CN)\" and \"SHA-256 Fingerprint\" of the certificate of that site? Let's see if it is the same as the one you go the error message for.

In fact, the lean canvas is a different adaptation from the original business model by making the canvas actionable. While keeping the same space, 4 blocks were removed from the original model, to make room for 4 new blocks, that are respectively: Problem, solution, key metrics and Unfair advantage. Then he commenced to describe each bloc and how to fill it according to a certain order.\n \n**![|490x335](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cwwHYwKBHYEvwMwCHcA2iSwBq2gp3vniOsPOGy9xpxwYM1pMbhlKT3WujqhsGKyVUU0IKWW8iVY8NL5A_o3ec__hADF0hDk2wF29QQuIvqNncMqkx1BRd-00uk90s4_VJdtJwzBi)**\n\n\nEach part of the canvas was well explained and illustrated with examples. \n\nAs a matter of fact, the lean canvas\u2019 blocs are reunited into two parts: the product and the market part.\nFollowing the description of the blocs in each part, there was a break in which questions from the project leaders were asked, thus, certain ambiguities regarding their projects were clarified.  \n\nTowards the end of the lab, in order to process the lean canvas, a full detailed example of the Uber London lean canvas was displayed to perceive a real example and understand the concept. \n\nAt last, @khouloud.ouesleti  shared the offline tasks while indicating that they need to deliver them in time and respect the deadlines which is the 10th of January 2020. Mainly, the tasks consists of preparing the lean business canvas, the action plan and their project skills matrix. She has also communicated an advice regarding the human resources needed concerning each project, in order for the OCI lab team to match between the project leaders and the potential contributor who will eventually help them with the prototyping process. \n\nPlease know that the labs are open to everyone.

The director has always sought to avoid the voluntourism stigma though and is very selective of who he sends out, for example he sends a lot of professional nurses or teachers out who are either retired or need experience abroad.

Intro\n\nTunisia is a country, like most MENA countries, where there is spatial disparities in opportunities. _\u201cThe poverty rate varies from approximately 8 percent in the center-east region to 32 percent in the center-west region\"_ (World Bank , 2015).\u201d  \n\nWith a booming civil society and enthusiastic youth  trying to re-imagine their country after the 2011 revolution, social enterprises appears as a way to bring services to the marginalized and poor communities changing the model of charity to a model of revenue-generating enterprises; as usually youth tends to go beyond the normal widely adopted charitable model of aid. \n\nso the  SE scene is relatively new in Tunisia, Most of the SEs were initiated after \u201cArab spring\u201d  and the older ones are more or less 2 years older. In a report done by the world bank almost half of the mapped SEs ( 25 out of 51) are still at the ideation or early piloting stage, and only 7 % have scaled their operations. \n\nThere are lots of enthusiasm and the Social entrepreneurship model is being promoted by several entities and it is expanding, nevertheless there is no systematic data about it yet in Tunisia.\n\n\n## 2. Who are the Social entrepreneurs\n\nMost reports, with one exception mentioning that their sample was gender balanced, agree that the \u201crecognized\u201d social entrepreneur in the region is mainly young, male ( relatively more), and well educated ( holding a post secondary degree at least ).\n\nThis means that most of the \u201crecognized\u201d social entrepreneur fitting this profile can speak another language ( English or French ) and could be supported either by family or an institution, or in rare cases him/herself, to pursue a university degree.\n\nI would argue that this needs to change, this profile doesn't cover other people( like habiba for example ) and most probably the reason for fewer female entrepreneurs is that the supporting ecosystem that recognize the social entrepreneur caters for urban centers dwellers (source[:wamda report](https://wamda-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/resource-url/e2981f10ea87448.pdf)) (Halabi, Kheir, & Cochrane, 2017)\u2060 and it is more difficult for young women to relocate, it is relatively easier for their male peers.\n\n\n## 3. Quick overview / Main challenges\n\nDuring the past years different programs were initiated to support small and medium enterprises, whether with providing skills and trainings or micro-finance, still one of the main challenges is \u201caccess to finance\u201d, Also \u201cfunding agencies note the lack of a strong pipeline of SEs that passed the early ideation and piloting stage and are fully operational\u201d ; Return of investments is very low especially for the SEs targeting customers with a low paying capacity.\n\nSo Mainly SEs depend on international organizations ( GIZ, GIZ, AfDB, Oxfam, UNDP, AfD and the European Union ) for funding, Currently commercial and governmental sources exist but not easily accessible as the process \u201ctakes a lot of time and effort with uncertain results\u201d \n\nSo the status quo for the funding for early stage SE ( ideation and pilot stages ) is :\n\n1. family and friends\n2. seed capital primarily in the form of preferential loans/grants \n3. investment funds like Yunus Social Business (YSB) which also received financing from a Tunisian source, the Arab Tunisian Bank,\n4. Rarely commercial bank loans\n5. Also ENDA is getting into the scene with a micro-finance program @soheyb ? \n\nAnother remark that is noticed that there are no proper easily accessible channels for knowledge transfer ( couldn't find them online) \n\nThe policies are not the best in Tunisia, but hopefully  a new legislation is supposed to be applied soon that should ease the legal challenges in Tunisia. ( mentioned in the world bank report in 2017 and according to @Sofien-Dahem  the law is not yet applied and expected may be by early 2019  ? )\n\n\n## 4. Case studies\n\nThe Figures below, from a comparative case study by the world bank group 2017 ) show 4 different SEs.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3ad72a4aa6ccbcc7a5d51a57919a6e02f4e6bc93.png\">\n\nAs shown only one was able to scale and it is a commercial waste management company started financially by the founder\u2019s own savings and a small funding from a Finnish partner ( where she worked before, before this she was a secondary school teacher and got to know the semi-buried containers on a trip to Germany in 2006 ). \u201cIt is the only SE that has a growing revenue stream caters to the private sector as its customer.\u201d\n\n\nKolna Herfa  is an innovative handicraft social enterprise ( received a grant from the International Office of Migration, which funded the initial capital and operational expenses ) adopted a financial model where revenue is based on sales and 70 % of profit  goes to the woman artisan and the rest for manager salaries and reinvested in the company. \u201cHowever, sales have been declining,and Kolna Hirfa did not succeed in receiving commercial credits. Production has also declined as a result,and 60 percent of women associates left the company due to low profits.\u201d \n\nThey trained 39 women and achieved \u201csoft\u201d benefits of course during the process, but the financial model couldn\u2019t sustain the company financially. \n\n(@sofien-dahem I think kolna herfa model should be studied and even we should start a dialogue with them in order not to make the same mistakes with [TANDA](https://edgeryders.eu/t/tanda-preservation-and-modernisation-of-the-african-handcrafts-heritage/8687))\n\n\n## 5. Way forward as a community\n\nWith the new legislation it should be easier for new social enterprises to rise ( it's a bit slow  progress from the state's side but there is progress ) \n\nAs an outsider, it seems like that is getting better for the Tunisian youth, still a lot of work to do, the scene is expanding in most of the country and this offers a lot of opportunities but also we need to be careful not to slide into what could be called a [neo-libral takeover](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/a_neoliberal_takeover_of_social_entrepreneurship) for social entrepreneurship. ( as most probably this opportunities comes with the country applying a neoliberal agenda following the proper \u201cdevelopment\u201d path )\n\nThere are lots of training programs, business model workshops and so on, but still no proper way of  (well documented) knowledge transfer. \n\nMost of the reports mention having a community is essential for a healthy ecosystem which we can see happening everyday in edgeryders, there was a trial to start something like this in Tunisia but it didn't catch up and I believe we have a good opportunity to build a solid community sharing  beneficial practical knowledge in a local context )\n\nSo what we could do as an online community in order to move forward is:\n\n1. Start documenting  the undocumented processes ( The ones that we know from experience, for example if @yosser passed through the long complicated process of getting a loan, documenting this in a wiki in Arabic and/or French would be very helpful for others trying to start, especially from small towns like Medenine and can't can't find this info anywhere online - I guess you discussed something like this with @matthias and the [digital Medenine](https://edgeryders.eu/t/digital-medenine-an-initiative-by-ourghema/8780/4) crowd before  ) \n\n2. Seizing the opportunities of working together in small towns and start connecting, sharing knowledge and collaborating with a wider online community, for example it was mentioned in [a video](https://www.facebook.com/zitounatv.official/videos/1157821637681794/?hc_ref=ARQukBlCFuU8msU5iUDfO5OHqtPpz14iaSVj9fOmQT0I2oCzKim-5F8CTeWEP96yOJM) report on hydroponics in Medenine ( a project supported by a [local NGO](https://www.facebook.com/EDA.medenine/) where they bought the land and young entrepreneurs use it for free for the 1st  5 years then they should start paying rent ) that there was other international hydroponics projects but there was not a proper way of knowledge transfer, actually if we can reach out to them to document their process online this would help others in  the southern Tunisia to do the same, Also  potential knowledge transfer and business opportunities with others who do the same in Egypt for example.  ( I guess @yosser and the medenine crowd are in contact, what do you guys think about their work as I only know from a Fb page ) \n\n3. whether a project needs to scale up or not , it is always appreciated that the project could be replicated, so start properly documenting our project ideas, this way application comes faster.\n\n4. We can also start mapping our needs as a community, so we know what skills are needed, this way we could together curate/ propose a course in the academy that could help others as well. \n5. Reaching out to other small town communities and start working together like what @Islem is planning to do in Kebili. \n\nThat's just  the basics steps that could work on steady steps building a better ecosystem outside the focal points of the normal one, what do you guys think ? This are some outsiders notes but what do you guys on the ground think about this and how do you see yourself in this ?\n\n\n---\n\n\n[text-direction=rtl]\n\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0636\u064a\u062a \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0641\u0649 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u062a\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641\u0629 \u0628\u0625\u0633\u0645 \"\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\ufef7\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0648\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0627\" , \u0647\u0630\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0636\u0627\u062a\u0649 \u0639\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u064a\u0627\u0643\u0645   \n\n\u0641\u0649 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0625\u0646\u0646\u0649 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0641\u0644\n\n\n## \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0629\n\n\u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0631\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0648\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0635 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u062a\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0639 \u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631  \u0625\u0644\u064a 32% \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u06448% \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f.\n\n\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0632\u062f\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u0649 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0645\u0633 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 , \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0628\u0646\u0649 \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645  \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0648\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0645\u0634\u0629 \u0643\u0646\u0637\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u064a\u0644 \u0623\u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0632\u064a \u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0627\u062a . \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f\u064a.

Lately, my focus was on social entrepreneurship. This time, I had the chance to take this initiative on an individual level. Hence, the OCI Lab allowed me to coordinate the offline event: Webinar \"Power Pitch and Storytelling,\" and it was a great experience. \nThe webinar airing took place at a little cozy co-working space at Beirut Lebanon, The Olive Grove Hamra.\nThe attendees were young full of energetic vibes(Age range 20-29). They enjoyed the spirit of the space since start-ups' offices surrounded them. The attendance was composed of 9 people attended, five women and four men, and we started with an ice-breaking session to get to know each other. What's exciting and makes the offline event special is the participant's diversity we had; among us, there was a YouTuber, a computer scientist, event planner, international affairs student. Etc. After the ice-breaking activity, we had a small discussion about the participant's motivation to attend the offline event; they were mainly looking to be inspired to do something. The feedbacks were positive; the attendees enjoyed how active the session was. \nThe main challenge was the time zone issue;![lebanon|617x411](upload://pDN1AEH9IARbooAsOx98pkUhS32.png)", "created_at": "2020-02-20 08:42:22.444787", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:23:33.040342", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 266, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 113.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5547, 8, 3703, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68010, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Sounds good.

M\u00eame si la plupart du temps ils font pas mal le mouton, il arrive qu'on leur laisse un peu de libert\u00e9 pour penser quelques instants par eux-m\u00eame. Il y a des d\u00e9bats entre candidats de diff\u00e9rents partis, qui ont lieu dans chacune des circonscriptions. La plupart du temps, les candidats sont fig\u00e9s dans la discipline du parti. Il y a des exceptions, quand un candidat a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une expertise dans un domaine en particulier. De temps \u00e0 autre, un parti va mettre en valeur tel ou tel candidat(e) pour ses id\u00e9es ou comp\u00e9tences dans un domaine.

Most complex challenges (like getting food on the table for your family from a hundred sources and locations), are not one well-defined problem (grow apples), but a constellation of interdependent issues (transportation logistics, factory sorting and processing, demand & supply negotiations, regulation etc) undergoing constant redefinition and renegotiation. Any one organisation, no matter how efficient and smart, has no hope of containing any such challenge.\n\nAt the same time we see that in the face of large shocks to the system, organisations optimised for efficiency and profit cannot provide the means for material, relational, and existential resilience of neither individual nor society at large. Case in point: When supply chains are broken, even benevolent governments in affluent countries cannot access the equipment or protective gear to protect frontline workers on which we all depend to stay alive.\n\nOn the other hand, communities are getting smarter. The Internet has produced decentralized, scalable tools for coordination, archiving, and retrieval. It has also spawned cultural practices and ethical rules that incentivize people to collaborate with strangers. As a result, leaderless \u201cswarms\u201d of dedicated citizen experts are writing encyclopedias, mapping the Earth, doing science, developing and maintaining complex, successful software stacks. In each of these areas they outperform powerful businesses and government initiatives.\n\nThese initiatives display uncanny speed and efficiency, because communities are better than organizational hierarchies at making use of human intelligence. They treat every person \u2013 not just the top echelon \u2013 as a potential or actual expert, rather than as a passive consumer or beneficiary. They ask people to help, rather than charting their needs, and they have more human talent to throw at problems. They weed out under-performing initiatives in a healthy and natural way, making way for new life to emerge.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s a good example of the combined power of Smart Swarms to change the world. We all use it every day, and it\u2019s taking effective action on both poverty (poor people are using it too, all over the world!) and ecology (it\u2019s saving huge numbers of trees on paper books.) People are working together to solve a real human problem - access to knowledge - and it\u2019s improving everyone\u2019s lives. There\u2019s a tiny thread of financial capital \u2013 running the servers, say \u2013 but Wikipedia is a community-driven enterprise. It shows what can be done.\n\nWe want to achieve resilient lives and livelihoods. Contributing to Wikipedia doesn\u2019t put food on the table or ensure that communities support one another to mitigate the consequences of social distancing. Or even keep our mental health intact when automation wipes out the need for many professions, the foundation on which many of us build our identity and sense of purpose. We need to use a similar kind of effect to meet the material, relational, and existential needs of individuals and communities. And we need to develop sources of prosperity that secure their resilience by serving these needs.\n\nThis is not just semantics: it is about reframing livelihood generation from a lonely, competitive activity that only is accessible if you have money to sustain yourself while you build your business or have specialised training. To one that is collaborative, mutualistic, and accessible to all, regardless of your personal background. We frame the building of sustainable economic livelihoods as that of building an ecosystem, made up of many overlapping circles of people engaging in different activities. Commercial activity always relied on cooperation more than competition (but that was called an old boys club).\n\nThis summit is part of a series of activities aimed at co-designing experimental new social, business and investment models to withstand the shocks which will besoon be upon us as climate crisis and ecological devastation unfold.

I also thought about the Council of Europe, which is an organisation many would blame for not being fully accountable of tax money spent, programmes with little impact or what not,\u00a0yet it's not a building or one guy behind it, it's a sum of people and diverse interests, many times conflicting.
